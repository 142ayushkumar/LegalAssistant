b'<p class="sent_item" id="3.00409258983">\n It is the case of the appellant that 1st appellant at the request of the respondent procured 145 bales and kept for long time with the dealers place and as the respondent failed to make payment despite for waiting long duration, the 1st appellant had stored the 145 bales of cotton in the Central Ware House at Akola on 18.03.2004 by paying regular rent and it was being extended from time to time and still the bales procured for him is remain at Central Ware House, Akola.\n</p>\n'

Veeranna Shivalingappa Konjalgi [1976 (3) SCC 736 1976 Indlaw SC 621], it was held that the Magistrate while issuing process against the accused should satisfy himself as to whether the allegations in the complaint, if proved, would ultimately end in the conviction of the accused.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="0">\n It was held that the order of Magistrate issuing process against the accused could be quashed under the following circumstances: "(1) Where the allegations made in the complaint or the statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the accused; (2) Where the allegations made in the complaint are patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused; (3) Where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in issuing process is capricious and arbitrary having been based either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly irrelevant or inadmissible; and (4) Where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal defects, such as, want of sanction, or absence of a complaint by legally competent authority and the like."\n</p>\n'

b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.01696431375">\n 161 and 165 IPC and S. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was proper and legal.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.96498206695">\n Reversing the order passed by the High Court, this Court explained the circumstances under which such power could be exercised.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.64727532647">\n Apart from reiterating the earlier norms laid down by this Court, it was further explained that such power could be exercised where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="1.78564704875">\n However, this Court in Rupan Deol Bajaj v. Kanwar Pal 1995 Indlaw SC 1896 10.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.51735038709">\n Singh Gill [1995 (6) SCC 194] held that "at the stage of quashing an FIR or complaint the High Court is not justified in embarking upon an inquiry as to the probability, reliability or genuineness of the allegations made therein".\n</p>\n'

b'<p class="sent_item" id="1.06474099843">\n In this case, the matter related to the stridhan property.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.27424261603">\n The complainant alleged that her husband, father-in-law and other relatives misappropriated her jewellery and other valuable articles entrusted to them by her parents at the time of marriage.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.34126675889">\n The complainant alleged that these dowry articles were meant for her exclusive use and that the accused misbehaved and maltreated her and ultimately he turned her out without returning the dowry articles.\n</p>\n'

b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.57815701072">\n 482 for quashing the criminal proceedings and the High Court quashed the same.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.73379787115">\n The accused contended that the dispute was of a civil nature and no criminal prosecution would lie.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.59514472683">\n Under that circumstance, this Court held as under: "There are a large number of cases where criminal law and civil law can run side by side.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.11452152006">\n The two remedies are not mutually exclusive but clearly coextensive and essentially differ in their content and consequence.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.27662941218">\n The object of the criminal law is to punish an offender who commits an offence against a person, property or the State for which the accused, on proof of the offence, is deprived of his liberty and in some cases even his life.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="1.95261556276">\n This does not, however, affect the civil remedies at all for suing the wrongdoer in cases like arson, accidents, etc.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.68351305252">\n It is an anathema to suppose that when a civil remedy is available, a criminal prosecution is completely barred.\n</p>\n'

b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.24026548978">\n The principles, relevant to our purpose are : (i) A complaint can be quashed where the allegations made in the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety, do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out the case alleged against the accused.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.05680777836">\n For this purpose, the complaint has to be examined as a whole, but without examining the merits of the allegations.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.05735194757">\n Neither a detailed inquiry nor a meticulous analysis of the material nor an assessment of the reliability or genuineness of the allegations in the complaint, is warranted while examining prayer for quashing of a complaint.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.48193860973">\n (ii) A complaint may also be quashed where it is a clear abuse of the process of the court, as when the criminal proceeding is found to have been initiated with mala fides/malice for wreaking vengeance or to cause harm, or where the allegations are absurd and inherently improbable.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.05255193923">\n (iii) The power to quash shall not, however, be used to stifle or scuttle a legitimate prosecution.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="1.76574301715">\n The power should be used sparingly and with abundant caution.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.64767745699">\n (iv) The complaint is not required to verbatim reproduce the legal ingredients of the offence alleged.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.2592993752">\n If the necessary factual foundation is laid in the complaint, merely on the ground that a few ingredients have not been stated in detail, the proceedings should not be quashed.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.24414041049">\n Quashing of the complaint is warranted only where the complaint is so bereft of even the basic facts which are absolutely necessary for making out the offence.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="1.99376499758">\n (v) A given set of facts may make out: (a) purely a civil wrong; or (b) purely a criminal offence; or (c) a civil wrong as also a criminal offence.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.4206684282">\n A commercial transaction or a contractual dispute, apart from furnishing a cause of action for seeking remedy in civil law, may also involve a criminal offence.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.49106608295">\n As the nature and scope of a civil proceeding are different from a criminal proceeding, the mere fact that the complaint relates to a commercial transaction or breach of contract, for which a civil remedy is available or has been availed, is not by itself a ground to quash the criminal proceedings.\n</p>\n'

b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.55437696505">\n 420 or Section 120-B IPC and the present case is a case of purely civil dispute between the parties for which remedy lies before a civil court by filing a properly constituted suit.\n</p>\n'
b'<p class="sent_item" id="2.48982019496">\n In our opinion, in view of these facts allowing the police investigation to continue would amount to an abuse of the process of court and to prevent the same it was just and expedient for the High Court to quash the same by exercising the powers u/s.\n</p>\n'
