(e) A, a warehouse-keeper, is charged with the delivery of certain goods to Z, which B takes out of A's possession.A may sue B for the goods. See now the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Act 5 of 1908).
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 11--> Any person having the possession or control of a particular article of movable property, of which he is not the owner, may be compelled specifically to deliver it to the person entitled to its immediate possession, in any of the following cases:- (a) when the thing claimed is held by the defendant as the agent or trustee of the claimant; (b) when compensation in money would not afford the claimant adequate relief for the loss of the thing claimed; (c) when it \would be extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damage caused by its loss; (d) when the possession of the thing claimed has been wrongfully transferred from the claimant. Illustrations of clause (a)- A, proceeding to Europe, leaves his furniture in charge of B as his agent during his absence.B, without A's authority, pledges the furniture to C, and C, knowing that B had no right to pledge the furniture, advertises it for sale.C may be compelled to deliver the furniture to A, for he holds it as A's trustee. of clause (b)- Z has got possession of an idol belonging to A's family, and of which A is the proper custodian.Z may be compelled to deliver the idol to A. of clause (c)- A is entitled to a picture by a dead painter and a pair of rare China vases.B has possession of them.The articles are of too special a character to bear an ascertainable market-value.B may be compelled to deliver them to A.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 12--> Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, the specific performance of any contract may in the discretion of the Court be enforced- (a) when the act agreed to be done is in the performance, wholly or partly, of a trust; (b) when there exists no standard for ascertaining the actual damage caused by the non-performance of the act agreed to be done; (c) when the act agreed to be done is such that pecuniary compensation for its non-performance would not afford adequate relief; or (d) when it is probable that pecuniary compensation cannot be got for the non-performance of the act agreed to be done. Explanation-Unless and until the contrary is proved, the Court shall presume that the breach of a contract to transfer immovable property cannot be adequately relieved by compensation in money, and that the breach of a contract to transfer movable property can be thus relieved.Illustrations of clause (a)- 1 A holds certain stock in trust for B.A wrongfully disposes of the stock.The law creates an obligation on A to restore the same quantity of stock to B, and B may enforce specific performance of this obligation. of clause (b)- A agrees to buy, and B agrees to sell, a picture by a dead painter and two rare China vases.A may compel B specifically to perform this contract, for there is no standard for ascertaining the actual damage which would be caused by its non-performance. of clause (c)- A contracts with B to sell him a house for Rs.1,000.B is entitled to a decree directing A to convey the house to him, he paying the purchase-money. In consideration of being released from certain obligations imposed on it by its Act of Incorporation, a railway-company contract with Z to make an archway through their railway to connect lands of Z severed by the railway, to construct a road between certain specified points, to pay a certain annual sum towards the maintenance of this road, and also to construct a siding and a wharf as specified in the contract.Z is entitled to have this contract specifically enforced, for his interest in its performance cannot be adequately compensated for by money; and the Court may appoint a proper person to superintend the construction of the archway, road, siding and wharf. A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, a certain number of railway-shares of a particular description.A refuses to complete the sale.B may compel A specifically to perform this agreement, for the shares are limited in number and not always to be had in the market, and their possession carries with it the status of a shareholder, which cannot otherwise be procured. A contracts with B to paint a picture for B, who agrees to pay therefor Rs.1,000.The picture is painted.B is entitled to have it delivered to him on payment or tender of the Rs.1,000. of clause (d)- A transfers without endorsement, but for valuable consideration, a promissory note to B.A becomes insolvent, and C is appointed his assignee.B may compel C to endorse the note, for C has succeeded to A's liabilities, and a decree for pecuniary compensation for not endorsing the note would be fruitless. This illustration is Repealed wherever the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 (2 of 1882), is in force-see ss.1 and 2 of that Act.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 13--> Notwithstanding anything contained in section 56 of the Indian Contract Act (9 of 1872), a contract is not wholly impossible of performance because a portion of its subject-matter, existing at its date, has ceased to exist at the time of the performance. Illustrations (a) A contracts to sell a house to B for a lakh of rupees.The day after the contract is made, the house is destroyed by a cyclone.B may be compelled to perform his part of the contract by paying the purchase-money. (b) In consideration of a sum of money payable by B, A contracts to grant an annuity to B for B's life.The day after the contract has been made, B is thrown from his horse and killed.B's representative may be compelled to pay the purchase-money.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 14--> Where a party to a contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, but the part which must be left unperformed bears only a small proportion to the whole in value, and admits of compensation in money, the Court may, at the suit of either party, direct the specific performance of so much of the contract as can be performed, and is award compensation in money for the deficiency. Illustrations (a) A contracts to sell B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas.It turns out that 98 bighas of the land belong to A, and the two remaining bighas to a stranger, who refuses to part with them.The two bighas are not necessary for the use or enjoyment of the 98 bighas, nor so important for such use or enjoyment that the loss of them may not be made good in money.A may be directed at the suit of B to convey to B the 98 bighas and to make compensation to him for not conveying the two remaining bighas; or B may be directed, at the suit of A, to pay to A on receiving the conveyance and possession of the land, the stipulated purchase-money, less a sum awarded as compensation for the deficiency. (b) In a contract for the sale and purchase of a house and lands for two lakhs of rupees, it is agreed that part of the furniture should be taken at a valuation.The Court may direct specific performance of the contract notwithstanding the parties are unable to agree as to the valuation of the furniture, and may either have the furniture valued in the suit and include it in the decree for specific performance, or may confine its decree to the house.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 15--> Where a party to a Contract is unable to perform the whole of his part of it, and the part which must be left unperformed forms a considerable portion of the whole, or does not admit of compensation in money, he is not entitled to obtain a decree for specific performance.But the Court may, at the suit of the other party, direct the party in default to perform specifically so much of his part of the contract as he can perform, provided that the plaintiff relinquishes all claim to further performance, and all right to compensation, either for the deficiency, or for the loss or damage sustained by him through the default of the defendant. Illustrations (a) A contracts to sell to B a piece of land consisting of 100 bighas.It turns out that 50 bighas of the land belong to A, and the other 50 bighas to a stranger, who refuses to part with them.A cannot obtain a decree against B for the specific performance of the contract; but if B is willing to pay the price agreed upon, and to take the 50 bighas which belong to A, waiving all right to compensation either for the deficiency or for loss sustained by him through A's neglect or default, B is entitled to a decree directing A to convey those 50 bighas to him on payment of the purchase-money. (b) A contracts to sell to B an estate with a house and garden for a lakh of rupees.The garden is important for the enjoyment of the house.It turns out that A is unable to convey the garden.A cannot obtain a decree against B for the specific performance of the contract; but if B is willing to pay the price agreed upon, and to take the estate and house without the garden, waiving all right to compensation either for the deficiency or for loss sustained by him through A's neglect or default, B is entitled to a decree directing A to convey the house to him on payment of the purchase-money.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 16--> When a part of a contract which, taken by itself, can and ought to be specifically performed, stands on a separate and independent footing from another part of the same contract which cannot or ought not to be specifically performed, the Court may direct specific performance of the former part.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 17--> The Court shall not direct the specific performance of a part of a contract except in cases coming under one or other of the three last preceding sections.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 18--> Where a person contracts to sell or let certain property, having only an imperfect title thereto, the purchaser or lessee (except as otherwise provided by this Chapter) has the following rights:- (a) if the vendor or lessor has subsequently to the sale or lease acquired any interest in the property, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to make good the contract out of such interest; (b) where the concurrence of other persons is necessary to validate the title, and they are bound to convey at the vendor's or lessor's request, the purchaser or lessee may compel him to procure such concurrence; (c) where the vendor professes to sell unincumbered property, but the property is mortgaged for an amount not exceeding the purchase-money, and the vendor has in fact only a right to redeem it, the purchaser may compel him to redeem the mortgage and to obtain a conveyance from the mortgagee; (d) where the vendor or lessor sues for specific performance of the contract, and the suit is dismissed on the ground of his imperfect title, the defendant has a right to a return of his deposit (if any) with interest thereon, to his costs of the suit, and to a lien for such deposit, interest and costs on the interest of the vendor or lessor in the property agreed to be sold or let.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 19--> Any person suing for the specific performance of a contract, may also ask for compensation for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution for, such performance. If in any such suit the Court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted, but that there is a contract between the parties which has been broken by the defendant and that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall award him compensation accordingly. If in any such suit the Court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it is not sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for breach of the contract should also be made to the plaintiff, it shall award him such compensation accordingly. Compensation awarded under this section may be assessed in such manner as the Court may direct. Explanation.- The circumstance that the contract has become incapable of specific performance, does not preclude the Court from exercising the jurisdiction conferred by this section. Illustrations of the second paragraph- A contracts to sell a hundred maunds of rice to B.B brings a suit to compel A to perform the contract or to pay compensation.The Court is of opinion that A has made a valid contract and has broken it, without excuse, to the injury of B, but that specific performance is not the proper remedy.It shall award to B such compensation as it deems just. of the third paragraph- A contracts with B to sell him a house for Rs.1,000, the price to be paid and the possession given on the 1st January 1877.A fails to perform his part of the contract, and B brings his suit for specific performance and compensation, which is decided in his favour on the 1st January 1878.The decree may, besides ordering specific performance, award to B compensation for any loss which he has sustained by A's refusal. of the Explanation- A, a purchaser, sues B, his vendor, for specific performance of a contract for the sale of a patent.Before the hearing of the suit, the patent expires.The Court may award A compensation for the non-performance of the contract, and may, if necessary, amend the plaint for that purpose. A sues for the specific performance of a resolution passed by the Directors of a public company, under which he was entitled to have a certain number of shares allotted to him, and for compensation for the non-performance of the resolution.All the shares had been allotted before the institution of the suit.The Court may, under this section, award A compensation for the non-performance.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 20--> A contract, otherwise proper to be specially enforced, may be thus enforced, though a sum be named in it as the amount to be paid in case of its breach, and the party in default is willing to pay the same. Illustration A contracts to grant B an under-lease of property held by A under C, and that he will apply to C for a license necessary to the validity of the under-lease, and that, if the license is not procured, A will pay B Rs.10,000.A refuses to apply for the license and offers to pay B the Rs.10,000.B is nevertheless entitled to have the contract specifically enforced if C consents to give the license. (b) Contracts which cannot be specifically enforced
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 21--> The following contracts cannot be specifically enforced:- (a) a contract for the non-performance of which compensation in money is an adequate relief; (b) a contract which runs into such minute or numerous details, or which is so dependent on the personal qualifications or volition of the parties, or otherwise from its nature is such, that the Court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms; (c) a contract the terms of which the Court cannot find with reasonable certainty; (d) a contract which is in its nature revocable; (e) a contract made by trustees either in excess of their powers or in breach of their trust; (f) a contract made by or on behalf of a corporation or public company created for special purposes, or by the promoters of such company, which is in excess of its powers; (g) a contract the performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty extending over a longer period than three years from its date; (h) a contract of which a material part of the subject-matter, supposed by both parties to exist, has, before it has been made, ceased to exist. And, save as provided by the 1 Arbitration Act, 1940 (10 of 1940), no contract to refer 2 present or future differences to arbitration shall be specifically enforced; but if any person who has made such a contract 3 other than an arbitration agreement to which the provisions of the said Act apply and has refused to perform it, sues in respect of any subject which he has contracted to refer, the existence of such contract shall bar the suit. Illustrations to (a)- A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, a lakh of rupees in the four per cent.loan of the Central Government. A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, 40 chests of indigo at Rs.1,000 per chest: In consideration of certain property having been transferred by A to B, B contracts to open a credit in A's favour to the extent of Rs.10,000, and to honour A's drafts to that amount. The above contracts cannot be specifically enforced, for, in the first and the second both A and B, and in the third A, would be reimbursed by compensation in money. to (b)- A contracts to render personal service to B: A contracts to employ B on personal service: A, an author, contracts with B, a publisher, to complete a literary work. B cannot enforce specific performance of these contracts. A contracts to buy B's business at the amount of a valuation to be made by two valuers, one to be named by A and the other by B.A and B each name a valuer, but before the valuation is made, A instructs his valuer not to proceed: By a charter-party entered into in Calcutta between A, the owner of a ship, and B, the charterer, it is agreed that the ship shall proceed to Rangoon, and there load a cargo of rice, and thence proceed to London, freight to be paid, one-third on arrival at Rangoon, and two-thirds on delivery of the cargo in London: A lets land to B and B contracts to cultivate it in a particular manner for three years next after the date of the lease: A and B contract that, in consideration of annual advances to be made by A, B will for three years next after the date of the contract grow particular crops on the land in his possession and deliver them to A when cut and ready for delivery: A contracts with B that, in consideration of Rs.1,000 to be paid to him by B, he will paint a picture for B: A contracts with B to execute certain works which the Court cannot superintend: A contracts to supply B with all the goods of a certain class which B may require: A contracts with B to take from B a lease of a certain house for a specified term, at a specified rent, "if the drawing-room is handsomely decorated" , even if it is held to have so much certainty that compensation can be recovered for its breach: A contracts to marry B. The above contracts cannot be specifically enforced. to (c)- A, the owner of a refreshment-room, contracts with B to give him accommodation there for the sale of his goods and to furnish him with the necessary appliances.A refuses to perform his contract.The case is one for compensation and not for specific performance, the amount and nature of the accommodation and appliances being undefined. to (d)- A and B contract to become partners in a certain business, the contract not specifying the duration of the proposed partnership.This contract cannot be specifically performed, for, if it were so performed, either A or B might at once dissolve the partnership. to (e)- A is a trustee of land with power to lease it for seven years.He enters into a contract with B to grant a lease of the land for seven years, with a covenant to renew the lease at the expiry of the term.This contract cannot be specifically enforced. The Directors of a company have power to sell the concern with the sanction of a general meeting of the shareholders.They contract to sell it without any such sanction.This contract cannot be specifically enforced. Two trustees, A and B, empowered to sell trust-property worth a lakh of rupees, contract to sell it to C for Rs.30,000.The contract is so disadvantageous as to be a breach of trust.C cannot enforce its specific performance. The promoters of a company for working mines contract that the company when formed, shall purchase certain mineral property.They take no proper precautions to ascertain the value of such property-and in fact agree to pay an extravagant price therefor.They also stipulate that the vendors shall give them a bonus out of the purchase-money.This contract cannot be specifically enforced. to (f)- A company existing for the sole purpose of making and working a railway, contracts for the purchase of a piece of land for the purpose of erecting a cotton-mill thereon.This contract cannot be specifically enforced. to (g)- A contracts to let for twenty-one years to B the right to use such part of a certain railway made by A as was upon B's land, and that B should have a right of running carriages over the whole line on certain terms, and might require A to supply the necessary engine-power, and that A should during the term keep the whole railway in good repair.Specific performance of this contract must be refused to B. to (h)- A contracts to pay an annuity to B for the lives of C and D.It turns out that, at the date of the contract, C, though supposed by A and B to be alive, was dead.The contract cannot be specifically performed. (c) Of the discretion of the Court Substituted by Act 10 of 1940 , Section 49(2) and Schedule IV, for " Code of Civil Procedure and the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899 ". Substituted by Act 9 of 1899 , Section 21, for "a controversy Inserted by Act 10 of 1940 , Section 49(2) and Schedule IV.
Specific Relief Act, 1877_Section 22--> The jurisdiction to decree specific performance is discretionary, and the Court is not bound to grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so; but the discretion of the Court is not arbitrary but sound and reasonable, guided by judicial principles and capable of correction by a Court of appeal. The following are cases in which the Court may properly exercise a discretion not to decree specific performance:- I.Where the circumstances under which the contract is made are such as to give the plaintiff an unfair advantage over the defendant, though there may be no fraud or misrepresentation on the plaintiff's part. Illustrations (a) A, a tenant for life of certain property, assigns his interest therein to B.C contracts to buy, and B contracts to sell, that interest.Before the contract is completed, A receives a mortal injury from the effects of which he dies the day after the contract is executed.If B and C were equally ignorant or equally aware of the fact, B is entitled to specific performance of the contract.If B knew the fact, and C did not, specific performance of the contract should be refused to B. (b) A contracts to sell to B the interest of C in certain stock-in-trade.It is stipulated that the sale shall stand good, even though it should turn out that C's interest is worth nothing.In fact, the value of C's interest depends on the result of certain partnership-accounts, on which he is heavily in debt to his partners.This indebtedness is known to A, but not to B.Specific performance of the contract should be refused to A. (c) A contracts to sell, and B contracts to buy, certain land.To protect the land from floods, it is necessary for its owner to maintain an expensive embankment.B does not know of this circumstance, and A conceals it from him.Specific performance of the contract should be refused to A. (d) A's property is put up to auction.B requests C, A's attorney, to bid for him.C does this inadvertently and in good faith.The persons present, seeing the vendor's attorney bidding, think that he is a mere puffer and cease to compete.The lot is knocked down to B at a low price.Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B. II.Where the performance of the contract would involve some hardship on the defendant which he did not foresee, whereas its non-performance would involve no such hardship on the plaintiff. Illustrations (e) A is entitled to some land under his father's will on condition that if he sells it within twenty-five years, half the purchase-money shall go to B.A, forgetting the condition, contracts, before the expiration of the twenty-five years, to sell the land to C.Here the enforcement of the contract would operate so harshly on A, that the Court will not compel its specific performance in favour of C. (f) A and B, trustees, join their beneficiary, C, in a contract to sell the trust-estate to D, and personally agree to exonerate the estate from heavy incumbrances to which it is subject.The purchase-money is not nearly enough to discharge those incumbrances, though, at the date of the contract, the vendors believed it to be sufficient.Specific performance of the contract should he refused to D. (g) A, the owner of an estate, contracts to sell it to B, and stipulates that he, A, shall not be obliged to define its boundary.The estate really comprises a valuable property, not known to either to be part of it.Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B unless he waives his claim to the unknown property. (h) A contracts with B to sell him certain land to make a road to it from a certain railway-station.It is found afterwards that A cannot make the road without exposing himself to litigation.Specific performance of the part of the contract relating to the road should be refused to B, even though it may be held that he is entitled to specific performance of the rest with compensation for loss of the road. (i) A, a lessee of mines, contracts with B, his lessor, that at any time during the continuance of the lease B may give notice of his desire to take the machinery and plant used in and about the mines, and that he shall have the articles specified in his notice delivered to him at a valuation on the expiry of the lease.Such a contract might be most injurious to the lessee's business, and specific performance of it should be refused to B. (j) A contracts to buy certain land from B.The contract is silent as to access to the land.No right of way to it can be shown to exist.Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B. (k) A contracts with B to buy from B's manufactory and not elsewhere all the goods of a certain class used by A in his trade.The Court cannot compel B to supply the goods, but if he does not supply them, A may be ruined, unless he is allowed to buy them elsewhere.Specific performance of the contract should be refused to B. The following is a case in which the Court may properly exercise a discretion to decree specific performance:- III.Where the plaintiff has done substantial acts or suffered losses in consequence of a contract capable of specific performance.
