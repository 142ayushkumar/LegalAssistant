(12) Witnesses for the prosecution, whose attendance before the Court of Session or High Court is necessary and who appear before the Magistrate, shall execute before him bonds binding themselves to be in attendance when called upon by the Court of Session or High Court to give evidence.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898_Section 222--> State(s): Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal (1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom, or the thing (if any) in respect of which, it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. (2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed, without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of section 234: Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed one year.
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898_Section 223--> State(s): Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal When the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned in sections 221 and 222 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose. Illustrations (a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need not set out the manner in which the theft was effected. (b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A cheated B. (c) A is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place. The charge must set out that portion of the evidence given by A which is alleged to be false. (d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898_Section 225--> State(s): Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has occasioned a failure of justice. Illustrations (a) A is charged under section 242 of the Indian Penal Code, with " having been in possession of counterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit," the word " fraudulently " being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not be regarded as material. (b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge, or is set out incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material. (c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many transactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a material error. (d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haider Baksh. The Court may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial. (e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the '20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was material.
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898_Section 226--> State(s): Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal When any person is committed for trial without a charge, or with an imperfect or erroneous charge, the Court, or, in the case of a High Court, the 1 [Clerk of the State], may frame a charge or add to or otherwise alter the charge, as the case may be, having regard to the rules contained in this Code as to the form of charges.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898_Section 229--> State(s): Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal If the new or altered or added charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898_Section 230--> State(s): Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal If the offence stated in the new or altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction has been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the new or altered charge is founded.
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898_Section 231--> State(s): Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness who may have been examined, and also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898_Section 232--> State(s): Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal (1) If any Appellate Court, or the High Court in the exercise of its powers of revision or of its powers under Chapter XXVII, is of opinion that any person convicted of an offence was misled in his defence by the absence of a charge or by an error in the charge, it shall direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit. (2) If the Court is of opinion that the facts of the case are such that no valid charge could be preferred against the accused in respect of the facts proved, it shall quash the conviction. Illustration A is convicted of an offence, under section 196 of the Indian Penal Code, upon a charge which omits to state that he knew the evidence, which he corruptly used or attempted to use as true or genuine, was false or fabricated. If the Court thinks it probable that A had such knowledge, and that he was misled in his defence by the omission from the charge of the statement that he had it, it shall direct a new trial upon an amended charge; but, if it appears probable from the proceedings that A had no such knowledge, it shall quash the conviction.
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898_Section 233--> State(s): Delhi, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal For every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately, except in the cases mentioned in sections 234, 235, 236, and 239.
