Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section Preamble--> 
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 These instructions are supplemental to, and must be read in conjunction with the Central Excise Act, 1944 , and Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 (hereinafter referred to as the 'said Rules'). Only the general provisions and procedures applicable to the 'Manufactured Products' have been incorporated in this Manual. These instructions are applicable throughout India and should not be departed from, without the previous approval of the Commissioner, who will, where necessary, obtain Board's sanction for the deviations. 1.2 The Commissioner or Board, under Rule 32 of the said Rules are empowered to issue written instructions providing for any supplemental matters arising out of the said Rules. Such instructions may, where the Commissioner considers absolutely essential, permit temporary deviation from the standing instructions. However, such instructions should be at once communicated to the Board and unless of purely local interest, they will normally, if approved, be subsequently incorporated in this Manual. Additional/Joint Commissioners, Deputy/Assistant Commissioner and Superintendent of Central Excise will be primarily responsible in their jurisdiction for the proper observance of the procedures and checks prescribed in this Manual, and the other instructions of the Board. They should refer any doubtful point for clarification to their immediate superior.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Central Excise duty is an indirect tax levied on goods manufactured in India. The tax is administered by the Central Government under the authority of Entry 84 of the Union List (List 1) under Seventh Schedule read with Article 226 of the Constitution of India . 1.2. The Central Excise duty is levied in terms of the Central Excise Act, 1944 and the rates of duty, ad valorem or specific, are prescribed under the Schedule I and II of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985The taxable event under the Central Excise law is 'manufacture' and the liability of Central Excise duty arises as soon as the goods are manufactured. The Central Excise Officers are also entrusted to collect other types of duties levied under Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act , Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile Articles) Act , Cess etc. 1.3 Till 1969, there was physical control system wherein each clearance of manufactured from the factory was done under the supervision of the Central Excise Officers. Introduction of Self-Removal procedure was a watershed in the excise procedures. Now, the assessees were allowed to quantify the duty on the basis of approved classification list and the price list and clear the goods on payment of appropriate duty. 1.4 In 1994, the gate pass system gave way to the invoice-based system, and all clearances are now effected on manufacturer's own invoice. Another major change was brought about in 1996, when the Self-Assessment system was introduced. This system is continuing today also. The assessee himself assesses his Tax Return and the Department scrutinises it or conducts selective audit to ascertain correctness of the duty payment. Even the classification and value of the goods have to be merely declared by the assessee instead of obtaining approval of the same from the Department. 1.5 In 2000, the fortnightly payment of duty system was introduced for all commodities, an extension of the monthly payment of duty system introduced the previous year for Small Scale Industries. 1.6 In 2001, new Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 have replaced the Central Excise Rules, 1944 with effect from 1 st July, 2001. Other rules have also been notified namely, CENVAT Credit Rules, 2001 , Central Excise Appeal Rules, 2001 etc. With the introduction of the new rules several changes have been effected in the procedures. The new procedures are simplified. There are less numbers of rules, only 32 as compared to 234 earlier. Classification declaration and Price declarations have also been dispensed with, the CENVAT Declaration having been earlier dispensed with in 2000 itself.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 For the administration of the Central Excise Act, 1944 and the Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 (hereinafter referred to as the 'said Rules') manufacturers' of excisable goods or any person who deals with excisable goods, with some exceptions, are required to get the premises registered with the Central Excise Department before commencing business.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 In accordance with Rule 9 of the said Rules and Notifications issued under rules 18 and 19 of the said Rules, as the case may be, the following category of persons are required to register with jurisdictional Central Excise Officer in the Range office having jurisdiction over his place of business/factory - (i) Every manufacturer of excisable goods (including Central/State Government undertakings or undertakings owned or controlled by autonomous corporations) on which excise duty is leviable . (ii) Persons who desire to issue CENVATABLE invoices under the provisions of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2001 . (iii) Persons holding private warehouses. (iv) Persons who obtain excisable goods for availing end-use based exemption notification. (v) Exporters manufacturing or processing export goods by using duty paid inputs and intending to claim rebate of such duty or by using inputs received without payment of duty and exporting the finished export goods. 2.2 Separate registration is required in respect of separate premises except in cases where two or more premises are actually part of the same factory (where processes are interlinked), but are segregated by public road, canal or railway-line. The fact that the two premises are part of the same factory will be decided by the Commissioner of Central Excise based on factors, such as - (1) Interlinked process - product manufactured/produced in one premise are substantially used in other premises for manufacture of final products. (2) Large number of raw materials are common and received/proposed to be received commonly for both/all the premises (3) Common electricity supplies. (4) There is common labour /work force (5) Common administration/ works management. (6) Common sales tax registration and assessment (7) Common Income Tax assessment (8) Any other factor as may be indicative of inter-linkage of the manufacturing processes. This is neither an exhaustive list of indicators nor each indicator is necessarily in each case. The Commissioner has to decide the issued from case to case. 2.3 Separate Registration is required for each depot, godown etc. in respect of persons issuing Cenvat invoices. However, in the case liquid and gaseous products, availability of godown should not be insisted upon. 2.4 Registration Certificate may be granted to minors provided they have legal guardians i.e. natural guardians or guardians appointed by the Court, as the case may be, to conduct business on their behalf.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), by Notification No. 36/2001-CE (NT) dt.26.6.2001, has exempted specified categories of persons/premises from obtaining registration, as follows - (i) Persons who manufacture the excisable goods, which are chargeable to nil rate of excise duty or are fully exempt from duty by a notification. (ii) Small scale units availing the slab exemption based on value of clearances under a notification. However, such units will be required to give a declaration (Annexure-1)once the value of their clearances touches Rs.90 lakhs. (iii) In respect of ready-made garments, the job-worker need not get registered if the principal manufacturer undertakes to discharge the duty liability. (iv) Persons manufacturing excisable goods by following the warehousing procedure under the Customs Act, 1962 subject to the following conditions: (a) the said excisable goods and any intermediary or by-product including the waste and refuse arising during the process of manufacture of the said goods under the Customs Bond are either destroyed or exported out of the country to the satisfaction of the Assistant Commissioner of Customs or the Deputy Commissioner of Customs, in-charge of the Customs Bonded Warehouse; (b) the manufacturer shall file a declaration in the specified form annexed hereto in triplicate for claiming exemption under this notification; (c) no drawback or rebate of duty of excise paid on the raw materials or components used in the manufacture of the said goods, shall be admissible. (v) The person who carries on wholesale trade or deals in excisable goods (except first and second stage dealer, as defined in Cenvat Credit Rules, 2001 ). (vi) A Hundred per cent Export Oriented Undertaking, or a unit in Free Trade Zone or Special Economic Zone licensed or appointed, as the case may be, under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 . (vii) Persons who use excisable goods for any purpose other than for processing or manufacture of goods availing benefit of concessional duty exemption notification. 3.2 The Drugs and Cosmetics Rule 1945 recognises the concept of loan licence in the manufacture of P or P medicines. As a result the system of accepting the said concept is still prevalent under excise law. In such cases the procedure prescribed under Notification no.36/2001-CE (NT) dated 26/6/2001 has to be followed. The principal manufacturer who has under-taken to comply with the procedural formalities will have to maintain separate accounts in respect of goods manufactured on his own account and goods manufactured on behalf of the loan licensee. However, the principal manufacturer has to aggregate the clearances made by him together with clearances made on behalf of the loan licensees with regard to eligibility as well as exemption limit. In other words the clearances made on behalf of the loan licensee have to be clubbed with that of the principal manufacturer (by the manufacturer from one or more factories and from the factory by one or more manufacturers).
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 4--> 4.1 Under authority of Section 6 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 read with rule 9 of the said Rules, the CBEC has prescribed the format for Application as well as Registration Certificate. The application has to be made to the jurisdictional Central Excise Officer. 4.2 The application for registration should be signed by - (i) The applicant or by his authorised agent having general power of attorney. The Range Officer shall have power to call the original documents to verify 'power of attorney'. Such document shall not be retained by the Range Officer but be returned immediately after verification. (ii) In case of unregistered partnership firms, by all partners. (iii) In case of registered partnerships, by the managing partner or other partner so authorised in the Partnership Deed. 4.3 When a manufacturer who is exempt from the registration is required to file a declaration, the same will be filed with the Assistant Commissioner of the jurisdictional Central Excise Division.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 5--> 5.1 The manufacturers who are exempted from the operation of Rule 9 by virtue of Notification no. 36/2001-Central Excise (NT) dt.26/6/2001 have to file a declaration with the Assistant Commissioner of the respective Divisions. Such declarations received from the assessee will have to be filed separately, tariff head-wise in the Divisional office. The details should be entered in the register to be maintained in the Divisional office in the enclosed proforma. Genuine delay in filing the required declaration need not be viewed seriously and the assessee may be allowed to enjoy the exemption from the operation of Rule 9 as well as from the payment of duty provided the conditions stipulated in the respective exemption Notifications have been duly fulfilled.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 6--> 6.1 Under the section 6 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 read with rule 9 of the said Rules, the CBEC, by notification, has specified the format for Application as well as Registration Certificate (Annexure 2 and 3, respectively). The format of application is common to manufacturers, private warehouse holders, and registered dealers issuing CENVATABLE invoice and persons who obtain goods by availing end-use based exemptions, including manufacturers or processors of export goods. 6.2 In the application for Registration, the applicant has to submit ground plan. Under the Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 , there is no stipulation of any specified marked area for storing the finished goods (traditionally called the 'bonded store room'). Thus there is no need for marking such area in the ground plan. The only verification that the jurisdictional officers should conduct that the premises mentioned in the application for registration, are genuine and are intended for the purposes for which the application has been made. Assessee, however, shall be responsible for proper storage and accountal of goods manufactured in his factory at any point of time. 6.3 The verification shall be made by the Inspector or Superintendent of Central Excise having jurisdiction over the premises (Range Officer) in respect of which the applicant has sought registration, within 5 working days of the receipt of application. As per the rules/notification, the registration certificate shall be issued within 7 working days. The Range Officer (Superintendent) either himself or through the Sector Officer (Inspector) shall verify whether the declared address and operations (intended) are genuine and the declarations made in the application are correct. If found in order, he will endorse the correctness of the same and append his dated signature on the office copies of the Registration application and the copy of the application with the registrant. If any deviations or variations are noticed during the verification, the same should be got corrected. Any major discrepancy, such as fake address, non-existence of any factory etc. shall be reported in writing to the Divisional Officer within 3 working days and the Range Officer shall initiate action to safeguard revenue.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 7--> 7.1 All Registrations of each type should be numbered in a single series for the Range as a whole , commencing with serial no. 1 for each calendar year . The issuing authority should make every effort to complete all formalities and grant the Registration Certificate within 7 days of receipt of application in his office. Every Registration Certificate granted / issued by the registering authority shall be under his signature. He should also countersign the ground plan accompanying the Registration Certificate. The Registration Certificate and the duplicate copy of the plan should be returned to the registered person who shall exhibit his Registration Certificate or a certified copy thereof in a conspicuous part of the registered premises. The Registering authority in a permanent file shall keep the application as well as the ground plan. 7.2 In case of partnership firms, the Registration Certificate which is granted in the name of the said firm [which is registered or not under the Partnership Act] shall contain the names of all the partners. 7.3 The Registration Certificate or a certified copy thereof is required to be exhibited in a conspicuous part of the registered premises.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 8--> 8.1 Once Registration Certificate is granted, it has a permanent status unless it is suspended or revoked by the appropriate authority in accordance with law or is surrendered by the person or company concerned. If the person who applies for Registration with the department is an individual, then the Certificate would cease to be valid in the event of the death of the said individual. Any other person(s) who wish(es) to continue with the operations for which the deceased person was registered, he would then have to apply afresh. (See notification no. 35/2001-Central Excise (N.T.) dated 26th June, 2001.). 8.2 In the case of limited company, death of a director would not affect the status of Registration, since Registration is issued to the body corporate recognizing the same as a legal person. In the case of partnership firms also normally no difficulty would arise with regard to succession, since the surviving partners will continue either in the same name or with the change of name the business. However, in the case of proprietary business when the proprietor dies, the successor in estate has to apply for a fresh Registration. Ordinarily fresh Registration would be issued to the person who happens to be in the actual possession of the business. However, grant of fresh Registration to the successor in estate shall not be regarded that the Government has accepted the said person as the legal successor/heir to the deceased.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 9--> 9.1 Registration Certificate may be surrendered as per application in prescribed form in Notification No. 35/2001-CE (N.T.) dated 26.6.2001 [Annexure-4]. This is subject to compliance of the statutory obligations under the excise law, particularly the payment of all dues to the Government including the duty on finished excisable goods lying in the factory/warehouse. In case of mis-declaration regarding compliance, the surrender of registration shall not be valid. 9.2 Registration Certificate may be cancelled by the Registering authority when the registered person voluntarily surrenders the Certificate due to closure of business. 9.3 As per rule 17 of the said Rules Registration Certificate may be revoked or suspended by the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise, if the holder or any person under his employ has committed a breach of any condition of the Central Excise Act or the rules made thereunder or has been convicted of an offence under Section 161 read with Section 109 or Section 116 of the Indian Penal Code [45 of 1860]. 9.4 Suspension or revocation of the Registration is a heavy punishment since it amounts to suspending or stopping the business and could result in grave damage to the person concerned. Hence this penalty should be resorted to only in cases where there is persistent misdemeanor involving serious loss of revenue. 9.4 Though technically, a Registration Certificate can be suspended or revoked by the issuing authority, the power to revoke or suspend the Registration is vested only with the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner. In case of suspension or revocation, the Range Officer should refer the matter to the Deputy/Assistant commissioner who will pass appropriate orders after affording a reasonable opportunity. Appeal against this order lies with the Commissioner[Appeals] and this should be specifically spelt out in the order -in-original of the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner(Preamble).
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 10--> 10.1 When a Registration Certificate is reported to be lost, the registered person shall submit a written application to the Range Officer for issuing a DUPLICATE REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE. The same shall be issued after making necessary entries in the record or logs in the computer data. An importer who intends to issue invoice under Cenvat Credit Rules, 2001 , will have to Register himself in the manner specified earlier.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 The Central Excise assessees and registered dealers have to obtain New Excise Control Code Number [New ECC Number]. The Board had issued Circular No.493/59/99-CX 12th November, 1999 wherein the components of New ECC Number has been explained and the procedure to obtain the same has been specified. This Number is based on the principles of 'Common Business Identifier' and will ultimately replace the existing registration number. New ECC Number shall be used for revenue accounting, validation of documents (e.g. CENVAT invoices), inter-agency coordination and for creation of data warehouse. Hence, all persons requiring registration must obtain the New ECC Number. Currently, he said Number has to be quoted on the TR-6 Challans covering deposit of Central Excise duties, Additional duties, Cess and other dues to the Government.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 The new ECC number is alphanumeric. The first part is the 10-Character PAN issued by Income-tax authorities to the concerned person to whom the New ECC Number is to be allotted. The second part comprises of a fixed 2-Character alpha-code, which is as follows - Category Code (1) Central Excise manufacturers (Including registered warehouses) XM (2) Registered Dealers XD 2.2 This is followed by 3-Character numeric-code - 001, 002, 003.....etc. In case , a manufacturer, registered with the Central Excise Department, has only one factory /dealer's premise/warehouse, the last three characters will be "001". If there are more than one factories/warehouses/dealer's premises of such a person having common PAN for all such factories/warehouses/dealer's premises, the last 3 character of the new ECC would be "001, 002, 003.... etc. Examples: (1) Where the concerned person has only one factory: New ECC Number will be - PAN + XM + 001 Suppose PAN is ABCDE1234H, the New ECC Number will be - ABCDE1234H XM 001 (2) Where the concerned person has more than one factories, say 3 factories, having PAN as aforesaid, then the New ECC Number will be: ABCDE1234H XM 001 ABCDE1234H XM 002 ABCDE1234H XM 003 (3) Where the concerned person has one factory and is also registered as dealer, having PAN as aforesaid, then the New ECC Number will be: ABCDE1234H XM 001 (for Factory) ABCDE1234H XD 001 (for Dealer) 2.3 Since each factory have to apply for allotment of New ECC Number, a centralised allotment is done at the level of Division (where all the factories fall within the jurisdiction of the same Division) or at the level of Commissionerate (where all the factories fall within the jurisdiction of the same Commissionerate) or at the level of Director General of Inspection, Customs & Central Excise, New Delhi (where the factories fall within the jurisdiction of different Commissionerates). The same principle is applied to the allotment of New ECC Number to Dealers.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 Every person registered with Central Excise is required to obtain the New ECC Number. For obtaining the same the following procedure will be followed - (i) Application will be made in the prescribed form (in duplicate) given in Annexure-5 along with a certified copy of PAN (letter/card issued by the Income Tax Department), to the Jurisdictional Range Superintendent of Central Excise. (ii) A dated acknowledgement of the application will be given immediately by the Range Office. An entry will be made in a register (serially numbered) indicating name of the concerned person , address, Range and the existing ECC Number and date of forwarding of application, New ECC Number (to be filled when allotted). The Entry Number (Receipt Number) have to be endorsed on the Acknowledgement Slip. (iii) All applications are to be forwarded to Divisional Office. Where the applications are complete in all respects and there is only one factory of the PAN-holder or more than one factory within the jurisdiction of the said Division, New ECC Number is to be allotted within 3 working days and the letter has to be issued by the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner to the concerned persons (applicants) in the form given in Annexure-6. One copy of the letter has to be forwarded to the concerned Pay & Accounts Officer (PAO). (iv) Where there are more than one factories of the PAN-holder falling outside the jurisdiction of a Division, all such applications are to be forwarded to the Commissionerate Headquarters within 3 working days of the receipt of the application from the Range Office. (v) A Cell constituted in the Headquarters processes the application. Where all the factories fall within the jurisdiction of the Commissionerate, the New ECC Number is to be issued by the Commissionerate and is to be intimated to the concerned persons (applicants) individually in the format given in Annexure-III and a copy is forwarded to the concerned PAO. (vi) Where the factories of the PAN-holder fall in the jurisdiction of different Commissionerates, the applications are to be sent by the Commissioner to the Director General of Inspection, New Delhi within 3 working days of the receipt from the Division Office. DGI has also constituted a Special Cell to process such applications. The New ECC Number is to be allotted by DGI and intimated to the concerned persons in the format given in Annexure-4. A copy of these letters will also be forwarded to the concerned PAO. (vii) In the said application, the Location Code is to be filled in by the Range Office. After re-organisation of Commissionerates, the Directorate of Statistics & Intelligence has allocated revised location six digits Codes to all Range Offices. 3.2 It shall be compulsory for all the Central Excise assessees and dealers registered under the Central Excise Rules, 1944 to obtain PAN whether or not they pay Income-tax. The Income Tax Department has already been requested to allot PAN on priority basis to all Central Excise assessees and Registered Dealers.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 The expressions 'assessment' and 'assessee' have been defined in the Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 (hereinafter referred to as the said Rules). "Assessment" includes self-assessment of duty made by the assessee and provisional assessment under rule 7 of the said Rules. "Assessee" means any person who is liable for payment of duty assessed or a producer or manufacturer of excisable goods or a registered person of a private warehouse in which excisable goods are stored and includes an authorized agent of such person. 1.2 Normally, duty is payable on removal of goods. Rule 4 of the said Rules provides that every person who produces or manufactures any excisable goods, or who stores such goods in a warehouse, shall pay the duty leviable on such goods in the manner provided in rule 8 of the said Rules or under any other law. No excisable goods, on which any duty is payable, shall be removed without payment of duty from any place, where they are produced or manufactured, or from a warehouse, unless otherwise provided. 1.3 An exception has been provided in the said rule 4 in respect of goods falling under Chapter 62 of the First Schedule to Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986) produced or manufactured by a job worker. Such goods may be removed without payment of duty leviable thereon and the duty of excise leviable on such goods shall be paid by person who gets such goods, produced or manufactured on his account on job work as if such goods have been produced or manufactured by him, on the date of removal of such goods from his premises registered under rule 9. The payment of such duty may be secured by bond or otherwise. However, where such person has authorised the job worker to pay the duty leviable on such goods, the job worker shall pay such duty on the date of removal of such goods from his registered premises. 1.4 There is also an exception with respect to duty payment on molasses. Where molasses are produced in a khandsari sugar factory, the person who procures such molasses, whether directly from such factory or otherwise, for use in the manufacture of any commodity, whether or not excisable, shall pay the duty leviable on such molasses, in the same manner as if such molasses have been produced by the procurer. 1.5 For the purposes of the said rule 4, excisable goods manufactured in a factory and utilised, as such or after subjecting to any process, for the manufacture of any other commodity, in such factory shall be deemed to have been removed from such factory immediately before such utilisation.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 Before each removal, whether outside the factory of manufacture or production or for captive consumption, duty has to be assessed on the excisable goods. The main ingredients of assessment are: (i) Classification and rate of duty: For determining the rate of duty, classification is prerequisite. Classification means the appropriate classification code which is applicable to the excisable goods in question under the First Schedule to Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986). There are Section Notes and Chapter Notes, in the Tariff which are helpful in determining the appropriate classification. In case of difficulties, there are "Interpretative Rules" in the said Act. There is large number of judicial pronouncements concerning classification, which have to be applied in relevant case. The said Tariff also prescribes the 'Tariff Rate of duty'. Some commodities may be subject to 'special duty of excise' prescribed under the Second Schedule to Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985Thus, a reference to the Second Schedule to Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 should also be made to see if the goods are covered there. However, duty chargeable is the 'effective rate'. Thus, if any exemption is available to any commodity, the same may be ascertained and the applicable rate of duty should be determined. If such exemption is subject to certain conditions, it shall be necessary to follow those conditions. Certain goods may also be subject to duty under some other Acts such as Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act, 1957 or certain Cess. The manufacturer or owner of goods in a warehouse is liable to pay all such applicable duties on removal of excisable goods. (ii) Valuation: Where rate of duty is dependent on value of the goods ( ad valorem duty ), value has to be determined in accordance with the provisions of Central Excise Act, 1944 , as follows - (i) Value under section 4 including transaction value under this section (ii) Value based on retail sale price under section 4A. (iii) Tariff value fixed under Section 3. (iii) Quantity Removed: Where duty is on value, the total value is determined by multiplying unit value with the total quantity. The unit quantity of goods are also required in cases where duty is charged at specific rate.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 As per rule 6 of the said Rules a Central Excise assessee is himself (self-assessment) required to determine duty liability at the time of removal of excisable goods and discharge the same. In other words, the assessee should apply correct classification and value (where duty is ad valorem ) on the quantities being removed by him and indicate the same in the invoice (except assessee manufacturing cigarettes, in which case the Superintendent or Inspector of Central Excise has to assess the duty payable before removal by the assessee). 3.2 Assessee is also required to assess his return for a month and submit to the Range Office having jurisdiction over his factory within ten days of the succeeding month. They are also requited to submit 'CENVAT Return' for a month within five days of the succeeding month. A manufacturer availing exemption notification for Small Scale Industries is permitted to file his return of quarterly basis. Their returns have to be filed in the following frequency - Return for the quarter (for months) - By 20th day of the month First quarter - April, May, June - July Second quarter - July, August, September - October Third quarter -October, November, December - January Fourth quarter - January, February, March - April
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 4--> 4.1 Date for determination of rate of duty and tariff value is prescribed in rule 5 of the Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001The provision is, as follows - (1) The rate of duty or tariff value applicable to any excisable goods, other than khandsari molasses, shall be the rate or value in force on the date when such goods are removed from a factory or a warehouse, as the case may be. (2) The rate of duty in the case of khandsari molasses, shall be the rate in force on the date of receipt of such molasses in the factory of the procurer of such molasses. 4.2 If any excisable goods are used within the factory, 'the date of removal of such goods' shall mean the date on which the goods are issued for such use. 4.3 The rate of duty in the case of goods falling under Chapter 62 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986), produced or manufactured on job work, shall be the rate in force on the date of removal of such goods by the person referred to in sub-rule (3) of rule 4 from his premises registered under rule 9.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 The Central Excise duty is chargeable at the rates specified in the schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985The said schedule is divided into 20 sections and 96 Chapters. There are no Chapters with numbers 1,6,10,12 and 77. As such there are effectively 91 Chapters. Each Chapter is further divided into headings and sub-headings. In order to determine the applicable rate of duty in respect of a particular item, the positioning of that item under a particular head or sub-head is essential. The positioning of an item in the appropriate heading/sub-heading is called classification. The classification of an item is generally decided in view of how it is described in commercial parlance. However a deviation from this principle is made when the trade meaning or commercial nomenclature does not fit into the scheme of the statute.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1.The Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 incorporates five Rules of interpretation, which together provide necessary guidelines for classification of various products under the schedule. As regards the Interpretative Rules, the classification is to be first tested in the light of Rule 1. Only when it is not possible to resolve the issue by applying this Rule, recourse is taken to Rules 2,3 & 4 in seriatim. The provision of the individual Rule is as follows: (i) Rule 1 This rule provides that section and Chapter titles are only for the ease of reference and, therefore, do not have any legal bearing on the classification of goods, which is determined according to the terms of headings and relevant section or Chapter notes and according to the other interpretative rules if such headings or notes do not otherwise require. Thus goods are to be classified in terms of the heading and relative sections or Chapter notes without recourse to any interpretative rules. It is only when the goods cannot be classified on this basis, the assistance is to be sought from the interpretative rules. (ii) Rule 2(a) This rule provides classification of an article referred to in a heading, even if that article is incomplete or unfinished, or is presented in an unassembled or disassembled form. An important condition to be satisfied for classification in this manner is that in its incomplete or unfinished state, the article has the essential character of the complete of finished article. Some of the important aspects which are relevant in this regard are functional aspect, physical aspect and the degree of completion of the product. (iii) Rule 2(b) This rule relates to mixture or combination of materials or substances, and goods consisting of two or more materials or substances. According to this rule headings in which there is a reference to a material or substance also apply to that material or substance mixed or combined with other materials or substances. This rule does not apply where specific provisions exist in the headings or the sections or chapter notes excluding such classification. (iv) Rule 3 This rule lays down three steps for classifying the goods which are, prima facie, classifiable under several headings. The sequential order of the steps contemplated are - (a) most specific description; (b) essential character; and heading which occurs last in numerical order; This rule applies when goods are prima facie classifiable under 2 or more headings. In the first step, {Rule 3(a)} the general guidelines are that a description by name is more specific than the description by character and a description which identifies the goods clearly and precisely is more specific than the one which is less complete. The second step [Rule 3 (b)] relates only to mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or components and goods put up in sets. This rule finds applicability if rule 3(a) does not help. In all such cases the goods are to be classified as if they consist of material or components which gives them their essential character. When goods cannot be classified with reference to Rules 3(a) and 3(b), they are to be classified in terms of Rule 3(c)- in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration. This is a fall back provision for resolving the matter when no heading can be regarded as providing a more specific description than the others and when it is not possible to identify the material or component which gives the concerned goods their essential character. (v) Rule 4 When goods cannot be classified in accordance with rules 1,2, & 3, then they are to be classified in a heading of a product, which is most akin to the goods in question. Kinship can, of course, depend on many factors such as description, character, purpose etc. (vi) Rule 5 This rule postulates that the classification of any product under a sub-heading is to be contemplated after the product concerned has been properly classified under its proper four digit Chapter heading. The classification in the sub-heading of a heading is determined mutatis mutandis in accordance with the principles applicable to classification in the four digit headings.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 Section 37B of the Central Excise Act, 1944 empowers the Central Board of Excise & Customs to issue orders, instructions and directions, for the purpose of uniformity in the classification of goods or with respect to the levy of excise duties on such goods.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Value of the excisable goods has to be necessarily determined when the rate of duty is on ad-valorem basis. Accordingly, under the Central Excise Act, 1944 the following values are relevant for assessment of duty. Transaction value is the most commonly adopted method- (i) Transaction value under Section 4. (ii) Value determined on basis of maximum Retail Sale Price as per Section 4A. (iii) Tariff value under Section 3.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 Section 4 of the Central Excise Act , as substituted by section 94 of the Finance Act, 2000 (No.10 of 2000),has come into force from the 1st day of July 2000. This section contains the provision for determining the Transaction value of the goods for purpose of assessment of duty. 2.2 For applicability of transaction value in a given case, for assessment purposes, certain essential requirements should be satisfied. If any one of the said requirement is not satisfied, then the transaction value shall not be the assessable value and value in such case has to be arrived at under the valuation rules notified for the purpose. The essential ingredients of a Transaction value are - (i) The goods are sold by an assessee for delivery at the time of place of removal. The term "place of removal" has been defined basically to mean a factory or a warehouse; (ii) The assessee and the buyer of the goods are not related; and (iii) The price is the sole consideration for the sale. 2.3 The definition of "transaction value" needs to be carefully taken note of as there is fundamental departure from the erstwhile system of valuation that was essentially based on the concept of 'Normal Wholesale Price', even though sales were effected at varying prices to different buyers or class of buyers from factory gate or Depots etc. had to be determined. 2.4 The new section 4 essentially seeks to accept different transaction values which may be charged by the assessee to different customers, for assessment purposes so long as these are based upon purely commercial consideration where buyer and the seller have no relationship and price is the sole consideration for sale. Thus, it enables valuation of goods for excise purposes on value charged as per commercial practices rather than looking for a notionally determined value. 2.5 Transaction value would include any amount which is paid or payable by the buyer to or on behalf of the assessee, on account of the factum of sale of goods. In other words, if, for example, an assessee recovers advertising charges or publicity charges from his buyers, either at the time of sale of goods or even subsequently, the assessee cannot claim that such charges are not to be included in the transaction value. The law recognizes such payment to be part of the transaction value that is assessable value for those particular transactions. Certain other elements which are included in the Transaction value are, as follows - (i) Receipts/recoveries or charges incurred or expenses provided for in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, selling of the excisable goods. In other words, whatever elements which enrich the value of the goods before their marketing and were held by Hon'ble Supreme court to be includible in "value" under the erstwhile section 4 would continue to form part of section 4 value even under new section 4 definition. (ii) If in addition to the amount charged as price from the buyer, the assessee recovers any other amount by reason of sale or in connection with sale, then such amount shall also form part of the transaction value. For example if assessee splits up his pricing system and charges a price for the goods and separately charges for packaging or warranty, the packaging charges will also form part of assessable value as it is a charge in connection with production and sale of the goods recovered from the buyer. In this context, it may be clarified that it is immaterial whether the warranty is optional or mandatory. Since the value can be different for different transactions, wherever warranty charges are paid or payable to the assessee, in those transactions warranty charges shall form part of the assessable value. In those transactions where warranty charges are not recovered, the question of including warranty charges in transaction value does not arise. (iii) Interest for delayed payments are a normal practice in industry. Interest under a financing arrangement entered between the assessee and the buyer relating to the purchase of excisable goods shall not be regarded as part of the assessable value provided that: (a) the interest charges are clearly distinguished from the price actually paid or payable for the goods; (b) the financing arrangement is made in writing; and (c) where required, assessee demonstrates that such goods are actually sold at the price declared as the price actually paid or payable. (iv) Discount of any type or description given on any normal price payable for any transaction will not form part of the transaction value for the goods, e.g. quantity discount for goods purchased or cash discount for the prompt payment etc. will therefore not form part of the transaction value. However, it is important to establish that the discount has actually been passed on to the buyer of the goods. The differential discounts extended as per commercial considerations on different transactions to unrelated buyers if extended can not be objected to and different actual prices paid or payable for various transactions are to be accepted. Where the assessee claims that the discount of any description for a transaction is not readily known but would be known only subsequently - as for example, year end discount - the assessment for such transactions may be made on a provisional basis. However, the assessee has to disclose the intention of allowing such discount to the department and make a request for provisional assessment. (v) The definition of transaction value mentions that whatever amount is actually paid or actually payable to the Government or the relevant statutory authority by way of excise, sale tax and other taxes, such amount shall be excluded from the transaction value. In other words, if any excise duty or other tax is paid at a concessional rate for a particular transaction, the amount of excise duty or tax actually paid at the concessional rate shall only be allowed to be deducted from price. (vi) As per commercial practice, the price for the goods charged, normally includes the cost of packing charges. However, at times separate charge may be billed for special packing, as per customer's requirements. Whereas in the context of erstwhile section 4 certain disputes often arose whether certain packing in relation to particular goods is secondary or primary and whether its value is to be added for assessment purposes, under the new section 4, such issues are no longer relevant. Any charges recovered for packing are obviously charges recovered in relation to the sale of the goods under assessment and will form part of the transaction value of the goods. In short, it is immaterial whether packing is ordinary or special. Whatever amount is charged from the buyer for packing and if not already included by the assessee in the price payable for the goods will be included while determining the transaction value of the goods. 2.6 Where the assessee includes all their costs incurred in relation to manufacture and marketing while fixing price payable for the goods and bills and collects an all inclusive price -as happens in most cases where sales are to independent customers on commercial consideration - the transaction price will generally be the assessable value. Nevertheless, there could be situations where the amount charged by an assessee does not reflect the true intrinsic value of goods marketed and total value split up into various elements like special packing charges, warranty charges, service charges etc. These cases would require to be scrutinised carefully to ensure that duty is paid on correct value. The definition of "transaction value" makes it clear that all the elements of cost which the assessee incurred till the sale/marketing as aforesaid, continue to be included in the assessable value even under new section 4. 2.7 The term "place of removal" has been defined in the same manner as was defined in the erstwhile section 4 prior to its amendment in 1996. If, therefore, the transaction value is with reference to delivery at the time and place of removal, such transaction value will be the assessable value.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 In those cases where any of the three requirements mentioned in para 2 above is missing, the assessable value shall be determined on the basis of the Central Excise Valuation (Determination of Price of Excisable Goods) Rules, 2001 notified under Section 4(1)(b) by notification No. 45/2000-CE (NT), dated 30.6.2000. 3.2 Salient features of the new valuation rules are mentioned below- (i) If the assessee and the buyer are not related persons and the price is also the sole consideration for sale but only the delivery of goods is made by the assessee at a place other than the factory/warehouse, then the assessable value shall be the "transaction value" without the addition of the cost of transportation from the factory/warehouse upto the place of delivery. However, exclusion of cost of transportation is allowed only if the assessee has shown them separately in the invoice and the exclusion is permissible only for the actual cost so charged from his buyers. If the assessee has a system of pricing and sale at uniform prices inclusive of equated freight for delivery at factory gate or elsewhere, no deductions for freight element will be permissible. (ii) If the goods are not sold at the factory gate or at the warehouse but they are transferred by the assessee to his depots or consignment agents or any other place for sale, the assessable value in such case for the goods cleared from factory/warehouse shall be the normal transaction value of such goods at the depot, etc. at or about the same time on which the goods as being valued are removed from the factory or warehouse. It may be pertinent to take note of the definition of "normal transaction value" as given in the valuation rules. What it basically means is the transaction value at which the greatest aggregate quantity of goods from the depots etc. are sold at or about the time of removal of the goods being from the factory/warehouse. If, however, the identical goods are not sold by the assessee from depot/consignment agent's place on the date of removal from the factory/warehouse, the nearest date on which such goods were sold or would be sold shall be taken into account. In either case if there are series of sales at or about the same time, the normal transaction value for sale to independent buyers will have to be determined and taken as basis for valuation of goods at the time of removal from factory/warehouse. It follows from the Valuation Rules that in such categories of cases also if the price charges is with reference to delivery at a place other than the depot, etc. then the actual cost of transportation will not be taken to be a part of the transaction value and exclusion of such cost allowed on similar lines as discussed earlier, when sales are effected from factory gate/warehouse. (iii) As a measure of simplification, it has been decided to value goods which are captively consumed on cost construction method only as there have been disputes in adopting values of comparable goods. The assessable value of captively consumed goods will be taken at 115% of the cost of manufacture of goods even if identical or comparable goods are manufactured and sold by the same assessee. The concept of deemed profit for notional purposes has thus been done away with and a margin of 15% by way of profit etc. is prescribed in the rule itself for ease of assessment of goods used for captive consumption. (iv) In the case where price is not the sole consideration for the sale, but the other requirements of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 4 of the Central Excise Act are satisfied, the value shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of rule 6 of the valuation rules. This provides for adding, to the transaction value the money value of any additional consideration flowing directly or indirectly from the buyer to the assessee. Such additional consideration would include the money value of goods and services provided free or at reduced cost by or on behalf of the buyer to the assessee. An Explanation has been added in the new rule only to remove any doubts with respect to its scope. (v) Where goods are sold through related persons, the transaction value is not applicable. The definition of related persons includes "inter-connected undertakings" as defined in the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969The definition of inter-connected undertaking in the said Act is comprehensive and includes two or more under-takings which are inter-connected with each other in any of a number of ways such as if one owns or controls the other, or where the undertakings are owned by firm, or if such firms have one or more common partners, etc. A provision has been made in the Valuation Rules that even if the assessee and the buyer are 'inter-connected undertakings', the transaction value will be "rejected" only when they are "related" in the following manner: (a) They are relatives. (b) The buyer is a relative and a distributor of the assessee, or sub-distributor of such distributor. (c) They have a direct or indirect interest in the business of each other. In other cases, they will not be considered related. "Transaction value" could then form the basis of valuation provided other two conditions, namely, price is for delivery at the time and place of removal and the price is the sole consideration for sale are satisfied. If any of the two aforesaid conditions are not satisfied then, quite obviously, value in such cases will be determined under the relevant rule.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 4--> 4.1 The practice being followed is to assess the price administered petroleum products like motor spirit, HSD, SKO (domestic) and LPG to duty on the ex-storage sale prices that are fixed by the Oil Coordination Committee (OCC) from time to time. The assessable value is the same irrespective of whether the administered petroleum products are sold at the refineries or through the marketing companies.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 5--> 5.1 For certain items the Government may fix a tariff value as per provisions of Section 3(3) of the Central Excise Act, 1944In such cases the assessment of duty shall be on the basis of the tariff value.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 6--> 6.1 The value is based on maximum retail sale price in terms of Section 4A of the Central Excise Act, 1944This is applicable to notified commodities. The notification issued in this regard indicates the extent of abatement to be allowed for arriving at the assessable value for determination of amount of duty.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Provisional assessment is resorted to in the event the duty can not be determined at the point of clearance of the goods.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 Wherever an assessee finds that final assessment is not possible, (in situations mentioned in rule 7 of the Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 (hereinafter referred to as the said Rules) he will make a detailed request in writing to the Divisional Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise, indicating - (a) Specific grounds/reasons, and the documents or information's, for want of which final assessment cannot be made. (b) Period for which provisional assessment is required. (c) The rate of duty or the value or both, as the case may be, proposed to be applied by the assessee, for Provisional Assessment. (d) Undertakes to appear before the Assistant/Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise within 7 days or such date fixed by him, and furnish all relevant information and documents within the time specified by the Assistant/Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise in his order, so as to enable the proper officer to finalise the provisional assessment. 2.2 On receipt of the request, the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise will examine it, if necessary, in consultation with the concerned Range Officer, to ascertain whether provisional assessment is necessary at all. If the reasons/ grounds are not sufficient, he may ask the assessee to appear before him on an appointed day and time, and if he is satisfied that provisional assessment is not necessary, he may pass a reasoned order rejecting the same and also ordering the rate of duty or the value, to be applied by the assessee. 2.3 Where the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise is satisfied with the genuineness of the assessee's request he will issue a specific order directing provisional assessment clearly stating - (a) The grounds on which Provisional Assessment has been ordered. (b) The rate and /or value, as the case may be, at which duty has to be provisionally paid. (c) The amount of differential duty for which bond is to be executed covering the period, if any, during which assessee paid duty provisionally under the deeming provisions, after applying the rate and/ or value specified in (b) above. (d) The amount of security or surety as may be fixed by Assistant Commissioner keeping in view the instructions issued by the Board from time to time. 2.4 The assessee is required to mark the E.R.1 (monthly/quarterly return)and documents covered under Provisional Assessment as "PROVISIONALLY ASSESSED" vide Order No. ......... dated .............." . There is a declaration in E.R.1 where assessee have to mention the goods under 'provisional assessment'. 2.5 Notwithstanding 'self-assessment', all cases of provisional assessment has to be finalised by the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise, within a maximum period of 6 months. All the cases where provisional assessment cannot be finalised within 6 months must be submitted to Commissioner with the request letter of the assessee (through Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise) indicating the reasons for non-finalisation and amount of differential duty for future clearances, before the expiry of the above-said period. If the Commissioner is satisfied with the reasons, he may extend the period, or otherwise direct the method to be adopted for finalisation of the assessment. For extending the period beyond one year from the date of provisional assessment, the request letter of the assessee should be put up to the Chief Commissioner in the same manner through Commissioner with his comments. The time limit of finalising the provisional assessment shall be applicable even to cases ordered for provisional assessment prior to 1 st July, 2001. 2.6 Finalisation of provisional assessment means finalisation of an issue/ground and thereafter finalisation of each E.R.1s. The amount will be communicated to the assessee at the earliest. The amount of each differential duty shall be paid along with interest at the rate of twenty four percent per annum from the first day of the month succeeding the month for which such amount is determined, till the date of payment thereof. 2.7 In the event the assessee will be in a position to ascertain the duty himself. He may, pay the duty on his own at the earliest and in that case he will not have to incur interest on account of time taken by the Department to finalise assessment and communicate the amount. 2.8 Where any refund becomes due to the assessee, order shall be passed for such refund, but disbursement shall be subject to further verification about incidence of such duty. The assessee will be required to submit proof to the Assistant/deputy Commissioner of Central Excise that the duty incidence was borne by him (assessee). If the assessee fails to produce such proof/evidence, the Assistant/deputy Commissioner of Central Excise will pass an order for depositing the amount in Consumer Welfare Fund in the prescribed manner. Otherwise, the refund shall be give along with interest at the rate of fifteen percent per annum from the first day of the month succeeding the month for which such refund is determined, till the date of refund. 2.9 Though it is incumbent upon the assessee to ensure that the bond amount and corresponding securities are sufficient, the Divisional as well as the Range Officer will also keep a strict vigil on such cases with the help of 'Provisional Assessment Register'. 2.10 The Assistant/deputy Commissioner of Central Excise will be held responsible to ensure that bonds for proper amount i.e., 3 times of the estimated differential duty are taken, in case of general bonds and that these are backed by proper (25%) security/ bank guarantee of the bond amount. 2.11 The format of bond for provisional assessment has been specified in Notification No. 56/2001-Central Excise (N.T.) dated 3.7.2001 (Annexure-7).
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 Rule 7 of the said Rules does not provide for the Department, suo moto, issuing directions for resorting to provisional assessment. Therefore, when the Central Excise Officers, during scrutiny or otherwise, find that self-assessment in not in order the assessee may be asked for all necessary document, records or other information for issue of duty demand for differential duty, if any, after conducting inquiry. Where the assessee fails to provide the records or information and Department is unable to issue demand, 'Best Judgment' method may be used to raise demand based on collateral evidences. The burden will be on the assessee to provide information for appropriate re-determination of duty, if any.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 4--> 4.1 The provisions of Provisional Assessment relating to interest clause and statutory time limit are prospective. In other words, these provisions shall be applicable only to those cases of provisional assessment, which are ordered on or after 1st July, 2001.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Rule 8 of the said Rules provides that duty relating to removals during a fortnight of a month can be discharged within five days of the close of that fortnight, except that in the last fortnight of the month of March, the duty has to be discharged by the last day of the month. In case of a manufacturer availing an exemption based on value of clearances during a financial year, the duty for a month may be discharged by fifteenth day of the succeeding month. 1.2 An assessee may also exercise the option of payment of duty consignment-wise. 1.3 There is no specific provision in the new Rules for clearance of goods without payment of duty for storage outside the factory. However, considering that there may be genuine difficulties for sugar industry i.e. sugar has season production , but its off take is through out the year, and that large quantity of the off take (sale) sugar is controlled by government [levy sugar], the manufacturer may not be in a position to clear the goods on payment of duty. Storage of such huge quantities within the factory will be burdensome. Accordingly, it has been decided to allow storage of non-duty paid sugar outside the factory, under such bond and securities/sureties and such conditions and limitations as the Commissioner may specify for a manufacturer on case to case basis. 1.4 The duty can be discharged by debiting an account current (also referred to as Personal Ledger Account [PLA]) and debiting the CENVAT Credit Account maintained by the assessee under the provisions of CENVAT Credit Rules, 2001 . 1.5 No format for CENVAT Credit Account has been specified. The assessee has to maintain this account in his own format. This account is a credit-debit account wherein the admissible credit in respect of inputs and capital goods received by the assessee in his factory is taken and debit is made for payment of any duty. 1.5 In account current [Personal Ledger Account], credit is taken by depositing money in the banks on T.R.6 Challans. The guidelines regarding account current are mentioned in subsequent paragraphs.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 In order to open a new Personal Ledger Account, the manufacturer, quoting his registration number, shall obtain the New Excise Control Code Number (New ECC Number), which is a Permanent Account Number (PAN)-based number. Once Department adopts 'common number' for registration and accounts, separate ECC number shall not be required. 2.2 The manufacturer working under the procedure shall maintain an account current (Personal Ledger Account) in the Form specified in Annexure-8. 2.3 Each credit and debit entry should be made on separate lines and assigned a running serial number for the financial year. 2.4 The PLA must be prepared in triplicate by writing with indelible pencil and using double-sided carbon - original and duplicate copies of the PLA should be detached by the manufacturers and sent to the Central Excise Officer in charge along with the monthly/quarterly periodical return in form E.R.1.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 The assessee may make credit in the PLA by making cash payment into the Treasury/or Authorised Bank. If allowed by the Commissioner, In exceptional cases, such as sudden strike in bank, natural calamity, riot etc., after sending by Registered A.D. post or by a messenger a cheque for the requisite amount to the Chief Accounts Officer of the Commissionerate, provided procedure specified in this regard are followed. 3.2 Deposit into the Treasury of the authorised bank should be made in a Challan in form TR 6 under the correct Head of Account. The Assessee's ECC No. should also be indicated in the challans. A copy of each Treasury Challan bearing Treasury/Bank seal and the signature of the authorised officer of the Treasury/Bank which is received back from the Treasury/Bank in token of having made the deposit, should be sent by the assessee to the Central Excise Office along with the monthly periodical return in form E.R.1/E.R.2. 3.3 There is an 'Explanation' to sub-rule (1) of rule 5 that the duty liability shall be deemed to have been discharged only if the amount payable is credited to the account of the Central Government by the specified date. It is being interpreted that it refers to deposit of duty amount by the focal point banks into the account of Government. This is not the intention. Once the assessee has deposited a cheque in bank and the same is honoured or pays in cash/drafts and the bank gives receipt stamp on TR-6 Challans, the same shall be treated as 'credited to the account of the Central Government' 3.4 No restriction exists with regard to any minimum amount, which should necessarily remain in balance to the credit of an assessee in his PLA. With the fortnightly/monthly payment system, there should be enough credit at the time of payment of duty for the fortnight. 3.5 Where an assessee is required/chooses to pay duty consignment wise (for the reasons of defaults earlier) - (i) Duty on each clearance should be paid by the assessee by making debit entry in the PLA prior to the removal of the goods outside the factory premises or for being taken into use inside the factory premises. If any goods are removed from the factory without such debit entry they will be treated as non-duty paid. (ii) Duty on clearances of any excisable goods as samples in such small quantities as the Commissioner may approve in respect of any commodity may be paid on the last working day of the month by a single debit in the account current. 3.6 Mutilations or erasures of entries once made in the PLA are not allowed. If any correction becomes necessary, the original entry should be neatly scored out and attested by the assessee or his authorised agent.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 4--> 4.1 In case where miscellaneous dues like rents, fines or penalties are to be paid by the holder of account current he may be advised to make payments of such accounts directly into the authorised bank under Challan in form T R 6 supported by order of demand, if any. Such challans need not be counter-signed by the Departmental Officer but should indicate the particulars of penalties, rent etc, deposited. If, however, the account holder desires that such miscellaneous dues should also be paid through an account current, he may be permitted to open a separate account current for this purpose under the group minor head "E-Miscellaneous-1 Miscellaneous".
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 5--> 5.1 Regarding the Account Code Directory for the purpose of computerisation, separate instructions have been issued by the Principal Chief Controller of Accounts C.B.E.C., which may be referred to.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 6--> 6.1 This procedure is to be followed only when all the banks nominated to collect revenues within a Commissionerate are unable to transact business, due to strike of banks or sudden closure of banks due to riots, imposition of curfew or natural calamities such as flood, cyclones, etc. 6.2 Normally in all cases of closure of bank business due to strike by bank employees, the Public gets advance intimation either through the press, or otherwise. In all such cases, the assessees should make advance arrangements to deposit money into the banks and keep sufficient amounts in their account current [PLA] so that they do not face any difficulty in the clearance of the goods during the period of the strike. 6.3 In cases, where the strike of bank employees is without notice, or where the strike called for after due notice is prolonged beyond a reasonable time (say over 3-4 days) or where there is sudden closure of banks due to riots, imposition of curfew or natural calamities such as flood, cyclones, etc., the Commissioner may adopt the procedure specified hereinafter in partial relaxation of the provisions contained in the "Manual for collection of Revenue and payment of refunds etc.(hereinafter referred to as 'Manual')" only for the duration of the strike or the sudden closures: - 6.4 The Commissioners should issue a Trade Notice stating that during the days of the closure of bank business due to such strikes (specifying the dates wherever possible), the assessees can send their cheques by registered post, acknowledgement due (R.P.A.D.) or special messenger, with the TR-6 challans (in quadruplicate) duly filled in, to the Chief Accounts Officers of the Commissionerates, with a clear declaration that they have sufficient balance in their bank account - (i) They should be advised to send a copy of the letter forwarding the cheque, to the concerned Range Officer also. (ii) On the strength of a cheque so sent, they may take credit in the P.L.As. (iii) On receipt of the cheque in his office, the Chief Accounts Officer will immediately intimate the concerned Range Officer about the name of the assessee, the number and date of the cheque and its amount. (iv) Immediately after the strike is over, all such cheques should be deposited by the Chief Accounts Officer into the Focal Point Bank/State Bank of India at the Headquarters or Reserve Bank of India, as the case may be, through TR-6 challans (in quadruplicate) according to the procedure prescribed in the Manual. (v) The Chief Accounts Officer will send the Duplicate/Triplicate copies of the receipted challans to the assessees and the quadruplicate copy to the R.Os. concerned to enable them to exercise necessary checks and prepare the monthly statement of revenue. (vi) Bank commission or collection charges, if any, chargeable by the banks should be debited in the P.L.A of the assessees by the Chief Accounts Officer under intimation to them as also the R.Os. (vii) If any of the cheques sent by the assessees are dishonoured, the Commissioners shall take appropriate penal action as prescribed under the rules. (viii) The Chief Accounts Officer should maintain a suitable record in regard to receipt and disposal of such cheques.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 7--> 7.1 For removal of doubts and to ensure uniformity of application of the procedure it is clarified that the payment of duty/other dues through cheques should not be permitted in the following cases- (i) If there is a strike in or closures of only one nominated bank of the Commissionerate and the assessee still remains in a position to deposit money in the other nominated banks or Departmental Treasury (wherever they exist) - unless the assessees' bank is the only nominated bank in the Commissionerate. (ii) In the case of declared Bank holidays because such holidays are known well in advance. (iii) Where the Public has been given advance intimation of a strike, unless the strike is unduly prolonged (say over 3-4 days). (iv) Where Bank employees adopt "go-slow" tactics.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 In view of the self-assessment procedure wherein the assessee himself assesses the duty liability the responsibility of the departmental officers is to scrutinise the assessment made for verification of its correctness.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 The Central Excise Officers having jurisdiction over the factory/premises of the assessee is responsible for the scrutiny of returns. For this purpose, the said officer(s) may require the relevant documents. Though the statutory records have been dispensed with, the assessee is required to maintain private records containing all requisite information as required by different rules and also provide a list of all records maintained by him to the Range Office. The Officer responsible for scrutiny of return may require the invoices issued by the assessee, Daily Stock Account, Cenvat Account, cash ledgers, Ledger of all receipts and payments and the source documents etc. It shall be compulsory for the assessee to provide the necessary records upon receiving the "Requisition Letter' from the Range Officer or other superior officers. He shall hand over the records under proper acknowledgement and receive them back under proper acknowledgement too. The Officer scrutinizing return may require presence of the assessee or his authorised person at mutually convenient time, for seeking certain information relating to the records. 2.2 The Superintendent of Central Excise in-charge of the Range Office, with assistance of the Inspectors in-charge of the factory of an assessee, will scrutinise all the returns. They shall, in selected cases, call all connecting documents including invoices and the records and scrutinise the correctness of assessment. 2.3 The Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise will scrutinise the returns of the units, which pay duty-exceeding rupees one crore but less than Rs.5 crores from PLA per annum every six months. They shall requisition all connecting documents including invoices and the records and scrutinise the correctness of assessment. 2.4 The Additional/Joint Commissioner of Central Excise will scrutinise the returns of the units which pay duty Rs. 5 crores or more from PLA per annum every six months. They shall requisition all connecting documents including invoices and the records and scrutinise the correctness of assessment.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 An invoice is the document under cover of which the excisable goods are to be cleared by the manufacturer.

Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 Once the SSI exemption limit of Rs. 100 lakhs is crossed and assessee starts paying duty, he is eligible to take CENVAT credit in respect of inputs lying in stock, on the inputs contained in finished goods lying in stock and on the inputs in process. For this purpose, it is obligatory on the assessee to quantify the amount of admissible credit on the basis of documentary evidence and records maintained for this purpose. 3.2 The CENVAT credit can be utilised for payment of duty on waste and scrap as waste and scrap are 'final products' within the definition given in the Credit Rules. 3.3 Raw material used for making packing material CENVAT credit is permissible on the ' raw material' so used. This is for the reason that the packing material being and input, the raw material used for making packing material is also to be construed as inputs used in or in relation to the manufacture of finished products. 3.4 There is no bar for a manufacturer to remove the inputs or capital goods as such for export under bond. 3.5 Manufacturer is entitled to take the CENVAT credit in a situation where capital goods were received before 1-4-2000 and also installed before that date but MODVAT/CENVAT was not taken due to some reason prior to 1-4-2000 because even though the modvat credit was not taken by the manufacturer, the modvat credit had been "earned" by him. 3.6 CENVAT credit is required to be taken immediately on receipt of inputs in the factory. This, however, does not mean, nor is it even intended that if the manufacturer does not take credit as soon as the inputs are received in the factory, he would be denied the benefit of CENVAT credit such interpretation is not tenable. 3.7 In respect of capital goods, which are included in the project import, the CENVAT credit shall be admissible only to the extent of an amount not exceeding 50% of the Additional Duty of Customs paid on such capital goods. However, on the other materials, which are not in the nature of capital goods, the CENVAT credit of the Additional Duty paid shall be allowed to the full extent. 3.8 Air-conditioners and refrigerating equipment and computers would be eligible to CENVAT credit as capital goods. The only condition is that the manufacturers should use them in the manufacture of final product. For example, an air-conditioner used in the office premises or a computer used in the office premises of the factory shall not be eligible to CENVAT credit. 3.9 CENVAT credit shall be admissible in respect of the amount of inputs contained in any of the aforesaid waste, refuse or bye product. Similarly, CENVAT should not be denied if the inputs are used in any intermediate of the final product even if such intermediate is exempt from payment of duty. The basic idea is that CENVAT credit is admissible so long as the inputs are used in or in relation to the manufacture of final products, and whether directly or indirectly. 3.10 If the inputs or capital goods are cleared to a job worker, they should be received back within 180 days. If they are not received, the manufacturer shall debit the CENVAT credit attributable to such inputs or capital goods, otherwise it will be an offence. However, the manufacturer shall be entitled to take CENVAT credit as and when the goods sent to the job worker are received back. If part of the goods is received back within 180 days and the rest of the goods are received back after 180 days, the obligation for debiting the credit shall arise only in respect of CENVAT credit attributable to that part which is not received within 180 days. 3.11 Provision has been made for permitting the CENVAT credit when the inputs or capital goods are purchased from the first stage dealer or from the second stage dealer. These dealers should be registered under rule 9 of the Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001The other procedural requirements in respect of first stage dealer and second stage dealer will continue as in the case of modvat rules. 3.12 In the case of capital goods, the CENVAT rules do not provide installation of capital goods as a pre-requisite for taking CENVAT credit. The credit can be taken as and when the capital goods are received in the factory. For example if such capital goods were received prior to 1.4.2001 but not installed up to 1.4.2001, the CENVAT credit would be admissible. However, in respect of all capital goods whether received on or after 1.4.2001 or those that were received prior to 1.4.2001 but not yet installed, the condition that CENVAT credit only up to 50% of the total admissible amount would be available in the financial year 2001-2002 would apply. The balance of the CENVAT credit in respect of such capital goods can be taken in a financial year subsequent to 2001-2002 3.13 The documents on which CENVAT credit can be taken have been prescribed to enable verification, where needed, by the department. The admissibility of the amount of CENVAT credit should be discernible from the records of the manufacturer, including the payment made to the sellers of inputs and capital goods. The basic responsibility is upon manufacturer to prove that inputs or capital goods were purchased and were used by him for the intended purpose.

All such records shall be preserved for a period of five years immediately after the financial year to which such records pertain. (vi) There is no requirement of 'authentication' of records by jurisdictional Central Excise Officer before a book/register is brought into use by an assessee.

Trade and industry are advised to ensure that the requisite information as required under amended rules is scrupulously maintained in their identified private records to avoid any penal action. 2.5 The private records relevant for Central Excise including the Daily Stock Account maintained in compliance with the provisions of the said Rules shall necessarily be kept in the factory to which they pertain.

Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 The conditions and procedure relating to export without payment of duty (i.e. duty under the Central Excise Act, 1944 , the Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Act, 1957 (58 of 1957), the Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile Articles) Act, 1978 (40 of 1978); and special excise duty collected under a Finance Act ) are contained in Notification Nos. 42/2001-Central Excise (N.T.) to 45/2001-Central Excise (N.T.), all dated 26th June, 2001 issued under rule 19 of the Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 (hereinafter referred to as the said Rules). The new rule 19 corresponds to rule 13 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 . 1.2 Some important changes have been introduced under the present procedure, which are mentioned below and explained in detail subsequently - The concept of furnishing of a 'Letter of Undertaking' by a manufacturer-exporter has been introduced. The clearances for export by a manufacturer-exporter will be effected similar to clearances for home consumption after he furnishes Letter of Undertaking. The merchant-exporters are required to file 'bond' in specified format. A manufacturer-exporter may also file bond and follow the 'bond-procedure' specified in the notification. Under bond procedure, the concept of 'self-debit' by the exporter has been introduced. The exporter need not go to the 'bond-accepting authority for a 'debit-certificate' before each removal. The procedure of 'acceptance of proof of export' has been simplified. The concept of ' Self-credit" based on the copy of A.R.E.1 duly certified by Customs authorities at the place of export is being introduced. In each Commissionerate of Central Excise, there will be an officer designated as 'Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise (Exports)' whose functions will be similar to the Maritime Commissioners. Number of copies of 'application for Removal (A.R.E.1)' has been reduced compared to AR-4. This will be further reduced after completion of computer networking in the Department enabling 'on-line verification' of exports.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1There are two categories of export without payment of duty - (i) Export of finished goods without payment of duty under bond or undertaking. (ii) Export of manufactured/processed goods after procuring raw material without payment of duty under bond.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Procedures and conditions for export to all countries except Nepal and Bhutan are specified in notification No. 42/2001-CE(N.T.) dated 26.6.2001. The details are mentioned in this part.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 An exporter shall furnish bond in Form B-1 and obtain certificate in Form CT-1. A manufacturer-exporter may furnish annual Letter of Undertaking (no CT-1 is required in this case). The export shall be subject to the following conditions" - (i) The goods shall be exported within six months from the date on which these were cleared for export from the factory of the production or the manufacture or warehouse or other approved premises within such extended period as the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise or Maritime Commissioner may in any particular case allow; (ii) When the export is from a place other than registered factory or warehouse, the excisable goods are in original packed condition and identifiable as to their origin; (iii) The exports of mineral oil products falling under Chapter 27 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (5 of 1986) as stores for consumption on board of an aircraft on foreign run shall be subject to conditions and limitations, to be applied mutatis mutandis, as notified in the Notification No.40/2001-Central Excise (N.T.) dated 26th June, 2001 issued under rule 18 of the said Rules.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 ARE.1 is the export document for export clearance (Annexure-14), which shall be prepared in quintuplicate (5 copies). This is similar to the erstwhile AR.4. This document shall bear running serial number beginning from the first day of the financial year. During this year, for the sake of continuity, the serial number, as started from 1.4.2001, may continue. The stationary for AR.4 Form may be used with modified name "ARE.1" during this financial year. On A.R.E.1, certain declarations are required to be given by the exporter. These should be signed by the exporter or his authorised agent. The different copies of ARE.1 forms should be of different colours indicated below - Original - White Duplicate - Buff Triplicate - Pink Quadruplicate - Green Quintuplicate - Blue 3.2 It will be sufficient if the copies of ARE.1 contain a color band on the top or right hand corner in accordance with above color scheme. 3.2 An invoice shall also be prepared in terms of rule 11 of the said Rules. It should be prominently mentioned on top "FOR EXPORT WITHOUT PAYMENT OF DUTY". 3.3 The Letter of Undertaking is to be furnished in the Form UT-1 specified in Annexure-15 to Notification No. 42/2001-Central Excise (N.T.), supra. Any manufacturer, who is an assessee for the purposes of the Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 , shall furnish a Letter of Undertaking only to the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise having jurisdiction over his factory from which he intends to export. The Letter of Undertaking should not be furnished to the Maritime Commissioner or any other officer authorised by the Board. A 'Letter of Undertaking' shall be valid for twelve calendar months provided the exporter complies with the conditions of the Letter of Undertaking, especially the procedure for 'acceptance of proof of export' under this instruction. In case of persistent defaults or non-compliance causing threat to revenue, the manufacturer-exporter may be asked to furnish bond with security/surety. For the sake of clarification, it is mentioned that this Letter of Undertaking should not be taken for each consignment of export. 3.4 The obligation of the manufacturer flows from statutory requirement of exporting the goods within six months or such extended period as the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise may allow. Failing this, the exporter is required to deposit the requisite sum (duty and interest) suo moto, considering that the manufacturer has to do 'self-assessment'. Any non-payment within 15 days of expiry of the stipulated time period, shall be treated as arrears of revenue and the Department will proceed to recover the same as 'sum due to Government'. Suo moto payment within 15 days of expiry of the stipulated time period will not be treated as 'default'. 3.5 On repeated failure of the manufacturer-exporter to comply with the conditions of the Letter of Undertaking or the procedure for 'acceptance of proof of export' under this instruction, the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise may direct him in writing that the letter of undertaking is not valid and he should furnish B-1 Bond with sufficient security/surety. 3.6 The Letter of Undertaking shall not be discharged unless the goods are duly exported, to the satisfaction of the Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise or the Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise within the time allowed for such export or are otherwise accounted for to the satisfaction of such officer, or until the full duty due upon any deficiency of goods, not accounted so, and interest, if any, has been paid. 3.7 Though any exporter (Manufacturer-exporter or merchant-exporter) can furnish bond, the merchant-exporters are necessarily required to furnish bond in the B-1 Form specified in Annexure-16 of notification no. 42/2001-Central Excise (N.T.), supra with such security or surety as may be specified by the concerned bond accepting authority. The bond shall be in a sum equal at least to the duty chargeable on the goods for the due arrival of export goods at the place of export and their export therefrom under Customs or as the case may be postal supervision. The officer who will accept the bond, will also be responsible for discharging that bond upon furnishing proof of export by the exporter. 3.8 The bond shall not be discharged unless the goods are duly exported, to the satisfaction of the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise or Maritime Commissioner or such other officer as may be authorised by the Board on this behalf within the time allowed for such export or are otherwise accounted for to the satisfaction of such officer, or until the full duty due upon any deficiency of goods, not accounted so, and interest, if any, has been paid 3.9 Certificate 'CT-1", as specified in Annexure-17 have to be obtained by merchant-exporters for procuring goods from a factory or warehouse. Such certificates need not be obtained for each consignment but will be given in lot of 25.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 4--> 4.1 Bond may be accepted by any of the following officers - (i) The Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise having jurisdiction over the factory or warehouse or any other premises approved by the Commissioner for storing non-duty paid goods; (ii) Maritime Commissioners at Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Paradeep, Kandla, Tuticorin, Visakhapatnam and Cochin. (iii) The Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise(Export) as officers authorised by the Board for this purpose. 4.2 Exporters are required to clearly indicate on the ARE.1 the complete postal address of the authority before whom the bond is executed and to whom the documents are to be submitted/ transmitted for admission of proof of export.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 5--> 5.1 Wherever bond is taken, sufficient security or surety is also required as the per the notifications issued under rule 19 of the said Rules. In 1996, Board had taken a decision that in respect of exporters having good track record may be allowed to furnish bond with nil security or surety. The Board in Circular No.284/118/96 dated 31.12.1996 issued an instruction. Now, since the manufacturer-exporters, who are also assessee of the Central Excise Department, have an option to furnish 'Letter of Undertaking" (without any security or surety), the question of furnishing of 'security or surety' is mainly relate to merchant-exporters who are not assessees of the Central Excise Department. In this scenario, the Board has decided that security (Bank Guarantee or Cash Guarantee or Cash Security) or surety need not be insisted upon from Super Star Trading Houses, Star Trading Houses, Trading Houses and Export Houses provided that - (i) the exporter has not come to adverse notice of the Central Excise or Customs Department in last three years from the date under consideration; (ii) all the formalities required under Central Excise Act and rules made thereunder are regularly complied with by the exporter, especially regarding timely submission of proof of export and deposit of duty with interest in time where proof of export is not received within stipulated time frame; (iii) A self-attested copy of the proof of Status (Super Star Trading Houses, Star Trading Houses, Trading Houses and Export Houses) from concerned authority (Ministry of Commerce and Industry - Directorate General of Foreign Trade) is submitted. 5.2 Other exporters shall be required to furnish surety equal to full bond amount or security equal to twenty five percent. (25%) of the bond amount, along with the bond. 5.3 The bond shall be furnished on non-judicial stamp paper of the value as applicable in the State in which bond is being furnished. 5.4 Where export is effected by merchant-exporter, the bond has to be necessarily furnished . It is open for the manufacturer to furnish bond on behalf of the merchant-exporter. It is clarified that in such cases, the manufacturer will not take a stand that since he is responsible for the duty liability, the export should be allowed on the basis of the 'Letter of Undertaking', which he has already furnished to the Department. In such circumstances, the application in Form ARE.1 will be in the name of the manufacturer who executes the Bond. All other procedures for admission of the proof of export would be the same as in the case of manufacturer-exporters. 5.5 It should be noted that once a manufacturer furnished bond for exports by merchant exporters, it would be his responsibility to account for the export goods. 5.6 It may be noticed that only General bond (B-1) has been specified. Even where bond is required for only one consignment, the Form will remain the same. The exporter may get the bond redeemed immediately after he completes the exports and obtains the proof of export. 5.7 In case of B-1 general bond a running bond account in proforma of Annexure-18 shall be maintained by the exporter because he is responsible for debit the bond before preparation of 'certificate' for obtaining goods for export. He shall also take self-credit in the manner specified in this instruction. 5.8 For the sake of clarity it is informed that the concept of ' Block Transfer' has lost its relevance in the context of self-debit and self-credit of bond and the new system of acceptance of proof of export [to be explained in subsequent paragraphs] by the exporter. 5.9 It is further mentioned that where the merchant exporter executes bond, it shall be necessary that both the merchant-exporter and the manufacturer sign the ARE.1.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 6--> 6.1 A Manufacturer-exporter who has furnished a Letter of Undertaking will prepare the export documents (A.R.E.1 and invoice under rule 11) for clearance from his factory of production. 6.2 A Merchant-exporter who has furnished a bond shall be provided sufficient number of certificates (CT-1), duly signed/certified, in multiples of 25 copies, normally covering a period of one to three months, depending upon the track record of compliance by the exporter. The 'bond accepting authority' shall be responsible for verifying and accepting the proof of export and in case of any defaults by the exporter, to recover the sum and enforcing the bond. The certificate should be provided according to the volume of exports projected by the exporter (which should also reflect in the amount of bond). The compliance of the exporter in submitting the requisite documents towards 'proof of export' shall be another criterion. 6.2.1 The second part of CT-1 is very important. The exporter shall determine the description of goods for procurement from a particular factory or warehouse or an approved place of storage, quantum, value of procurement (provisional figures) and duty involved therein (provisional figures - but based on correct rate of duty and contracted transaction value). This 'duty' element will be debited provisionally. The exporter shall ensure that at the time of debit, sufficient credit is available at that point of time to cover the said debit. The provisional debit shall be converted into final debit within a period of seven days form the date of removal of goods on A.R.E.1, based on the 'duty payable' in goods cleared for export reflected in the said A.R.E.1 and invoice. 6.2.2 The manufacturer shall record the clearance in his Daily Stock Account indicating, inter alia, the invoice number/date, A.R.E.1 number/date and duty payable but foregone under rule 19. 6.3 The exporter has two optional procedures regarding the manner in which he may clear the export consignments from the factory or warehouse or any other approved premises, namely: - Examination and sealing of goods at the place of despatch by a Central Excise Officer Under self-sealing and self-certification
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 7--> 7.1 The exporter is required to prepare five copies of application in the Form ARE-1. The Form is specified in Annexure-I to notification No. 42/2001-Central Excise (N.T.) dated 26.6.2001. The goods shall be assessed to duty in the same manner as the goods for home consumption, though duty is not required to be paid considering clearance is meant for export without payment of duty. The classification and rate of duty should be in terms of Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 read with any exemption notification and/or the said Rules. The value shall be the "transaction value" and should conform to section 4 or section 4A, as the case may be, of the Central Excise Act, 1944It is clarified that this value may be less than, equal to or more than the F.O.B. value indicated by the exporter on the Shipping Bill. 7.2 The duty payable shall be determined on the ARE.1 and invoice and recorded in the Daily Stock Account as "duty foregone on account of export under rule 19". 7.3 The exporter may request the Superintendent or Inspector of Central Excise having jurisdiction over the factory of production or manufacture, warehouse or approved premises for examination and sealing at the place of despatch 24 hours in advance, or such shorter period as may be mutually agreed upon, about the intended time of removal so that arrangements can be made for necessary examination and sealing. 7.4 In case of exports under Duty Exemption Entitlement Certificate Scheme (DEEC), Duty Exemption Pass Book Scheme (DEPB) and claim for Drawback, the Superintendent of Central Excise shall also examine and seal the consignment and sign the documents in token of having done so. In exceptional cases, where the exporter has unblemished track record of compliance (Central Excise) and where there is non-availability of Superintendent of Central Excise due to leave, vacant post or other reasonable causes, the jurisdictional Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise may permit examination and sealing by Inspector. All other types of export may be examined and sealed by the Inspector of Central Excise. 7.5 The Superintendent or Inspector of Central Excise, as the case may be, will verify the identity of goods mentioned in the application and also verify whether the duty self-assessed is appropriate and that the particulars of the duty payable has been has recorded in the Daily Stock Account. If he finds that the declaration in ARE.1 and the invoices are correct from the point of view of identity of goods and its assessment to duty, he shall seal each package or the container ensuring that the goods cannot be tampered with after the examination. Normally, individual packages should be sealed by using wire and lead seals and an all-sides-closed container by using numbered One time Lock/Bottle seals or in such other manner as may be specified by the Commissioner of Central Excise by a special or general written order. Thereafter, the said officer shall endorse and sign each copy of the application in token of having such examination done and put his stamp with his name and designation below his signature;

Sales made by manufacturer of the goods' to the merchant exporter which ultimately are exported are exempt from Central Sales Tax. The Sales Tax Department issues booklet to the merchant exporters containing serially numbered H-Forms/ST-XXII form or equivalent Sales Tax form. After the goods have been exported by the merchant exporters, the latter issues these forms to the manufacturers of the goods. The merchant exporters in turn have to account all these serially numbered forms to the sales Tax Department by furnishing a proof that the goods have been exported out. These proofs are in the from of presentation of the Shipping Bill duly completed by the customs, bill of landing, foreign exchange remittance certificates etc. The liability of the manufacturers to the Central Sales Tax gets discharged only when they submit these forms to the Sales Tax Department. It is, therefore, seen that indirectly exports get accounted for through the issue of H-form or ST-XXII Form. Thus, photocopy of H-form or ST-XXII Form or any other equivalent Sales Tax form duly attested and stamped by the manufacturer or his authorised agent will be accepted for purpose of proof of export. 4.2 Submission of proof of export and processing thereof 4.2.1 The proof of export should be submitted to the Range Officer within a period of 6 months from the date of clearance of goods from the factory of production. 4.2.2 If Range Superintendent finds that the clearances for home consumption, and the clearances for export where proof of exports have not been furnished within 6 months, when taken together, are likely to exceed the exemption limit (which is presently Rs. 100 lakhs for home consumption), he should issue show cause notices for safeguarding revenue. These show cause notices, however, should be kept pending for another three months by which time proof of exports are expected to be received. 4.2.3 The Range Superintendent will maintain manufacturer wise record on the basis of the quarterly return and the proof of exports submitted by the manufacturer from time to time in order to ascertain that the clearances for exports and the proofs of exports are duly accounted for and in case of failure on the part of exporter to submit proof of export, necessary action can be initiated promptly on the lines already mentioned in the above para. 4.2.4 In case clearances of such manufacturers for home consumption plus clearance for export where proof of export were not furnished within 6 months, exceed the exemption limit, they should take Central Excise Registration and follow the regular A.R.E.1 procedure. 4.2.5 This procedure will also be applicable to exports of ready-made garments.

This refers to excisable goods (dutiable or exempted) as well as non-excisable goods. Thus, the benefit of input stage rebate can be claimed on export of all finished goods whether excisable or not. 1.3 It may be also noted that materials, as defined in the said rule 19 may be used for manufacture or processing. In other words, any processing not amounting to manufacture (such as packing, blending etc.) will also be eligible for the benefit under said notification. 1.4 Removal without payment of duty of equipment and machinery in the nature of capital goods used in relation to manufacture or process of finished goods shall not be allowed.

However, in case, the input output norms notified under the Export Import Policy does not include all the materials used in export goods, the claim under this scheme should not be denied merely on that ground. 2.3 If for any reason the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise is not satisfied with reference to the correctness of the consumption norms claimed by the applicant, especially where the product is being manufactured for the first time in his jurisdiction, he may permit the manufacturing operations and the verification of the consumption norms should be completed while the process of manufacture is on. The verification should be completed before allowing the export of the goods as the manufacturer working under this Scheme is expected to declare the raw materials costumed in ARE-2. 2.4 The permission granted by the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise can be withdrawn at any time if any glaring misuse resulting into loss of revenue comes to his notice. 2.5 Any change in the consumption ratio [input-output ratio] should be promptly intimated by the manufacturer to the deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise and the jurisdictional Range Superintendent giving reference of the permission granted. If necessary, the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise may order fresh verification.

In rule 18 of the Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 and Notification 41/2001-Central Excise (N.T.) dated 26.6.2001, the expression "processing" has been used. It includes blending, packaging or any other operation. One problem which comes into the way is that the Notification No. 41/2001-CE (N.T.), supra, provides for procurement of goods directly from the factory of manufacture and the open market procurement is allowed only where goods are in original packed condition and the invoices are issued by registered dealers. In case of tea, condition relating to open market purchase cannot be fulfilled. Accordingly, a special procedure has been framed for export of tea bought in auctions (on which duty is paid at specific rate), under claim of rebate regard are specified below -

(ii) in case of tea purchased in auctions, the brokers catalogue indicating the details of the invoices on which the bulk tea was removed from the factory for home consumption on payment of appropriate duty and the broker´s contract relating to purchase of such tea is submitted along with rebate claim. (iii) in case tea is purchased other than in auctions, copies of relevant invoices evidencing payment of duty are submitted along with rebate claim. 2.3 It shall be ensured that exporters do not claim drawback as well as rebate under notification 41/2001-CE(N.T.), supra., simultaneously.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Refund of any duty of excise is governed by Section 11B of the Central Excise Act, 1944By definition, refund includes rebate of duty paid on goods exported out of India or on materials used in the manufacture of goods exported out of India. The refund claim can be filed within one year from the relevant date in the specified Form [for the time being the format R-1 specified under rule 173S of the erstwhile Central Excise Rules, 1944 ] by an assessee or even a person who has borne the duty incidence, to the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise having jurisdiction over the factory of manufacture. 1.2 The "relevant date" has been defined in the said section and refund of duty paid can be sought provided the manufacturer has not passed on the burden of duty. In case the burden of duty has been passed on, the refund can be claimed by the person who has actually paid the duty or, in the alternative, the amount can be deposited in the Consumer Welfare Fund created by the statute. 1.3 The Central Excise Act also provided for payment of interest on delayed payment of refund. As per Section 11BB, if any duty ordered to be refunded under Section 11B has not been refunded within three months from the date of receipt of the refund application in the prescribed manner and form along with the supporting documentary evidence as laid down in the relevant rules, interest at the rate notified by the Government shall have to be paid on such duty from the date immediately after the expiry of three months from the date of receipt of application till the date of refund of such duty.

If the claim is filed without requisite documents, it may lead to delay in sanction of the refund. Moreover, the claimant of refund is entitled for interest in case refund is not given within three months of the filing of claim. Incomplete claim will not be in the interest of the Department. Consequently, submission of refund claim without supporting documents will not be allowed. Even if post or similar mode files the same, the claim should be rejected or returned with Query Memo (depending upon the nature/importance of document not filed). The claim shall be taken as filed only when all relevant documents are available.

This should be done, as far as possible, the moment refund claim is received and in case of any deficiency, the same should be pointed out to the applicant with a copy to the Range Officer within 15 days of receipt. 3.3 In the Divisional Offices, final processing of refund claims after the receipt of Range Officer's report should be completed including the verification of the fact whether the assessee has passed on the duty incidence to their buyer (in cases where the refund claim is filed by a manufacturer or owner of warehoused goods). The types of cases to which this provision will not be attracted are already specified in section 11B itself. Where the duty incidence has been passes on, the duty refund, if otherwise admissible, will be ordered in file, but will also be ordered to be credited to the Consumer Welfare Fund. The burden of proving that the duty incidence has not been passes on, is on the claimant and the latter may be required to submit sufficient documentary proof for this purpose. It is clarified that the question of unjust enrichment has to be looked into case by case. There cannot be a general instruction indicating the documents and /or record, which the claimant should produce as a proof that he has not, passes on the duty incidence to any other person. 3.4 Claim for refund of less than Rs. 100 shall not entertained in respect of all excisable commodities.

Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 5--> 5.1 As soon as possible, after matches are finished, they shall, unless intended for export, be put into boxes or booklets which shall then, save as otherwise provided by these procedures, be affixed with Central Excise Stamps and enclosed in packets or other outer coverings as the case may be. 5.2 Every Central Excise Stamp shall be so affixed that - (i) the box or booklet on which the Central Excise Stamp is affixed can not be opened without tearing the Central Excise Stamp; (ii) when it is affixed to a box, the Central Excise Stamp shall cover one side of the inner tray and a part of the rear or bottom or front or top of the outer box, and the Central Excise Stamp itself shall not be covered by either the factory's label or any advertisement label; 5.3 Where the matches are intended for export out of India, the Central Excise Stamps need not be affixed thereto and, unless they are to be exported without payment of duty in accordance with rule 19 of the said Rules, the duty shall be paid by the assessee before removal of each consignment by debit to the account current maintained by him. 5.4 Where the Board is satisfied that by reason of the fact that the necessary Central Excise Stamps are not available or for any other relevant reason it is necessary or expedient so to do, it may, by general or special order, allow the duty on matches to be paid, without affixing Central Excise Stamps to such box or booklet, by debit to the account current before the removal of each consignment subject to any condition which may be imposed in the order.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 6--> 6.1 No packet or case containing boxes or booklets of matches, other than those intended for export out of India and those to which the provisions of the paragraph 4(c) above apply, shall be closed and reckoned as a unit unless a Central Excise Stamp of the appropriate class has been affixed to each box or booklet in the specified manner. 6.2 Each case or packet shall contain only an integral number whether one hundred boxes or booklets of matches or multiples thereof. The boxes or booklets in each case or packet shall contain the same number of matches on the average and shall, except where the matches are exempted from bearing Central Excise Stamps, bear Central Excise Stamps of the same class. 6.3 Every packet, box or booklet, or the manufacturers label affixed thereto shall bear in clearly discernable characters, the name of the factory or a distinguishing mark, which may take the form of a special design whereby the origin of the matches can be traced. Specimens of all such labels shall be submitted to the Superintendent in-charge of the factory duly declaring the ownership of the label before that are brought into use. In case, the label is owned by some other manufacturer, a consent letter from the owner of the label duly declaring the rate of duty applicable to him, should also be filed. 6.4 Each case or packet of matches shall be legibly marked in ink or oil colour with progressive number, commencing with number 1, for each year and in different series for each class of matches, the number of boxes or booklets in hundreds contained in each case or packet and the grade of Central Excise Stamps affixed thereto. 6.5 Every box or booklet of matches, issued for home consumption, shall have on the box or booklet, or on the manufacturers label affixed thereto, a statement in clearly discernable character of the sticks contained in the box or booklet, and of the retail price at which the manufacturer intends that the box or booklet should be sold. However, the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise may, by an order in writing and subject to such limitations and conditions, as may be prescribed by him in the order, relax this requirement.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 7--> 7.1 If any Central Excise Stamps are torn during examination or inspection taken up by the Inspector or Superintendent of Central Excise, the said officer may order that the containers to which they are affixed shall be returned to the registered person for re-stamping and shall be replaced immediately by an equal number of boxes or booklets of the same class from the finished stock. 7.2 If examination or inspection by the Inspector or Superintendent of Central Excise shows that Central Excise Stamps of insufficient value have been affixed, the said officer may order the boxes or booklets in question to be returned to the factory, where the Central Excise Stamps shall be removed and replaced by others of the proper value.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 8--> 8.1 All boxes or booklets containing matches intended for export and on which no Central Excise Stamps have been affixed, shall be packed into cases or packets on which shall be pasted labels inscribed " Matches not affixed with Central Excise Stamps for Export" and shall be entered in daily stock account maintained under rule 10 of the said Rules.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 9--> 9.1 When it is desired to remove matches bearing Central Excise Stamps purchased on credit, the registered person shall, unless he maintains an account current with the Commissioner, pay the price of the Central Excise Stamps and no such matches may be removed until after the price of the Central Excise Stamps has been so paid or has been debited to such account current, if any.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 In accordance with the principles of natural justice the central excise law provides that before any action is taken against an assessee he must be given reasonable opportunity of presenting his case. One such situation would be that relating to the demand of duty not paid, short paid or erroneously refunded. 1.2 As see, a show cause notice is invariable to be issued if the department contemplates any action prejudicial to the assessee. Thus, if on account of an infraction of the provisions of the central excise law it is considered appropriate to penalise the defaulter, it is necessary to first issue a show cause notice. The show cause notice would detail the provisions of law allegedly violated and ask the notice to show cause why action should not be initiated against him. Thus, a show cause notice gives the notice the opportunity to present his case.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2. 1 Section 11A of the Central Excise Act, 1944 provides that if excise duty has not been levied or short levied or not paid or short paid, a notice has to be issued demanding the differential duty. This notice will be issued by Commissioner of Central Excise if the amount demanded does not exceeding one crore rupees. Where amount exceeds one crore rupees, prior approval of the Chief Commissioner of Central Excise is required. 2.2 The Board has also empowered the Officers of Director General of Central Excise Intelligence to issue Show-cause notices in accordance with the powers of Central Excise Officers conferred on them under rule 3 and the instruction above. 2.3 In order to provide mechanism for early dispute resolution, it has also been provided in the Act that an assessee may request for waiver of notice, if he deposits the amount of differential duty on his own along with interest in respect of only such cases where such non-levy or short levy or non-payment or short payment is by reason other than suppression of facts, fraud, collusion etc. 2.4 By opting for waiver of issue of notice, the assessee may avoid long drawn process of adjudication and appellate process including interest on the differential duty demanded. It is therefore, advisable that in cases where the assessee is convinced that the Department is correct in demanding duty, he may opt for this facility.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Central Excise law is a self-contained provision. Besides containing the provisions for levy of duty, the law also provides for the adjudication of matters relating to the legal provisions. The adjudication is done by the departmental officers, and in this capacity they act as quasi-judicial officers.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 Adjudication of confiscation and penalty has to be done by Officers specified in section 33 of the Central Excise Act, 1944Central Excise Officers have the power to determine duty short paid or not paid erroneously refunded under section 11A of the said Act. For this purposes, the Board has decided the powers of adjudication and determination of duty shall be exercised, based on monetary limit (duty involved in a case) - (A) All cases involving fraud, collusion, any wilful misstatement, suppression of facts, or contravention of Central Excise Act/ Rules made there under-with intent to evade payment of duty and / or where extended period has been invoked in show-cause-notices, (including CENVAT cases, will be adjudicated by:- Central Excise Officers Powers of Adjudication (Amount of duty involved) Commissioners Without limit Additional Commissioners Upto Rs. 20 lakhs Joint Commissioners Upto Rs. 10 lakhs (B) Cases which do not fall under the category (A) above, will be adjudicated as follows:- Central Excise Officers Powers of Adjudication (Amount of duty involved) Commissioners Without limit Additional /Joint Commissioners Above Rs. 2 lakhs and upto Rs. 20 lakhs Deputy/Assistant Commissioners Upto Rs. 2 lakhs (C) Cases related to issues mentioned under first proviso to Section 35B(1) of Central Excise Act, 1944 would be adjudicated by the Addl. Commissioners/ Joint Commissioners without any monetary limit. (D) All cases relating to determination of classification and valuation will be adjudicated by the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise without any monetary limit. 2.2 The Board, under section 2(b) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 read with rule 3 also invests certain officers with powers of Commissioners or other officers through out the territory of India, for the purpose of investigation and adjudication.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Interest of duty not paid on time is provided for in the Central Excise statute. It is expected that the interest provision would normally not have to be invoked as the assessee would make the duty payment on time. 1.2 Penalty and confiscation of offending goods i.e. which have violated the provision of the Central Excise law are an outcome of the adjudication proceedings. These are deterrents aimed at cautioning the dishonest taxpayer.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 Under the provisions of Section 11AA, interest is charged on the delayed payment of duty. Thus, it is in the interest of an assessee to discharge the duty liability the earliest and not to prolong the dispute only for the sake of delaying payments. The interest will be charged under said Section 11AA, as follows: (a) In the normal case interest will be charged for the period of delay after 3 months of the determination of the duty liability till the date of payment of duty. (b) In the case the duty is not paid on account of fraud, suppression etc. the interest will be charged from the first date of the month following the month in which the duty was not paid. 2.2 There may not be need for any explicit mention of the interest liability in the show-cause notice since the legal provisions are explicit. However, the same may be done as a matter of abundant precaution. Likewise, the adjudicating officer may incorporate the fact about the interest liability in the order confirming the demand.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 Penalty is imposed under any of the following provisions of the Central Excise Act, 1944 or the rules made thereunder:- (i) Section 11AC prescribes a mandatory penalty equal to the duty not levied or paid or short paid or erroneously refunded by reason of fraud, suppression etc. However, in the vent the duty and interest thereon is paid within 30 days of the communication of the order, the penalty shall be 25% of the duty subject to it being paid within the said period of 3o days. (ii) Rule 25 of the said Rules provides for penalty on any producer, manufacturer, registered person of a warehouse or a registered dealer not exceeding the duty on the excisable goods in respect of which any of the specified contravention have been committed, or rupees ten thousand, whichever is greater. The penalty is subject to the provisions of Section 11 AC of the Central Excise Act, 1944The offending goods are also liable to confiscation. The specified contravention are: (a) Removal of any excisable goods in contravention of any of the provisions of the said rules or the notifications issued under the said rules; or (b) Non-accountal of any excisable goods produced or manufactured or stored; or (c) Manufacture, production or storage of any excisable goods without having applied for the registration certificate required under Section 6 of the Central Excise Act ; or (d) Contravention of any of the provisions of the said rules or the notifications issued under the said rules with intent to evade payment of duty. (iii) Under rule 26 of the said Rules It is provided that any person who acquires possession of, or is in any way concerned in transporting, removing, depositing, keeping, concealing, selling or purchasing, or in any other manner deals with, any excisable goods which he knows or has reason to believe are liable to confiscation under the Act or the said Rules, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding the duty on such goods or rupees ten thousand, whichever is greater. (iv) Rule 27 of the said Rules provides for imposition of a general penalty penalty which may extend to five thousand rupees and with confiscation of the goods in respect of which the offence is committed. This is attracted when no other specific penalty is provided for. 3.2 If penalty is imposed under Section 11AC, penalty under rule 25 will not be imposed. This, however, does not preclude the Department from confiscating the goods, imposing any fine in lieu of confiscation and prosecuting a person. 3.3 Rule 26 of the said Rules also provides that before any order of penalty or confiscation is passed the adjudicating authority shall follow the principles of natural justice. In other words a notice explaining the reasons why penalty should not be imposed or goods confiscated has to be given to the person. Thereafter, reasonable opportunity shall be given to such person to explain or defend his case. The adjudicating Officer shall pass a reasoned order, incorporating the defence arguments given by such person or his authorised representative. 3.4 As per Rule 28 of the said Rules, when any goods are confiscated under these rules, such thing shall thereupon vest in the Central Government. Accordingly, the Central Excise Officer adjudging confiscation shall take and hold possession of the things confiscated, and every Officer of Police, on the requisition of such Central Excise Officer, shall assist him in taking and holding such possession. 3.5 Rule 30 provides that if the owner of the goods, the confiscation of which has been adjudged, exercises his option to pay fine in lieu of confiscation, he may be required to pay such storage charges as may be determined by the adjudicating officer. 3.6 Provisions for disposal of goods confiscated are contained in rule 29 of the said Rules. Goods of which confiscation has been adjudged and in respect of which the option of paying a fine in lieu of confiscation has not been exercised, shall be sold, destroyed or otherwise disposed of in such manner as the Commissioner may direct.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 4--> 4.1 As per Section 11B of the Central Excise Act, 1944 the time limitation of application for refund of duty fixed at one year from the relevant date shall not apply when the duty has been paid under protest. 4.2 Any assessee who desires to pay duty under protest, may do so by following the procedure mentioned below: The assessee shall inform the Superintendent or Inspector of Central Excise in writing giving reasons for paying duty under protest and a dated acknowledgement will be given to him. He will mark invoices or monthly/quarterly return indicating the goods on which duty is paid 'under protest'. If it is a lump-sum duty payment in respect of past demand, he may record the fact of duty payment under protest in the Personal Ledger Account [against debits] CENVAT Account [against debits] and the Daily Stock Account. If a case is appealed against by the assessee or where the appeal period for further appeal is available, he may continue to pay duty under protest. However, if decision is not in his favour and he exhausts the appellate remedy or does not appeal within stipulated period, the assessee shall not have ay right to pay duty under protest. 4.3 A letter of protest or a representation for paying duty under protest shall not constitute a claim of refund.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Bond is an instrument by which the obligation to pay money is created expressly. It is also a legal agreement whereby a person undertakes to do or not to do anything subject to conditions stipulated in the agreement. The primary purpose of the bond is to secure due compliance with the rules and procedures laid down under the Excise law. A bond is a collateral security , which the department is securing to ensure payment of appropriate duty in addition to the statutory provisions available . 1.2 As a measure of rationalization and simplification of excise law and procedures the number of bonds have been further reduced. Several bonds, which were in vogue prior to 1 st July, 2001 have since been dispensed with. Care should be taken with regard to bonds, which were executed prior to 1st July, 2001 while discharging the same. These bonds should be discharged only after the completion/performance of the obligation.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 Bonds are basically two types, i.e. surety and security. Under a surety bond another person stands as surety to guarantee the performance on the part of obligor. The surety should be for the full value of the bond and the person standing as surety should be solvent to the extent of the bond amount. Under the Contract Act the liability of the surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor and hence the department is at liberty to enforce the recovery of the dues either from the obligor or from the surety. 2.2 The following are the types of bonds, which are presently in vogue: (a) B-1 Surety / Security (General Bond) - for export of goods without payment of duty under Rule 19; (b) B-2 Bond Surety / Security(General Bond) - for provisional assessment; (c) B-3 Bond Surety / Security) - to obtain matches Central Excise stamp on credit; (d) B-4 Bond Surety/Security - for provisional release of seized goods (provided in this Manual by instruction); and (e) B-17 Bond (General) Surety / Security - composite bond for EPZ/ 100% EOUs for assessment, export, accounting and disposal of excisable goods obtained free of duty [continuation of the Format as specified under the erstwhile Central Excise Rules, 1944 ].
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 The bond should be executed on the non-judicial stamp paper of appropriate value. The bond amount should be sufficient to cover the duty liability. The bond should be signed by the obligor or by the authorised agent. The surety should be for the full amount and the person standing as surety should be solvent to extent of the amount covered. The security should normally be limited to the 25% of the bond amount. 3.2 In case of exporters, certain specific categories i.e. Super Star Trading House, Star Trading House, Exporters registered with Export Promotion Council & Registered Exporters need not furnish any bank guarantee/cash security while executing export bonds. They may furnish sureties only. This is a modification over the previous instruction contained in Board's Circular No.284/118/96-Cx dated 31.12.96. 3.3 In the case of 100% E.O.Us obtaining indigenous goods without payment of duty under a notification issued under section 5A of the Central Excise Act, 1944 , acceptance of surety bond instead of bank guarantee is permissible. In respect of 100% EOUs & EPZ s units may continue to execute bond in the Format given in Form B-17 under the erstwhile Central Excise Rules, 1944While executing combined B17 Bond security to the extent of 5% of the value of the bond in the form bank guarantee or cash deposit or any other mode of security may be accepted in lieu of surety (Board's letter F.No.305/86/98-FTT dated 19./6/98). Fresh bond may not be taken, where the existing units have already furnished bond in B-17 Form prior to 1.7.2001. The existing bond may be simply re-validated under the new rules. 3.4 The export bonds executed under rule 19 of the said Rules should be accepted within 24 Hours or the next working day and communicated to the exporter by the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner of Central Excise or Maritime Commissioner or any other officer authorised by the Board in this behalf. 3.5 Bonds should be executed in favour of and in the name of the President of India. They should be properly stamped. The prescribed wordings of the bond form must be copied out on a non judicial stamp paper of the appropriate amount (to be locally ascertained), except where arrangement can be made for embossing printed forms or where the State Government rules require otherwise. The bonds must be executed on stamp paper of the respective State Government in which the registered persons business is situated.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 4--> 4.1 The amount of the bond in forms B-2 should be fixed on the following basis:- (i) The amount of the specific bond in Form B-2 should be sufficient to cover the difference between the duty payable on provisional assessment and the probable duty payable if the highest rate / value applicable such goods has to be applied. (ii) The amount of the general bond in Form B-2(surety)/(Security) should be equal to the difference between the duty payable on provisional assessment and the probable duty payable applying the highest rate / value applicable to such goods for a period of 3 months. If the provisional assessment cannot be completed within the 3 months and longer time is required, say a period of one year, in appropriate cases, differential duty likely to arise during such period shall be the basis/ determination of the bond amount. When the security bond is executed, the amount of security will be generally fixed at 25% of the bond amount. However, in appropriate cases, for special reasons to be recorded, the proper officer under rule 7 of the said Rules may order for a higher security amount. In the event of death or insolvency or insufficiency of the surety / security, the proper officer may demand fresh bond. If the security furnished is found to be inadequate, he may demand additional security also. In the case of provisional assessment, if the assessee fails to make the due adjustment within the period of 15 days after the final assessment made, the proper officer may proceed to enforce the bond or encash the bank guarantee after due notice to the assessee.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 5--> 5.1 All bonds must bear stamps on the scale prescribed by article 57 of the schedule I to the Indian Stamp Act 1899 , modified as may be, by State Legislation. Commissionerate should circulate to their staff the rate of stamp duty required in each State within Commissionerate for each type of bond. 5.2 Whoever affixes an adhesive stamp to any instrument chargeable with duty which has been executed by any person shall when affixing such stamp cancel the same so that it cannot be used again and whom so ever has executed any instrument on any paper bearing an adhesive stamp shall at the time of execution unless such stamp has been already been cancelled in the manner aforesaid, cancel the same so that it cannot be used again. Any instrument bearing an adhesive stamp, which has not been cancelled so that it cannot be used again, shall so far as such stamp is concerned be deemed to be un-stamped. The person required to cancel an adhesive stamp may cancel it by writing on or cross the stamp with his name or initials or the name or initial of his firm with the true date of his so writing, or in any other effectual manner.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 6--> 6.1 The Board has decided that every undertaking owned and managed directly through any Ministry, Directorate or Directorates by the Central Government is exempt from the execution of any bond; or a State Government is hereby exempt from furnishing any security or surety for bond, where the execution of such bond, or, as the case may be furnishing of security or surety is required by or under any other provision of the rules made under Central Excise Act, 1944 . 6.2 An undertaking owned or controlled by the Central Government or State Government does not include-any undertaking belonging to corporation owned or controlled by the Central Government or State Government and established by or under a Central Provisional or State Act; or any undertaking belonging to Government Company within the meaning of Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (I of 1956).
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 7--> 7.1 The security to be furnished in respect of the bonds will be, as follows: (i) The security furnished should either be cash, Government promissory notes, post office savings, bank deposits, national savings Certificates, National Defence Bonds, National Defence Gold Bonds, 1980 or similar realizable Government papers. Promissory Notes and stock Certificates of the Central Government or a State Government shall be accepted subject to the conditions laid down in clause (ii) of Rule 274 of GFR. (ii) Deposit receipt of bank can also be pledged as securities for Central Excise - Bonds subject to certain specific conditions under Rule 274 (vi) of G.F.R. The conditions inter alia are: (a) The deposit receipt shall be made out in the name of the pledgee or if it is made out in the name of the pledger, the bank shall certify on it that the deposit can be withdrawn only on demand or with the sanction of the pledgee. (b) The depositors shall agree in writing to undertake any risk involved in the investment and make good the depreciation, if any. (c) The depositors shall receive the interest when due, direct from the bank on a letter from the pledgee authorising the bank to pay it to him. (d) The responsibility of the pledgee in connection with the deposit and the interest on it will cease when he issues a final withdrawal order to the depositor and sends an intimation to the Bank that he has done so. (e) Only the larger Scheduled banks are to be considered as recognized banks approved by Government for the purpose of item of Rule 274 of G.F.R. (f) Interest on the securities will, however, continue to accrue and will be realised by the holders on discharge of the bond and return of the securities. (g) Where the same bond and security continue for over one year, arrangements must be made for credit or payment of the interest on such securities to the bonders. (h) On cash securities no interest is payable. In the case of Savings Bank Account, the interest may be paid to the parties on claim preferred by them periodically or can be collected after the amount is returned to them. In respect of other securities, arrangements are to be made for the payment of interest at regular intervals of 6 months.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 8--> 8.1 Whenever surety bond is executed it is to be ensured that both the obligor and surety sign the bond. Field officers will ensure that surety is financially sound and have been verified from time to time. Whenever bank guarantee is accepted for security, care should be taken to get the guarantee renewed before expiry from time to time, so as to enable the enforcement of liability as and when such need arises. Execution of B17 Bonds is optional and if the assessee does not wish to avail of this facility, he may execute individual bonds prescribed for different purposes. 8.2 A partner or a director of a limited company can also stand as surety in his individual capacity to guarantee the performances of the firm or a company as the case may be. Since, in law, a limited company is a distinct legal entity and the member of the company including directors are distinct from the company, there should be no objection to allow the directors of the limited company to stand as surety for the companies provided they fulfil all the other conditions applicable to sureties. (F. No. 8/10/16/CX II dt 5/8/1960)
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 9--> 9.1 The provisions governing the execution of bonds by banks are, as follows: (i) When the State Bank of India or a scheduled bank gives a guarantee for a registered person with or without deposit of security, the guarantee bond should provide a period of validity and an extra period during which obligations arising during the period of validity to be enforced. The time limit for enforcement of obligation should be at least two years. (ii) Where there is a need for extension of the period of validity of bank guarantee furnished by the bank on behalf of a party in pursuant to an order of an original or appellate authority or any other reasons, it should be done by means of supplementary deed of bank guarantee on a stamp paper.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 10--> 10.1 Proper preservation of bonds is to be ensured in the interest of the revenue. (i) Bonds must be preserved as long as they are valid and should be returned only after all the obligations under the bond had been discharged. (ii) All officers who filled Central Excise bonds must be careful not to enforce the words "cancelled" on the bonds even after the apparent fulfilment of obligation ; otherwise it is likely to be argues that persons liable under the bond have been their by discharge from the liabilities imposed by the bond. The obligations under the bond are not legally extinguished so long as the bond is not returned to the obligor or is not cancelled on execution of a deed of cancellation.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 11--> 11.1 In respect of surety bonds, periodical verification, preferably on an annual basis will be made by the jurisdictional Central Excise Officers so as to ensure the sureties are financially sound, solvent and alive. The enquiry to verify the financial stability of the sureties will be made by any of the following methods: (i) By reference to the surety's bankers. (ii) By making personal enquiries and ascertaining whether the surety possesses a house or other immovable property, industrial equipment, shop etc. which would cover the bond amount. Alternatively, the sureties may themselves be asked to furnish a list of their property, which may be verified by the Officer. (iii) By reference to Revenue Officer not below the rank of Tahsildar or a Mamalakdar. (iv) The result of enquiry as well as the solvency of the surety should be incorporated in the records of the Department.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 In conventional sense, Audit means scrutiny and verification of documents, events and processes in order to verify facts and, draw conclusions regarding the correctness of recording of facts and the efficiency of a system under study. For Central Excise purposes Audit means scrutiny of the records of assessee and the verification of the actual process of receipt, storage, production and clearance of goods with a view to check whether the assessee is paying the central excise duty correctly and following the central excise procedures. 1.2 Under the conventional /traditional system of central excise audit, audit parties visit assessees unit without much preparation and verify all the statutory records (i.e. those prescribed under the Central Excise law) to check compliance of procedures and also leakage of revenue, if any. Experiences show that such audits do not result in detection of major aberrations. Most of the audit objections pertain to either minor procedural irregularity or duty short payment of small amounts mostly due to human error. Further, this method of auditing does not envisage checking of the internal records of the assessee as well as those records which are maintained by the assessee under the other laws like Income Tax Act, Sales Tax Act, Companies Act etc. 1.3 One of the announcements made during Budget 2000 as a measure of simplification of procedures, was the dispensation of all statutory records under the central excise law. No longer was the assessee required to record the receipt of raw material, production and clearance/sale of finished goods etc. in registers/documents prescribed by the central excise department. As a result, the assesses are now allowed to maintain all their records in whichever form they like (including maintenance of the entire records in electronic form) provided the essential information required for calculation of central excise duty liability can be obtained from such records. Under these circumstances it becomes necessary for the auditors to look into the assessees own (private) records to verify whether the assessee is paying central excise duty correctly and following the laid down procedures. 1.4 Another change brought in recent years is doing away the system of assessment of the returns by the departmental officers. Now the assessee is required to self assess his monthly tax returns (called the E.R.1/E.R.2) before filing the same with the department. The departmental officers only scrutinise this return to check for any apparent mistake made by the assessee. They are not required to carry out detailed verification. Therefore, the entire burden of checking whether the assessee actually paying his taxes correctly, now lies with audit. 1.5 The statutory changes resulting in dispensation of statutory records as well as self assessment of central excise duty by the assessee has led to the conventional/traditional system of audit becoming irrelevant.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 Traditional audit will eventually be replaced by Excise Audit 2000 (EA 2000), a new system of audit. This new system was initiated from 1 st December 1999 when it was implemented in case of all assessees paying cash duty of over Rs.5 crores per annum. In September 2000, the Central Board of Excise and Customs made this audit applicable in case of all assessees paying cash duty of over Rs. 1 crore per annum. At present, in addition to audit of such units, those units which pay cash duty of Rs. 10 lakhs or more but less than Rs.1 Crore will be audited once in two years. Not more than 20% of the Units paying cash duty less than Rs.10lakhs are to be audited in a year. It is expected that by April 2002, all assessees will be subjected to EA 2000. 2.2 The essential philosophy of EA 2000 is that this audit is based on the scrutiny of business records of the assessee. This is a more systematic form of audit wherein the auditors are required to gather basic information about the assesee and analyze them to find out vulnerable areas before conducting the actual audit. The audit is therefore more focused and in-depth as compared to the traditional audit. Further, at every stage of audit, the assessee is consulted. This makes EA2000 audit user friendly.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 Selection of Assessee 3.1.1 The process of EA 2000 begins with identification of a unit to be audited. Normally, there are about 1000 to 1500 assessees under the jurisdiction of a Central Excise Commissionerate. It is not possible for the audit staff to conduct audits of all the units every year. Therefore, depending upon the manpower availability, about 300 to 400 units are selected for conducting audit during a financial year. Under the conventional system of audit the units were picked up randomly without any scientific basis of selection. Under EA 2000, the selection of the unit is based taking into account in the 'risk-factors'. This means that the assessees who have a bad track record (having past duty evasion cases, major audit objections, past duty dues etc.) are given priority for conducting audit over those having clean track record. 3.2 Desk Review 3.2.1 The auditors are assigned the assessees to be audited at the beginning of the financial year. The auditors are required to gather as much information about the assessee as possible. They can gather information from the departmental records, published documents like balance sheets annual statements etc., and through market Enquirer. Since this can be done without interacting with the assessee, this step called as 'desk-review'. 3.3 Documenting Information 3.3.1 At the stage of 'Desk Review' the auditors may have already identified certain areas, which warrant closer examination. The auditor may also require certain documents or information from the assessee to complete his preliminary investigation. For this he may write letter to the assessee or send him a questionnaire to obtain this information. This step is called 'gathering and documenting assessee information'. 3.4 Touring 3.4.1 The auditor then visits the unit of the assessee to see the actual running of the unit, the systems that are followed for maintaining records in various sections and the system of movement of goods and the related documents within the unit. This step is called 'touring of the premises'. This gives the auditors a general overview about the procedure adopted by the assessee and the possible loopholes through which revenue leakage can take place. 3.5 Audit Plan 3.5.1 Based on his experiences and the information gathered so far about the assessee, the auditor now makes a 'audit plan'. The idea of developing audit plan is to list the areas which, as per the auditor are the vulnerable areas from the revenue point of view. Since number of documents/records maintained by assessee is huge in number, it also necessary that the auditor should select only some of them for the actual verification. The preparation of audit plan helps him to do that. It must be remembered that audit plan is not rigid but a dynamic concept. During the course of audit if the auditor notices certain new facts or new aspects of the planned area of audit, he can always alter the audit plan accordingly, with the approval of his supervisor. Similarly, in case during the actual audit, if the auditor is convinced that any area which was earlier planned for verification does not require in-depth scrutiny, he may alter the plan midway after obtaining approval of the superior officers. Preparation of audit plan is one of the most important steps of EA 2000. A well thought audit plan generally increases the success of audit result manifolds. 3.6 Verification 3.6.1 The most important step of audit is the conduct of actual audit, which in technical parlance is called 'Verification'. The auditors visit the unit of the assessee on a scheduled date (informed to the assessee in advance) and carry out the scrutiny of the records of the assessee as per the audit plan. The auditor is required to compare the documentation of a fact from different documents. For example, the auditor may check the figures of clearance of finished goods showed by the assessee in central excise return with the sales figures of the said goods in Balance Sheet, Sales Tax Returns, Bank statements etc. The auditor may also enquire about the entries which appear vague (say an entry like 'Misc. Income') in various records and documents. The idea behind conduct of verification is to reasonably ensure that no amount, which as per the Central Excise law is chargeable to duty, escapes taxation. The process of verification is always carried out in presence of the assessee so that he can clarify the doubts and provide required information to the auditor. 3.7 Audit Objection and Audit Para 3.7.1 Where the auditor finds instances of short payment of duty or non-observance of Central excise procedures, he is required to discuss the issue with the assessee. After explanation provided by the assessee, if the auditor is satisfied that such non-tax compliance has occurred, he records the same as an 'Audit Objection' or 'Audit Para' of the 'draft audit report' that he would be preparing at the end of the verification process. Auditor is advised not to take formal objections to mere procedural lapses/ infractions/ adoption of wrong procedures, which do not result in any short payment of duty or do not have bearing upon the duty payment. In such cases the auditor is required to discuss the matter with the assessee and advise him to follow the correct procedure in future. Further, while making an audit para, attempt should be made to tabulate the duty short paid by the assessee at the spot and incorporate it in the para itself. However, if this is not possible for the paucity of time or for the want of some information not available at that time, the auditor should make a note of the same in his report. 3.8 Audit Report 3.8.1 At the end of the process of verification the auditor prepares an 'Draft Audit Report' which incorporates all the audit objections/audit paras. An audit report provides (issue or para wise) the issue in brief, the reply or the explanation of the assessee, the reason for the auditor not being satisfied with the reply, the amount of short payment (if tabulated) and the recoveries of the same (if could be made at the spot). The draft audit report is then submitted to the superior officers for review, who examine the sustainability of the objections raised by the auditors. After such review, the audit report becomes final and in cases where the disputed amounts have not already been paid by the assessee at the spot, demand notices are issued by the department for their recoveries.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 4--> 4.1 EA 2000 is a modern, transparent and interactive method of audit wherein the auditor proceeds with audit fully conversant with the business of the assessee. On his part, the assessee is given full opportunity to explain his stand on any particular matter so that matters are resolved in full appreciation of legal position. EA 2000 is thus a participative audit. 4.2 A requirement of EA 2000 is that the auditors must be thorough in their knowledge of Central Excise law and procedures, notifications, instructions and circulars issued by the Finance Ministry and the judicial decisions on issues relating to central excise laws. To be successful auditor, knowledge about financial bookkeeping, accountancy and proficiency in understanding commonly used commercial books and documents is of great help. Further, being computer literate is an added requirement while auditing an assessee who maintains his accounts in electronic format.

Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Provisions of search and seizure are used by the Central Excise Officers to enforce the provision of the Central Excise Law. These provisions are used as an exception when the direct physical intervention becomes necessary. At the same time the search and seizure is to be done in accordance with the laid down law. In this regard reference is to be made to the applicable provisions of other statutes, i.e. Code of Criminal Procedure .
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 The provisions relating to search are given in Section 18 of the Act,1944, which provides that all searches should be made in accordance with the provisions of the 								Code of Criminal Procedure							 . 2.2 Rules 22 23 of the 								Central Excise (No.2) Rules, 2001 							 (hereinafter referred to as the said Rules), empower the authorized officer to enter and search any premises, conveyance or other place. 							Further, rule 24 ibid specifically empowers such officer to effect a seizure or detention. 							Moreover, Section 12 of the 								Central Excise Act, 1944							 , empowers the Central Government to apply the provisions of the 								Customs Act							 to the Central Excise also. 							In exercise of such powers the Central Government has issued Notification No.68/63, dated 4.5.1963 modifying and extending the various sections of 								Customs Act, 1962							 to Central Excise matters. 2.3 In terms of the said rules, an officer not below the rank of the Inspector of Central Excise, duly authorized by Commissioner by special or general order, can search at any time, any premises or conveyance where he has reason to believe that excisable goods are manufactured, stored or carried in contravention of the provisions of the Act or rules. 							For a registered premises or for stopping and searching any conveyance in transit no search warrant is required. 							However, in other cases, normally search warrants are issued by the Deputy/Assistant Commissioner authorizing the search. 							The Central Excise Officer is also authorized to stop and search any conveyance as well. 							The search is to be carried out in the presence of two independent witnesses. 2.4 Section 22 deals with vexatious searches, seizure etc. by Central Excise Officers. 							In such case the Central Excise office will be liable to punishment under the law. 							Similar provision is made applicable to any person wilfully and malaciously giving false information leading to vexatious search.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 3--> 3.1 Rule 24 of the said Rules provides for power to detain goods or seize the excisable goods. If a Central Excise Officer, has reason to believe that any goods, which are liable to excise duty but no duty has been paid thereon or the said goods were removed with the intention of evading the duty payable thereon, the Central Excise Officer may detain or seize such goods. 3.2 The power to release seized goods emanates from power to seize itself. The goods seized may be released provisionally under bond in the Format specified under erstwhile Central Excise Rules, 1944 [B-8 bond] along with 25% security or surety by the officer who is normally competent to adjudicate the case. The adjudicating officer will also consider the importance of such goods for evidence, and will release the goods provisionally if the bond is furnished. Wherever necessary, sample may also be drawn. The adjudicating officer, however, will ask the owner or in-charge of the goods to whom the goods were released provisionally to produce the goods any time before the issue of adjudication order, if he is of the view that the goods are liable for confiscation. In case the person to whom goods were released provisionally fails to produce the goods at appointed time, the bond may be enforced for recovering.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 1--> 1.1 Provisions for arrest are contained in Sections 13 and 18 of Central Excise Act, 1944These provisions provide for power to arrest, searches and arrests how to be made, disposal of persons arrested, procedure to be followed. 1.2 Any Central Excise Officer not below the rank of Inspector can arrest any person under Section 13 whom he has reason to believe that he is liable to punishment under the Central Excise ActIn normal circumstances, prior approval of Commissioner will be taken before arresting a person. 1.3 The arrested person shall be produced before the Jurisdictional Magistrate or the Chief Judicial Magistrate, as the case may be, within twenty-four hours of the arrest. 1.4 Power to grant bail is normally to be exercised by a Jurisdictional Magistrate.
Central Excise Manual, 2001_Section 2--> 2.1 Besides the departmental adjudication, prosecution may also be launched under Section 9 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 for the offences under Section 9(1) of the Act.
