Central Excise Tariff (Amendment) Act, 2004_Section 3--> For the First Schedule and the Second Schedule to the principal Act, the following Schedules shall be substituted, namely:- THE FIRST SCHEDULE --EXCISE TARIFF (See section 2) General rules for the interpretation of this Schedule Classification of goods in this Schedule shall be governed by the following principles: 1. The titles of Sections, Chapters and Sub-Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes and, provided such headings or Notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions. 2. (a) Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rule), presented unassembled or disassembled. (b) Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of rule 3. 3. When by application of rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows: (a) the heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods. (b) mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to (a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion is applicable. (c) when goods cannot be classified by reference to (a) or (b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration. 4. Goods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin. 5. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein: (a) camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing instrument cases, necklace cases and similar containers, specially shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. This rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole its essential character; (b) subject to the provisions of (a) above, packing materials and packing containers presented with the goods therein shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, this provision does not apply when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use. 6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the sub-headings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those sub-headings and any related sub-heading Notes and, mutatis mutandis, to the above rules, on the under standing that only sub-headings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of this rule the relative Section and Chapter Notes also apply, unless the context otherwise requires. General Explanatory Notes 1. Where in column (2) of this Schedule, the description of an article or group of articles under a heading is preceded by "-", the said article or group of articles shall be taken to be a sub-classification of the article or group of articles covered by the said heading. Where, however, the description of an article or group of articles is preceded by "--", the said article or group of articles shall be taken to be a sub-classification of the immediately preceding description of the article or group of articles which has "-". Where the description of an article or group of articles is preceded by "---" or "----", the said article or group of articles shall be taken to be a sub-classification of the immediately preceding description of the article or group of articles which has "-" or "--". 2. The abbreviation "%" in column (4) of this Schedule in relation to the rate of duty indicates that duty on the goods to which the entry relates shall be charged on the basis of the value of the goods fixed, defined or deemed to be, as the case may be, under or in sub-section (2) read with sub-section (3) of section 3 or section 4 or section 4Aof the Central Excise Act, 1944 (1 of 1994), the duty being equal to such percentage of the value as is indicated in that column. Additional Notes In this Schedule,- (1)(a) "heading", in respect of goods, means a description in list of tariff provisions accompanied by a four-digit number and includes all sub-headings of tariff items the first four-digits of which correspond to that number; (b) "sub-heading", in respect of goods, means a description in the list of tariff provisions accompanied by a six-digit number and includes all tariff items the first six-digits of which correspond to that number; (c) "tariff item" means a description of goods in the list of tariff provisions accompanying either eight-digit number and the rate of the duty of excise or eight- digit number with blank in the column of the rate of duty; (2) the list of tariff provisions is divided into Sections, Chapters and Sub-Chapters; (3) in column (3), the standard unit of quantity is specified for each tariff item to facilitate the collection, comparison and analysis of trade statistics.

Chapter 27 MINERAL FUELS, MINERAL OILS AND PRODUCTS OF THEIR DISTILLATION; BITUMINOUS SUBSTANCES; MINERAL WAXES NOTES 1. This Chapter does not cover: (a) separate chemically defined organic compounds other than pure methane and propane which are to be classified in heading 2711; (b) medicaments of heading 3003 or 3004; or (c) mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons of heading 3301, 3302 or 3805. 2. References in heading 2710 to "petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals" include not only petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals but also similar oils, as well as those consisting mainly of mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons, obtained by any process, provided that the weight of the non-aromatic constituents exceeds that of the aromatic constituents. However, the references do not include liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60% by volume distils at 300C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (Chapter 39). 3. For the purposes of heading 2710, "waste oils" means waste containing mainly petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (as described in Note 2 to this Chapter), whether or not mixed with water. These include: (a) such oils no longer fit for use as primary products (for example, used lubricating oils, used hydraulic oils and used transformer oils); (b) sludge oils from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, mainly containing such oils and high concentration of additives (for example, chemicals) used in the manufacture of the primary products; and (c) such oils in the form of emulsions in water or mixtures with water, such as those resulting from oil spills, storage tank washings, or from the use of cutting oils for machining operations. 4. In relation to lubricating oils and lubricating preprations of heading 2710, labelling or relabelling of containers and repacking from bulk packs to retail packs or the adoption of any other treatment to render the product marketable to the consumer, shall amount to 'manufacture'. 5. In relation to natural gas falling under heading 2711, the process of compression of natural gas (even if it does not involve liquefaction), for the purpose of marketing it as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), for use as a fuel or for any other purpose, shall amount to 'manufacture'. SUB-HEADING NOTES 1. For the purposes of sub-heading 2701 11 "anthracite" means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral-matter-free basis) not exceeding 14%. 2. For the purposes of sub-heading 2701 12, "bituminous coal" means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral-matter-free basis) exceeding 14% and a calorific value limit (on a moist, mineral-matter-free basis) equal to or greater than 5,833 Kcal/Kg. 3. For the purposes of sub-headings 2707 10, 2707 20, 2707 30, 2707 40 and 2707 60, the terms "benzol (benzene)", "toluol (toluene)", "xylol (xylenes)", "naphthalene" or "phenols" apply to products which contain more than 50% by weight of benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene or phenols, respectively. 4.

The term "isotopes", for the purposes of this Note and of the wording of headings 2844 and 2845, refers to: (i) individual nuclides, excluding, however, those existing in nature in the monoisotopic state; (ii) mixtures of isotopes of one and the same element, enriched in one or several of the said isotopes, that is, elements of which the natural isotopic composition has been artificially modified. Heading 2848 includes copper phosphide (phospher copper) containing more than 15% by weight of phosphorus. Chemical elements (for example, silicon and selenium) doped for use in electronics are to be classified in this Chapter, provided that they are in forms unworked as drawn, or in the form of cylinders or rods. When cut in the forms of discs, wafers or similar forms, they fall in heading 3818. In relation to products of this Chapter, labelling or relabelling of containers and repacking from bulk packs to retail packs or the adoption of any other treatment to render the product marketable to the consumer, shall amount to 'manufacture'. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE Sub-heading 280440 includes, liquefied or solidified gas.

Except where the context otherwise requires, the headings of this Chapter apply only to : (a) separate chemically defined organic compounds, whether or not containing impurities; (b) mixtures of two or more isomers of the same organic compound (whether or not containing impurities), except mixtures of acyclic hydrocarbon isomers (other than stereoisomers), whether or not saturated (Chapter 27); (c) the products of headings 2936 to 2939 or the sugar ethers, sugar acetals and sugar esters, and their salts, of heading 2940, or the products of heading 2941, whether or not chemically defined; (d) the products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above dissolved in water; (e) the products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above dissolved in other solvents provided that the solution constitutes a normal and necessary method of putting up these products adopted solely for reasons of safety or for transport and that the solvent does not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use; (f) the products mentioned in (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above with an added stabi-liser (including an anti-caking agent) necessary for their preservation or transport; (g) the products mentioned in (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) above with an added anti-dusting agent or a colouring or odoriferous substance added to facilitate their identi-fication or for safety reasons, provided that the additions do not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use; (h) the following products, diluted to standard strengths, for the production of azo dye: diazonium salts, couplers used for these salts and diazotisable amines and their salts. 2. This Chapter does not cover : (a) goods of heading 1504 or crude glycerol of heading 1520; (b) ethyl alcohol (Chapter 22); (c) methane or propane (heading 2711); (d) the compounds of carbon mentioned in Note 2 to Chapter 28; (e) urea (heading 3102 or 3105); (f) colouring matter of vegetable or animal origin (heading 3203), synthetic or-ganic colouring matter, synthetic organic products of a kind used as fluorescent bright-ening agents or as luminophores (heading 3204) or dyes or other colouring matter put up in forms or packings for retail sale (heading 3212); (g) enzymes (heading 3507); (h) metaldehyde, hexamethylenetetramine or similar substances, put up in forms (for example, tablets, sticks or similar forms) for use as fuels or liquid or liquefied-gas fuels in containers of a kind used for filling or refilling cigarette or similar lighters and of a capacity not exceeding 300 cm3 (heading 3606); (ij) products put up as charges for fire-extinguishers or put up in fire-extinguish-ing grenades, of heading 3813; ink removers put up in packing for retail sale, of head-ing 3824; or (k) optical elements, for example, of ethylenediamine tartrate (heading 9001). 1.Goods which could be included in two or more of the headings of this Chapter are to be classified in that one of those headings which occurs last in numerical order. 2. In headings 2904 to 2906, 2908 to 2911 and 2913 to 2920, any reference to halogenated, sulphonated, nitrated or nitrosated derivatives includes a reference to compound derivatives, such as sulphohalogenated, nitrohalogenated, nitrosulphonated or nitrosulphohalogenated derivatives. Nitro or nitroso groups are not to be taken as "nitrogen-functions" for the purposes of heading 2929. For the purposes of headings 2911, 2912, 2914, 2918 and 2922, "oxygen-functions" is to be restricted to the functions (the characteristic organic oxygen-containing groups) referred to in headings 2905 to 2920. 5. (a) The esters of acid-function organic compounds of Sub-Chapters I to VII with organic compounds of these Sub-Chapters are to be classified with that compound which is classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order in these Sub-Chapters. (b) Esters of ethyl alcohol with acid-function organic compounds of Sub-Chapters I to VII are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acid-function compounds. (c) Subject to Note 1 to Section VI and Note 2 to Chapter 28 : (A) inorganic salts of organic compounds such as acid-, phenol-or enol-function compounds or organic bases, of Sub-Chapters I to X or heading 2942, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the organic compound; and (B) salts formed between organic compounds of Sub-Chapters I to X or heading 2942 are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the base or to the acid (including phenol- or enol- function compounds) from which they are formed, whichever occurs last in numerical order in the Chapter. (d) Metal alcoholates are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding alcohols except in the case of ethanol (heading 2905). (e) Halides of carboxylic acids are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acids. 6. The compounds of headings 2930 and 2931 are organic compounds the molecules of which contain, in addition to atoms of hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen, atoms of other non-metals or of metals (such as sulphur, arsenic, mercury or lead) directly linked to carbon atoms. Heading 2930 (organo-sulphur compounds) and heading 2931 (other organo-inorganic compounds) do not include sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (including compound derivatives) which, apart from hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, only have directly linked to carbon the atoms of sulphur or of a halogen which give them their nature of sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (or compound derivatives). Headings 2932, 2933 and 2934 do not include epoxides with a three-membered ring, ketone peroxides, cyclic polymers of aldehydes or of thioaldehydes anhydrides of polybasic carboxylic acids, cyclic esters of polyhydric alcohols or phenols with polybasic acids or imides of polybasic acids. These provisions apply only when the ring-position hetero-atoms are those resulting solely from the cyclising funct ion or functions here listed. 8. For the purpose of heading 2937 : (a) the term "hormones" includes hormone-releasing or hormone-stimulating factors, hormone inhibitors and hormone antagonists (anti-hormones); (b) the expression "used primarily as hormones" applies not only to hormone derivatives and structural analogues used primarily for their hormonal effect, but also to those derivatives and structural analogues used primarily as intermediates in the synthesis of products of this heading. This Chapter does not cover products containing alcohol, opium, Indian hemp or other narcotic drugs. For the purposes of this Note, "alcohol", "opium", "Indian hemp", "narcotic drugs" and "narcotics" have the meanings assigned to them in section 2 of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955 (16 of 1955). In relation to products of this Chapter, labelling or relabelling of containers and repacking from bulk packs to retail packs or the adoption of any other treatment to render the product marketable to the consumer, shall amount to 'manufacture'. Sub-heading Note Within any one heading of this Chapter, derivatives of a chemical compound (or group of chemical compounds) are to be classified in the same sub-heading as that compound (or group of compounds) provided that they are not more specially covered by any other sub-heading and that there is no residual sub-heading named "other" in the series of sub-headings concerned.

Goods put up in sets consisting of two or more separate constituents, some or all of which fall in this Section and are intended to be mixed together to obtain a product of Section VI or VII, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to that product, provided that the constituents are: (a) having regard to the manner in which they are put up, clearly identifiable as being intended to be used together without first being repacked; (b) presented together; and (c) identifiable, whether by their nature or by the relative proportions in which they are present, as being complementary one to another. 2. Except for the goods of heading 3918 or 3919, plastics, rubber, and articles thereof, printed with motifs, characters or pictorial representations, which are not merely incidental to the primary use of the goods, fall in Chapter 49. Chapter 39 PLASTICS AND ARTICLES THEREOF NOTES 1. Throughout this Schedule, the expression "plastics" means those materials of headings 3901 to 3914 which are or have been capable, either at the moment of polymerisation or at some subsequent stage, of being formed under external influence (usually heat and pressure, if necessary with a solvent or plasticiser) by moulding, casting, extruding, rolling or other process into shapes which are retained on the removal of the external influence. Throughout this Schedule any reference to "plastics" also includes vulcanised fibre. The expression, however, does not apply to materials regarded as textile materials of Section XI. 2. This Chapter does not cover: (a) waxes of heading 2712 or 3404; (b) separate chemically defined organic compounds (Chapter 29); (c) heparin or its salts (heading 3001); (d) solutions (other than collodions) consisting of any of the products specified in headings 3901 to 3913 in volatile organic solvents when the weight of the solvent exceeds 16% of the weight of the solution (heading 3208); stamping foils of heading 3212; (e) organic surface-active agents or preparation of heading 3402; (f) run gums or ester gums (heading 3806); (g) diagnostic or laboratory reagents on a backing of plastics (heading 3822); (h) synthetic rubber, as defined for the purpose of Chapter 40, or articles thereof; (ij) saddlery or harness (heading 4201) or trunks, suit-cases, hand-bags or other containers of heading 4202; (k) plaits, wickerwork or other articles of Chapter 46; (l) wall coverings of heading 4814; (m) goods of Section XI (textiles and textile articles); (n) articles of Section XII (for example, footwear, headgear, umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops or parts thereof); (o) imitation jewellery of heading 7117; (p) articles of Section XVI (machines and mechanical or electrical appliances); (q) parts of aircraft or vehicles of Section XVII; (r) articles of Chapter 90 (for example, optical elements, spectacle frames, drawing instruments); (s) articles of Chapter 91 (for example, clock or watch cases); (t) articles of Chapter 92 (for example, musical instruments or parts thereof); (u) articles of Chapter 94 (for example, furniture, lamps and lighting fittings, illuminated signs, prefabricated buildings); (v) articles of Chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports requisites); or (w) articles of Chapter 96 (for example, brushes, buttons, slide fasteners, combs, mouth-pieces or stems for smoking pipes, cigarette-holders or the like, parts of vacuum flasks or the like, pens, propelling pencils). 3. Headings 3901 to 3911 apply only to goods of a kind produced by chemical synthesis, falling in the following categories: (a) liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60% by volume distils at 300C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced pressure distillation method is used (headings 3901 and 3902); (b) resins, not highly polymerised, of the coumarone-indene type (heading 3911); (c) other synthetic polymers with an average of at least 5 monomer units; (d) silicones (heading 3910); (e) resols (heading 3909) and other prepolymers. 4. The expression "copolymers" covers all polymers in which no single monomer unit contributes 95% or more by weight to the total polymer content. For the purposes of this Chapter, except where the context otherwise requires, copolymers (including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copolymers and graft copolymers) and polymer bends are to be classified in the heading covering polymers of that comonomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For the purposes of this Note, constituent comonomer units of polymers falling in the same heading shall be taken together. If no single comonomer unit predominates, copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration. 5. Chemically modified polymers, that is those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. This provision does not apply to graft copolymers. 6. In headings 3901 to 3914, the expression "primary forms" applies only to the following forms: (a) liquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions; (b) blocks of irregular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms. 7. Heading 3915 does not apply to waste, parings and scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms (headings 3901 to 3914). 8. For the purposes of heading 3917, the expression "tubes, pipes and hoses" means hollow products, whether semi-manufactures or finished products, of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting or distributing gases or liquids (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes). This expression also includes sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last-mentioned, those having an internal cross-section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed 1.5 times the width) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes. 9. For the purposes of heading 3918, the expression "wall or ceiling coverings of plastics" applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated. 10. In headings 3920 and 3921, the expression "plates, sheets, film, foil and strip" applies only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so cut they become articles ready for use). 11. Heading 3925 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier headings of Sub-Chapter II: (a) reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300l; (b) structural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs; (c) gutters and fittings thereof; (d) doors, windows and their frames and thresholds for doors; (e) balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers; (f) shutters, blinds (including Venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof; (g) large scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses; (h) ornamental architectural features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes; and (ij) fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch-plates and other protective plates. 12. In headings 3920 and 3921, the expression "flexible" means an article which has a modulus of elasticity either in flexture or in tension of not over 700 kilograms per square centimeter at 23C and 50 per cent. relative humidity when tested in accordance with the method of test for stiffness of plastics (ASTM Designation D-747-63), for flexural properties of plastics (ASTM Designation D-790-63), for tensile properties of plastics (ASTM Designation D-638-64T), or for tensile properties of thin plastic sheeting (ASTM Designation D-882-64T) and "rigid" means all articles other than 'flexible' as defined above. 13. Notwithstanding anything contained in Note 12 to this Chapter, in headings 3909, 3921, 3923, 3924, 3925 and 3926 "rigid ployurethane foam" means cellular polyurethane with compressive strength of 0.418 to 28.14 kg./Cm2and flexural strength of 1.05 to 28.14 kg./Cm2when tested in accordance with American Standard (Designation ASTM-D-2341). 14. For the purposes of headings 3919, 3920 and 3921, the expression "film" means sheetings of thickness not exceeding 0.25 millimetres. 15. For the purposes of this Chapter, "insulated ware" shall mean any multi-walled or multi-layered article intended to provide thermal insulation. SUB-HEADING NOTES 1. Within any one heading of this Chapter, polymers (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are to be classified according to the following provisions: (a) where there is a sub-heading named "Other" in the same series: (1) the designation in a sub-heading of a polymer by the prefix "poly" (e.g., polyethylene and polyamide -6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content; (2) the copolymers named in sub-hea dings 3901 30, 3903 20, 3903 30 and 3904 30 are to be classified in those sub-headings, provided that the comonomer units of the named copolymers contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content; (3) chemically modified polymer are to be classified in the sub-heading named "Other", provided that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by any other sub-heading; (4) polymers not meeting (1), (2) or (3) above, are to be classified in the sub-heading, among the remaining sub-headings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same sub-heading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of sub-headings under consideration are to be compared; (b) where there is no sub-heading named "Other" in the same series: (1) polymers are to be classified in the sub-heading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same sub-heading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared; (2) chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the sub-heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer.

Except where the context otherwise requires, throughout this Schedule, the expression "rubber" means the following products, whether or not vulcanised or hard: natural rubber, balata, gutta-percha, guayule, chicle and similar natural gums, synthetic rubber, factice derived from oils, and such substances reclaimed. 2. This Chapter does not cover: (a) goods of Section XI (textiles and textile articles); (b) footwear or parts thereof of Chapter 64; (c) headgear or parts thereof (including bathing caps) of Chapter 65; (d) mechanical or electrical appliances or parts thereof of Section XVI (including electrical goods of all kinds), of hard rubber; (e) articles of Chapter 90,92,94 or 96; or (f) articles of Chapter 95 (other than sports gloves, mittens and mitts and articles of headings 4011 to 4013). 3. In headings 4001 to 4003 and 4005, the expression "primary forms" applies only to the following forms: (a) liquids and pastes (including latex, whether or not pre-vulcanised, and other dispersions and solutions); (b) blocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules, crumbs and similar bulk forms. 4. In Note 1 to this Chapter and in heading 4002, the expression "synthetic rubber" applies to: (a) unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanisation with sulphur into non-thermoplastic substances which, at a temperature between 18C and 29C, will not break on being extended to three times their original length and will return, after being extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not greater than one and a half times their original length. For the purposes of this test, substances necessary for the cross-linking, such as vulcanising activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances as provided for by Note 5(b)(ii) and (iii) is also permitted. However, the presence of any substances not necessary for the cross-linking, such as extenders, plasticisers and fillers, is not permitted; (b) thioplasts (TM); and (c) natural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with plastics, depolymerised natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated synthetic substances with saturated synthetic high polymers provided that all the above-mentioned products comply with the requirements concerning vulcanisation, elongation and recovery in (a) above. 5. (a) Headings 4001 and 4002 do not apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, before or after coagulation, with: (i) vulcanising agents, accelerators, retarders or activators (other than those added for the preparation of pre-vulcanised rubber latex); (ii) pigments or other colouring matter, other than those added solely for the purpose of identification; (iii) plasticisers or extenders (except mineral oil in the case of oil-extended rubber), fillers, reinforcing agents, organic solvents or any other substances, except those permitted under (b); (b) the presence of the following substances in any rubber or mixture of rubbers shall not affect its classification in heading 4001 or 4002, as the case may be, provided that such rubber or mixture of rubbers retains its essential character as a raw material: (i) emulsifiers or anti-tack agents; (ii) small amounts of breakdown products of emulsifiers; (iii) very small amounts of the following: heat-sensitive agents (generally for obtaining thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active agents (generally for obtaining electropositive rubber latexes), anti-oxidants, coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptisers, preservatives, vulcanised, viscosity-control agents, or similar special-purpose additives. 6. For the purposes of heading 4004, the expression "waste, parings and scrap" means rubber waste, parings and scrap from the manufacture or working of rubber and rubber goods definitely not usable as such because of cutting-up, wear or other reasons. 7. Thread wholly of vulcanized rubber, of which any cross-sectional dimension exceeds 5 mm, is to be classified as strip, rods or profile shapes, of heading 4008. 8. Heading 4010 includes conveyor or transmission belts or belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with rubber or made from textile yarn or cord impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber. 9. In headings 4001, 4002, 4003, 4005 and 4008, the expressions "plates", "sheets" and "strip" apply only to plates, sheets and strip and to blocks of regular geometric shape, uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether or not having the character of articles and whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, but not otherwise cut to shape or further worked. In heading 4008, the expressions "rods" and "profile shapes" apply only to such products, whether or not cut to length or surface-worked but not otherwise worked. SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES 1. For the purposes of headings 4009 and 4010, while calculating the percentage of rubber compound contents, the weight of canvas, yarn, metallic wires, washers, rivets and the like, where such products, form integral part of ingredient of such rubber products, shall be taken into account, but the weight of metallic fitments and surface finishing necessary to make the belting and tubing suitable for particular end uses, shall be ignored. 2. Tariff item 4008 2110 shall also apply to "plates", "sheets", and "strips", whether or not cut to shape and surface-worked or further worked so as to render them fit for resoling or repairing or re-treading of rubber tyres.

(d) COLOURED (DYED OR PRINTED) YARN Yarn which: (i) is dyed (whether or not in the mass) other than white or in a fugitive colour, or printed, or made from dyed or printed fibres; (ii) consists of a mixture of dyed fibres of different colours or of a mixture of unbleached or bleached fibres with coloured fibres (marl or mixture yarns), or is printed in one or more colours at intervals to give the impression of dots; (iii) is obtained from silvers or rovings which have been printed; or (iv) is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured yarn. The above definitions also apply, mutatis mutandis, to monofilament and to strip or the like of Chapter 54. (e) UNBLEACHED WOVEN FABRIC Woven fabric made from unbleached yarn and which has not been bleached, dyed or printed. Such fabric may have been treated with a colourless dressing or a fugitive dye. (f) BLEACHED WOVEN FABRIC Woven fabric which: (i) has been bleached or, unless the context otherwise requires, dyed white or treated with a white dressing, in the piece; (ii) consists of bleached yarn; or (iii) consists of unbleached and bleached yarn. (g) DYED WOVEN FABRIC Woven fabric which: (i) is dyed a single uniform colour other than white (unless the context otherwise requires) or has been treated with a coloured finish other than white (unless the context otherwise requires), in the piece; or (ii) consists of coloured yarn of a single uniform colour. (h) WOVEN FABRIC OF YARNS OF DIFFERENT COLOURS Woven fabric (other than printed woven fabric) which: (i) consists of yarns of different colours or yarns of different shades of the same colour (other than the natural colour of the constituent fibres); (ii) consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured yarn; or (iii) consists of marl or mixture yarns. (In all cases, the yarn used in selvedges and piece ends is not taken into consideration). (ij) PRINTED WOVEN FABRIC Woven fabric which has been printed in the piece, whether or not made from yarns of different colours. (The following are also regarded as printed woven fabrics: Woven fabrics bearing designs made, for example, with a brush or spray gun, by means of transfer paper, by flocking or by the batik process). The process of mercerisation does not affect the classification of yarns or fabrics within the above categories. The definitions at (e) to (ij) above apply, mutatis mutandis, to knitted or crocheted fabrics. (k) PLAIN WEAVE A fabric construction in which each yarn of the weft passes alternately over and under successive yarns of the warp and each yarn of the warp passes alternatively over and under successive yarns of the weft. 2. (A) Products of Chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting wholly of that textile material which would be selected under Note 2 to this Section for the classification of a product of Chapters 50 to 55 or of heading 5809 consisting of the same textile materials. (B) For the application of this rule: (a) where appropriate, only the part which determines, the classification under Interpretative Rule 3 shall be taken into account; (b) in the case of textile products consisting of a ground fabric and a pile or looped surface no account shall be taken of the ground fabric; (c) in the case of embroidery of heading 5810 and goods thereof, only the ground fabric shall be taken into account. However, embroidery without visible ground, and goods thereof, shall be classified with reference to the embroidering threads alone.
