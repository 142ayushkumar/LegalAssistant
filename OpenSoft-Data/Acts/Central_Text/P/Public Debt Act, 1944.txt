The working of this Act disclosed certain defects and it was considered necessary to amend it, particularly in the context of the very large increase of the public debt during the war years. Under the Government of India Act, 1935 , the Central Legislature was competent to change only the law in respect of central securities and the provisions of the Indian Securities Act , were accordingly replaced, so far as the Central public debt was concerned, by a comprehensive new Act, the Public debt (Central Government) Act, 1944 , which was brought into effect from the 1st May, 1946 leaving the Provincial securities to be regulated by the Indian Securities Act, 1920As the money market is common to the whole country and the public debt of the Central and Provincial Governments is administered by a single agency namely, the Reserve Bank, it is obviously desirable to have uniform legislation for regulating the public debt of both. The Provincial Governments concur in this view and the Chambers of the Legislatures of all the Provinces in India have passed resolutions recommending that the securities issued by their respective Governments and their public debt should be regulated by an Act of the Dominion Legislature. It is accordingly proposed to amend the public Debt (Central Government) Act so as to extend it to cover the public debt of all the Provincial Governments".- Amendment Act 57 of 1956 .-- "The public debt and securities of the Union and Part A States are at present administered by the Reserve Bank of India in accordance with the Public Debt Act, 1944 , and the rules made thereunder. The Act at present does not extend to securities created and issued by the Governments of Part B States. Some of these States have their own Public Debt laws while others have acquired public debt only recently and have no regular law on the subject. Securities issued by the Governments of Part B States are circulating in all parts of the country and the public debt of Part B States is also being administered by the Reserve Bank of India. It is, therefore, desirable that there should be uniformity of procedure in respect of the public debt of the Union and all Part A and Part B States and that the Public Debt Act, 1944 should apply to securities issued by the Government of Part B States as it applies to securities issued by the Central Government or a Part A State. The Legislatures of Part B States other than that of the State of Jammu and Kashmir have passed resolutions in pursuance of Article 252 of the Constitution empowering Parliament to pass the necessary legislation on the subject. The Bill, accordingly amends the Public Debt Act, 1944 , so as to make it applicable to securities issued by the Governments of Part B States other than the Government of Jammu and Kashmir and makes certain other minor and incidental amendments in that Act". Amendment Act 44 of 1959 .-- "Ten-Year Treasury Savings Deposit Certificates and 15-Year Annuity Certificates which are sold and discharged through the Reserve Bank of India are governed by the provisions of the Public Debt Act, 1944 Section 7 of that Act provides that if the face value of the Government securities belonging to a deceased holder exceeds Rs. 5,000, the executors or administrators of the deceased holder and the holder of a succession certificate shall be the only persons who may be recognised by the Reserve Bank as having any title of these securities. 2. Suggestions have been made from time to time that as the production of legal proof of succession involves considerable delay and expense, the holders of Ten-year Treasury Savings Deposit Certificates and 15-Year Annuity Certificates may be allowed the right to nominate a person or persons to whom the amount due on the certificate could be paid in the event of the death of the holders without the production of succession certificate or other proof of title. This Bill accordingly seeks to allow the facility of nomination to holders of the aforementioned certificates." Amending Act 44 of 1972 .-- The public debt and the securities of the Central and State Governments, other than the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, are at present administered by the Reserve Bank of India in accordance with the provisions of the Public Debt Act, 1944 . and the rules made thereunder. In 1956, the Legislatures of the erstwhile Part B States, other Legislatures of the erstwhile Part B States, other than that of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, passed resolutions in pursuance of Article 252(1) of the Constitution empowering Parliament to amend the Public Debt Act, 1944 , so as to make it applicable to securities issued by the Governments to those States and to their public debt. The Government of Jammu and Kashmir proposes to raise public loans from this year for augmenting resources for financing its developmental outlays and has requested that the Public Debt Act, 1944 may be made applicable to securities to be issued by it and to its public debt. The Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council of the State of Jammu and Kashmir have passed resolutions in pursuance of Article 252(1) of the Constitution empowering Parliament to amend the Public Debt Act, 1944 , with a view to make the provisions thereof applicable to securities issued by the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and to its public debt. The Bill seeks to amend the Public Debt Act, 1944 for the aforesaid purpose. Inserted by the Public Debt (Amendment) Act, 1972 (44 of 1972), section 5 (w.r.e.f. 1-9-1972).
