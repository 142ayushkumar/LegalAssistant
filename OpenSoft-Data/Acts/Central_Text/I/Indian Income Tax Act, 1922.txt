(2) The reference in sub-section (1) to buying back or re-acquiring the securities shall be deemed to include references to buying or acquiring similar securities so, however, that where similar securities are bought or acquired, the owner shall be under no greater liability to tax than he would have been under if the original securities had been bought back or re-acquired.

(3) For the purposes of assessment to income-tax or super-tax in the case of any such person, the income from any securities to which this sub-section applies shall be deemed to accrue from day to day, and in the case of the sale or transfer of any such securities by or to him shall be deemed to have been received as and when it is deemed to have accrued: Provided that this section shall not apply if such person proves to the satisfaction of the Income-tax Officer that the avoidance of income-tax or super-tax was exceptional and not systematic and that there was not in his case in any of the three preceding years any such avoidance of income-tax or super-tax, or that the provisions of section 44E have been applied in his case in respect of such income. (4) If any person fails to furnish any statement or particulars required under this section, or if the Income-tax Officer is not satisfied with any statement or particulars furnished under this section, the Income-tax Officer may make an estimate of the amount of the income which, under the foregoing provisions of this section, is to be deemed to form part of the person's total income for the purposes of income-tax or super-tax.

Explanation. For the purposes of this section income shall be deemed to have been brought into the taxable territories if it has been utilised or could have been utilised for the purposes of any expenditure actually incurred by the assessee without the taxable territories or if the income whether capitalised or not has been brought into the taxable territories in any form.
Indian Income Tax Act, 1922_Section 46--> (1) When an assessee is in default in making a payment of income-tax, the Income-tax Officer may in his discretion direct that, in addition to the amount of the arrears, a sum not exceeding that amount shall be recovered from the assessee by way of penalty. (1A) For the purposes of sub-section (1), the Income-tax Officer may direct the recovery of any sum less than the amount of the arrears and may enhance the sum so directed to be recovered from time to time in the case of a continuing default, so however that the total sum so directed to be recovered shall not exceed the amount of the arrears payable.

(b) a civil court has under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), for the purpose of the recovery of an amount due under a decree. (3) In any area with respect to which the Commissioner has directed that any arrears may be recovered by any process enforceable for the recovery of an arrear of any municipal tax or local rate imposed under any enactment for the time being in force in any part of the State, the Income-tax Officer may proceed to recover the amount due by such process. (4) The Commissioner may direct by what authority any powers or duties incident under any such enactment as aforesaid to the enforcement of any process for the recovery of a municipal tax or local rate shall be exercised or performed when that process is employed under sub-section (3). (5) If any assessee is in receipt of any income chargeable under the head "Salaries" the Income-tax Officer may require any person paying the same to deduct from any payment subsequent to the date of such requisition any arrears due from such assessee, and such person shall comply with any such requisition, and shall pay the sum so deducted to the credit of the Central Government, or as the Central Board of Revenue directs.

The Income-tax Officer may at any time or from time to time amend or revoke any such notice or extend the time for making any payment in pursuance of the notice. Any person making any payment in compliance with a notice under this sub-section shall be deemed to have made the payment under the authority of the assessee and the receipt of the Income-tax Officer shall constitute a good and sufficient discharge of the liability of such person to the assessee to the extent of the amount referred to in the receipt. Any person discharging any liability to the assessee after receipt of the notice referred to in this sub-section shall be personally liable to the Income-tax Officer to the extent of the liability discharged or to the extent of the liability of the assessee for tax and penalties, whichever is less. If the persgn to whom a notice under this sub-section is sent fails to make payment in pursuance thereof to the Income-tax Officer, further proceedings may be taken by and before the Collector on the footing that the Income-tax Officer's notice has the same effect as an attachment by the Collector in exercise of his powers under the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 46. Where a person to whom a notice under this sub-section is sent objects to it on the ground that the sum demanded or any part thereof is not due to the assessee or that he does not hold any money for or on account of the assessee, then, nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to require such person to pay any such sum or part thereof, as the case may be, to the Income-tax Officer. (6) If the recovery of income-tax in any area has been entrusted to a State Government under article 258(1) of the Constitution , the State Government may direct with respect to that area or any part thereof, that income-tax shall be recovered therein with, and as an addition to, any municipal tax or local rate, by the same person and in the same manner as the municipal tax or local rate is recovered.

Explanation. A proceeding for the recovery of any sum shall be deemed to have commenced within the meaning of this section, if some action is taken to recover the whole or any part of the sum within the period hereinbefore referred to, and for the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that the several modes of recovery specified in this section are neither mutually exclusive, nor affect in any way any other law for the time being in force relating to the recovery of debts due to Government, and it shall be lawful for the Income-tax Officer, if for any special reasons to be recorded he so thinks fit, to have recourse to any such mode of recovery notwithstanding that the tax due is being recovered from an assessee by any other mode. (7A) For the purposes of this section, the expression "Collector" shall include (a) an additional collector or any other officer authorised to exercise the powers of a collector under any law for the time being in force in a State relating to land revenue ; and (b) a Collector in Pakisthan. (8) The Income-tax Officer may forward a certificate under sub-section (2) to a Collector in Pakistan through the Central Board of Revenue of Pakistan if the assessee has property in the district of that Collector. (9) Where a Collector in the taxable territories receives through the Central Board of Revenue of India a certificate under the signature of an Income-tax Officer in Pakistan, the Collector shall proceed to recover the amount specified therein in the manner in which he would proceed to recover the amount specified in a certificate received from an Income-tax Officer in the taxable territories, and shall remit any sum so recovered by him to the Income-tax Officer in Pakistan, after deducting his expenses in connection with the recovery proceedings.
