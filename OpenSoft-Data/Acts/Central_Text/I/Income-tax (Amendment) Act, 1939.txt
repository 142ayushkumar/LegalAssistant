[See section 10 (7).] Rules for the Computation of the Profits and Gains of Insurance Business. 1. In the case of any person who carries on, or at any time in the preceding year carried on, life insurance business, the profits and gains of such person from that business shall be computed separately from his income, profits or gains from any other business. 2. The profits and gains of life insurance business shall be taken to be either- (a) the gross external incomings of the preceding year from that business less the management expenses of that year, or (b) the annual average of the surplus disclosed by the actuarial valuation made for the last inter-valuation period ending before the year for which the assessment is to be made, after adjusting such surplus so as to exclude from it any surplus or deficit included therein which was made in any earlier inter-valuation period and any expenditure other than expenditure which may under the provisions of section 10 of this Act be allowed for in computing the profits and gains of a business, whichever is the greater : Provided that the amount to be allowed as management expenses shall not exceed- (?) 7 1/2 percent. of the premiums received during the preceding year in respect of single premium life insurance policies, plus (b) in respect of the first year’s premiums received in respect of other life insurance policies for which the number of annual premiums received is less than twelve, or for which the number of years during which premiums are payable is less than twelve, for each such premium or each such year 7 1/2 percent. of such first year’s premiums received during the preceding year, plus (c) 85 percent. of the first year’s premiums received during the preceding year in respect of other life insurance policies and 8 1/2 percent. of other premiums received during that year in respect of all life insurance policies other than single premium life insurance policies. 3. In computing the surplus for the purpose of rule 2,- (a) one-half of the amounts paid to or reserved for or expended on behalf of policyholders shall be allowed as a deduction : Provided that in the first such computation made under this rule of any such surplus no account shall be taken of any such amounts to the extent to which they are paid out of or in respect of any surplus brought forward from a previous intervaluation period : Provided further that if any amount so reserved for policyholders ceases to be so reserved, and is not paid to or expended on behalf of policyholders, one-half of such amount, if it has been previously allowed as a deduction, shall be treated as part of the surplus for the period in which the said amount ceased to be so reserved ; (b) any amount either written off or reserved in the accounts or through the actuarial valuation balance sheet to meet depreciation of or loss on the realisation of securities or other assets, shall be allowed as a deduction, and any sums taken credit for in the accounts or actuarial valuation balance sheet on account of appreciation, of or gains on the realisation of the securities or other assets shall be included in the surplus : Provided that if upon investigation it appears to the Income-tax Officer after consultation with the Superintendent of Insurance that having due regard to the necessity for making reasonable provision for bonuses to participating policyholders and for contingencies, the rate of interest or other factor employed in determining the liability in respect of outstanding policies is materially inconsistent with the valuation of the securities and other assets so as artificially to reduce the surplus, such adjustment shall be made to the allowance for depreciation of, or to the amount to be included in the surplus in respect of appreciation of, such securities and other assets, as shall increase the surplus for the purposes of these rules to a figure which is fair and just; (c) the whole amount of interest received in respect of any securities of the Central Government which have been issued or declared to be income-tax free shall be deducted. 4. Where for any year an assessment is made in accordance with the annual average of a surplus disclosed by a valuation for an inter-valuation period exceeding twelve months, then, in computing the tax payable for that year, credit shall not be given in accordance with sub-section (5) of section 18 for the tax paid in the preceding year, but credit shall be given for the annual average of the income-tax paid by deduction at source from interest on securities or otherwise during such period. 5. For the purposes of these rules- (i) ‘ preceding year ’ means that year for which annual accounts are required to be prepared under the Insurance Act, 1938, immediately preceding the year for which the assessment is to be made or until the commencement of the Insurance Act, 1938, the previous year as defined in section 2 of this Act; (ii) ' gross external incomings ' means the full amount of incomings from interest, dividends, lines and fees and all other incomings from whatever source derived (except premiums received from policyholders and interest and dividends on any annuity fund) and includes also profits from reversions and on the sale or the granting of annuities, but excludes profits on the realisation of securities : Provided that incomings, including the annual value of the property occupied by the assessee, which but for the provisions of sub-section (7) of section 10 would have been assessable under section 9 shall be computed upon the basis laid down in the last named section, and that there shall be allowed from such gross incomings such deductions as are permissible under that section ; (iii) ‘ management expenses ’ means the full amount of expenses (including commissions) incurred exclusively in the management of the business of life insurance, and in the case of a company carrying on other classes of business as well as the business of life insurance in addition thereto a fair proportion of the expenses incurred in the general management of the whole business. Bonuses or other sums paid to or reserved on behalf of policyholders, depreciation of, and Iosses on the realisation of, securities and any expenditure other than expenditure which may under the provisions of section 10 of this Act be allowed for in computing the profits and gains of a business are not management expenses for the purposes of these rules ; (iv) 'life insurance business ' means life insurance business as defined in clause (11) of section 2 of the Insurance Act, 1938 ; (v) 'securities’ includes stocks and shares. 6. The profits and gains of any business of insurance other than life insurance shall be taken to be the balance of the profits disclosed by the annual accounts, copies of which are required under the Insurance Act, 1938, to be furnished to the Superintendent of Insurance., after adjusting such balance so as to exclude from it any expenditure other than expenditure which may under the provisions of section 10 of this Act be allowed for in computing the profits and gains of a business. Profits and losses on the realisation of investments, and depreciation and appreciation of the value of investments shall be dealt with as provided in rule 3 for the business of life insurance. 7. The profits and gains of companies carrying on dividing society or assessment business shall be taken to be 15 percent. of the premium income of the previous year, or in the case of non-resident companies 15 percent. of the British Indian premium income of the previous year. 8. The profits and gains of the British Indian branches of an insurance company not resident in British India, in the absence of more reliable data, may be deemed to be the proportion of the total world income of the company corresponding to the proportion which its British Indian premium income bears to its total premium income. For the purpose of this rule, the total world income of life insurance companies not resident in British India whose profits are periodically ascertained by actuarial valuation shall be computed in the manner laid down in these rules for the computation of the profits and gains of life insurance business carried on in British India. 9. These rules apply to the assessment of the profits of any business of insurance carried on by a mutual insurance company."
