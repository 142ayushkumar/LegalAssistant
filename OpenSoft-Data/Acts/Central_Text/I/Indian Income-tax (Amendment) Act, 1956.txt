Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1956_Section Preamble--> An Act further to amend the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. BE it enacted by Parliament in the Seventh Year of the Republic of India as follows :-
Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1956_Section 1--> This Act may be called the Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1956. Notes :- Object-"The powers conferred by sub-section (7A) of section 5 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. have always been construed by the Income-tax authorities as enabling them to transfer the case of any person from one Income tax Officer to another, and once this is done, all assessments in relation to the person whose case is so transferred, irrespective of the years to which they relate are to be made by the Income-tax Officer who is in charge of assessing that person. The Supreme Court has, however, held in Messrs. Bidi Supply Co. vs. The Union of India (Petition No. 271 of 1955) that this sub-section only authorises the transfer of a pending proceeding for a particular assessment year. It has now become necessary to clarify the meaning of the word "case" as understood by the Income-tax authorities, and incidentally the amendment is given retrospective operation so as to regularise past actions " (Vide Statement of Objects and Reasons, printed in the Gazette of India, Extraordinary, Pt II-Sec. 2, No. 24, dated the 16th May, 1956)
Indian Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1956_Section 2--> In sub-section (7A) of section 5 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, the following Explanation shall be, and shall be deemed always to have been inserted at the end, namely : - "Explanation.-In this sub-section 'case' in relation to any person whose name is specified in the order of transfer means all proceedings under this Act in respect of any year which may be pending on the date of the transfer, and includes all proceedings under this Act which may be commenced after the date of the transfer in respect of any year.".
