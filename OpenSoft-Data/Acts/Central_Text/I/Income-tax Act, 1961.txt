Thus, the four-year blocks will be 1986-89, 1990-93, 1994-97, 1998- 2001, 2002-05, 2006-09, 2010-13, 2014-17 and so on. If an assessee has not availed travel concession or assistance during any of the specified four-year block periods on one of the two permitted occasions, or on both occasions, exemption can be claimed provided he avails the concession or assistance in the calendar year immediately following that block. This is popularly known as the 'carry-over' concession. In such cases, the exemption so availed will not be counted for purposes of regulating the future exemptions allowable for the succeeding block of four years. Quantum of exemption - The basic rule is that the quantum of exemption will be limited to the actual expenses incurred on the journey. This pre-supposes that, without performing any journey and incurring expenses thereon, no exemption can be claimed. In addition to the above general limitation, the quantum of exemption will also be subject to the following maximum limits, depending upon the mode of transport used or available: JOURNEYS PERFORMED ON OR AFTER 1-10-1997 For journeys performed by Air Air economy fare of the national carrier (Indian Airlines or Air India) by the shortest route to the place of destination. Where place of origin of journey and destination are connected by rail and the journey is performed by any mode of transport other than by Air-conditioned first class rail fare by the shortest route to the place of destination. Where place of origin of journey and destination or part thereof are not connected by rail (i) Where a recognised public transport system exists, the first class or deluxe class fare on such transport by the shortest route to the place of destination. (ii) Where no recognised public transport system exists, the air-conditioned first class rail fare, for the distance of the journey by the shortest route, as if the journey has been performed by rail. Restricted concession for children - Under sub-rule (4) of rule 2B, inserted with effect from 1-10-1997, exemption on travel concession will not be admissible to more than two surviving children of an individual born after 1-10-1998. This restriction will not however apply in respect of children born before 1-10-1998, and also in cases where an individual, after getting one child, begets multiple children (twins/triplets/quadruplets, etc.) on the second occasion. The implications of this restriction will be as follows : In respect of journeys performed on or before 1-10-1998 exemption will be admissible in respect of all the surviving children of the individual. In respect of journeys performed after 1-10-1998 the exemption will be admissible to all surviving children born before 1-10-1998; in addition, the exemption will be admissible to only two surviving children born on or after 1-10-1998. In reckoning this limit of two children, children born out of multiple birth after the first child will be treated as 'one child' only. It may be noted that section 2(15B) of the Act defines a 'child' as includes 'a step-child and an adopted child of the individual'. Hence the aforesaid restrictions will operate in respect of step-children and adopted children also provided they are born on or after 1-10-1998.

When certificate may be executed - No step in execution of a certificate shall be taken until the period of fifteen days has elapsed since the date of the service of the notice required by the preceding rule : Provided that, if the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that the defaulter is likely to conceal, remove or dispose of the whole or any part of such of his movable property as would be liable to attachment in execution of a decree of a civil court and that the realisation of the amount of the certificate would in consequence be delayed or obstructed, he may at any time direct, for reasons to be recorded in writing, an attachment of the whole or any part of such property: Provided further that if the defaulter whose property has been so attached furnishes security to the satisfaction of the Tax Recovery Officer, such attachment shall be cancelled from the date on which such security is accepted by the Tax Recovery Officer. 4. Mode of recovery - If the amount mentioned in the notice is not paid within the time specified therein or within such further time as the Tax Recovery Officer may grant in his discretion, the Tax Recovery Officer shall proceed to realise the amount by one or more of the following modes :- (a) by attachment and sale of the defaulter's movable property; (b) by attachment and sale of the defaulter's immovable property; (c) by arrest of the defaulter and his detention in prison; (d) by appointing a receiver for the management of the defaulter's movable and immovable properties. 5.

Purchaser's title - (1) Where property is sold in execution of a certificate, there shall vest in the purchaser merely the right, title and interest of the defaulter at the time of the sale, even though the property itself be specified. (2) Where immovable property is sold in execution of a certificate, and such sale has become absolute, the purchaser's right, title and interest shall be deemed to have vested in him from the time when the property is sold, and not from the time when the sale becomes absolute. 7. Suit against purchaser not maintainable on ground of purchase being made on behalf of plaintiff - (1) No suit shall be maintained against any person claiming title under a purchase certified by the Tax Recovery Officer in the manner laid down in this Schedule, on the ground that the purchase was made on behalf of the plaintiff or on behalf of some one through whom the plaintiff claims. (2) Nothing in this section shall bar a suit to obtain a declaration that the name of any purchaser certified as aforesaid was inserted in the certificate fraudulently or without the consent of the real purchaser, or interfere with the right of a third person to proceed against that property, though ostensibly sold to the certified purchaser, on the ground that it is liable to satisfy a claim of such third person against the real owner. 8. 4 [Disposal of proceeds of execution - (1) Whenever assets are realised by sale or otherwise in execution of a certificate, the proceeds shall be disposed of in the following manner, namely :- (a) they shall first be adjusted towards the amount due under the certificate in execution of which the assets were realised and the costs incurred in the course of such execution; (b) if there remains a balance after the adjustment referred to in clause (a), the same shall be utilised for satisfaction of any other amount recoverable from the assessee under this Act which may be due on the date on which the assets were realised; and (c) the balance, if any, remaining after the adjustments under clauses (a) and (b) shall be paid to the defaulter. (2) If the defaulter disputes any adjustment under clause (b) of sub-rule (1), the Tax Recovery Officer shall determine the dispute.] 9. General bar to jurisdiction of civil courts, save where fraud alleged - Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, every question arising between the 5 [Tax Recovery] Officer and the defaulter or their representatives, relating to the execution, discharge or satisfaction of a certificate 6 [...], or relating to the confirmation or setting aside by an order under this Act of a sale held in execution of such certificate, shall be determined, not by suit, but by order of the Tax Recovery Officer before whom such question arises : Provided that a suit may be brought in a civil court in respect of any such question upon the ground of fraud. 10. Property exempt from attachment - (1) All such property as is by the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), exempted from attachment and sale in execution of a decree of a civil court shall be exempt from attachment and sale under this Schedule. (2) The Tax Recovery Officer's decision as to what property is so entitled to exemption shall be conclusive. 11. Investigation by Tax Recovery Officer - (1) Where any claim is preferred to, or any objection is made to the attachment or sale of, any property in execution of a certificate, on the ground that such property is not liable to such attachment or sale, the Tax Recovery Officer shall proceed to investigate the claim or objection : Provided that no such investigation shall be made where the Tax Recovery Officer considers that the claim or objection was designedly or unnecessarily delayed. (2) Where the property to which the claim or objection applies has been advertised for sale, the Tax Recovery Officer ordering the sale may postpone it pending the investigation of the claim or objection, upon such terms as to security or otherwise as the Tax Recovery Officer shall deem fit. (3) The claimant or objector must adduce evidence to show that- (a) (in the case of immovable property) at the date of the service of the notice issued under this Schedule to pay the arrears, or (b) (in the case of movable property) at the date of the attachment, he had some interest in, or was possessed of, the property in question. (4) Where, upon the said investigation, the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that, for the reason stated in the claim or objection, such property was not, at the said date, in the possession of the defaulter or of some person in trust for him or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him, or that, being in the possession of the defaulter at the said date, it was so in his possession, not on his own account or as his own property, but on account of or in trust for some other person, or partly on his own account and partly on account of some other person, the Tax Recovery Officer shall make an order releasing the property, wholly or to such extent as he thinks fit, from attachment or sale. (5) Where the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that the property was, at the said date, in the possession of the defaulter as his own property and not on account of any other person, or was in the possession of some other person in trust for him, or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him, the Tax Recovery Officer shall disallow the claim. (6) Where a claim or an objection is preferred, the party against whom an order is made may institute a suit in a civil court to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute; but, subject to the result of such suit (if any), the order of the Tax Recovery Officer shall be conclusive. 12.
