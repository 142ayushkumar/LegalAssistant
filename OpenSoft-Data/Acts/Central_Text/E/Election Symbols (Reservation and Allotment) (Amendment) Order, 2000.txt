Classification of political parties (1) For the purposes of this Order and for such other purposes as the Commission may specify as and when necessity therefor arises, political parties are either recognised political parties or unrecognised political parties. (2) A recognised political party shall either be a National party or a State party. 6A. Conditions for recognition as a National party A political party shall be treated as a recognised National party, if, and only if, - either (A)(i) the candidates set up by it, in any four or more States, at the last general election to the House of the People, or to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned, have secured not less than six percent of the total valid votes polled in their respective States at that general election; and (ii) in addition, it has returned at least four members to the House of the People at the aforesaid last general election from any State or States; or (B)(i) its candidates have been elected to the House of the People, at the last general election to that House, from at least two percent of the total number of parliamentary constituencies in India, any fraction exceeding one-half being counted as one; and (ii) the said candidates have been elected to that House from not less than three States. 6B. Conditions for recognition as a State party A political party, other than a National party, shall be treated as a recognised State party in a State or States, if, and only if, - either (A)(i) the candidates set up by it, at the last general election to the House of the People, or to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned, have secured not less than six percent of the total valid votes polled in that State at that general election; and (ii) in addition, it has returned at least two members to the Legislative Assembly of the State at the last general election to that Assembly; or (B) it wins at least three percent of the total number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the State, (any fraction exceeding one-half being counted as one), or at least three seats in the Assembly, whichever is more, at the aforesaid general election. 6C. Conditions for continued recognition as a National or State party. If a political party is recognised as a National party under paragraph 6A, or as a State party under paragraph 6B, the question whether it shall continue to be so recognised after any subsequent general election to the House of the People or, as the case may be, to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned, shall be dependent upon the fulfilment by it of the conditions specified in the said paragraphs on the results of that general election. 7. Savings and Interpretation (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph 6A, 6B or 6C, if any political party stands recognised, immediately before the commencement of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) (Amendment) Order, 2000, either as a National party or as a State party in some State or States, the said party shall continue to have and enjoy the status of such National or State party for the purposes of the next general election, to be held after the commencement of the said Order, to the House of the People or, as the case may be, to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned, and its continued recognition as such National or State party shall thereafter be dependent upon the fulfilment by it of the conditions specified in paragraph 6A or, as the case may be, paragraph 6B. (2) For the removal of doubt, it is hereby clarified that the conditions in paragraph 6A or paragraph 6B shall not be deemed to have been satisfied by a political party, - (i) if it is newly formed, whether as a result of split in a recognised National or State party or otherwise, and registered with the Commission under section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 , after the last general election to the House of the People or, as the case may be, to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned; or (ii) on the joining or taking the membership of that party, by a member of the House of the People, or the Legislative Assembly of a State, after his election to that House or, as the case may be, that Assembly.
