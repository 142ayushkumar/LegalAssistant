Government of India Act, 1919_Section Preamble--> WHEREAS it is the declared policy of Parliament to provide for the increasing, association of Indians in every branch of Indian administration, and f or the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to the progressive realization of responsible government in British India as an integral part of the empire: And whereas progress in giving effect to this policy can only be achieved by successive stages, and It is expedient that substantial steps in this direction should now be taken: And whereas the time and manner of each advance can be determined only by Parliament, upon whom responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of the Indian peoples: And whereas the action of Parliament in such matters must be guided by the co-operation received from those on whom new opportunities of service will be conferred, and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can be reposed in their sense of responsibility: And whereas concurrently with the gradual development of self-governing institutions in the Provinces of India it is expedient to give to those Provinces in provincial matters the largest measure of independence of the Government of India which is compatible with the due discharge by the latter of its own responsibilities: Be it therefore enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:
