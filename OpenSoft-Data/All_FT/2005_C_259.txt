1.  While considering Application No. C/S/402 of 2005 in Appeal No. C/164 of 2005 the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai has not only disposed of the stay application but has also disposed of the main appeal.
2. While disposing of the main appeal liberty has been given to the parties to seek clarification from this Court with regard to liability under the judgment of this Court in the case of Commr. of Customs v.
