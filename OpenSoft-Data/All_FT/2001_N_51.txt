Shankar Lal Agrawal v Nand Kishore Rateria and Anr
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 407/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Upon hearing the submissions made on behalf of the parties, in our view, the High Court has approached the matter from a totally erroneous point of view.
2.  Section 145(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not authorise the High Court to direct the Magistrate to add any party and record a fresh finding as to who is in actual possession.
3. The order is ex-facie bad and as such cannot be sustained.
The appeal, therefore, succeeds and the order of the High Court is set aside.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
