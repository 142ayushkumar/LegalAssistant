R. Subramania Iyer v Deivanai Achi
Supreme Court of India

10 December 1986
C.A. No. 5 of 1974.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal arises out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 3175 of 1973 granted by this Court. The only question is as to whether the advantage of Section 15 of the Tamil Nadu Debt Relief Act, 1972 was available the appellant/judgment-debtor.
2.  Admittedly the judgment-debtor was entitled to file an application under Section 15 of the Tamil Nadu Debt Relief Act for scaling down of the decretal amount but this application had to be filed within six months after the publication of the notification of the Act. It is not disputed that the application under Section 15 of the Tamil Nadu Debt Relief Act was not filed within the specified time but the point of dispute is that the application under Section 16 of the Tamil Nadu Debt Relief Act was filed for stay of the execution.
3.   The Executing Court as well as the High Court took the view that no benefit would be given to the judgment-debtor as the application under Section 15 has not been filed within the time prescribed. The view taken by the courts below is correct. We see no reason to interfere in this appeal.
4.  The appeal, is, therefore, dismissed. Interim stay vacated. Parties are directed to bear their own costs.
Appeal dismissed.
