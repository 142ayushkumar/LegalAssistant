Union of India v A. K. Chakraborty
Supreme Court of India

27 September 1994
C.A. No. 1818 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard Shri Altaf Ahmed, learned Additional Solicitor General for the appellant Union of India and Shri Avijit Bhattacharjee, learned counsel for the respondent.
2.  While the Tribunal, in our opinion rightly, recognised the position that the appointing authority could, for sufficient reasons to be placed or record, differ from the recommendations of the Departmental Promotion Committee, it however, found that such reasons were shown to be obtaining. According to the Tribunal, the matter, therefore, required a fresh consideration. The operative part of the Tribunal's order reads:
"The Appointment Committee is at liberty to consider the recommendation of the DPC again, but in the meantime the applicant should not be placed in any post under any of his juniors."
3.  The appointing authority has, thus, the liberty to consider whether the reasons justifying and departure from the recommendations of the DPC exist. The reconsideration shall be done as expeditiously as possible; but in any event not later then four months from today.
4.  We find no infirmity either of reasoning or conclusion reached by the Tribunal. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
