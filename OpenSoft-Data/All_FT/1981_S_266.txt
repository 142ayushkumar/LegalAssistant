1.  By this petition, the petitioner only wanted a similar stay order as was passed in the case of Ram Gopal Shukla (Civil appeal No. 282 of 1980) on April 23, 1980, in C. M. P. No. 1634 of 1980. That relief has already been granted to the petitioner, as the counsel for the petitioner states.
2. In the circumstances, this writ petition has become infructuous and is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
