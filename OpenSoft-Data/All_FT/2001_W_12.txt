Tayabbhai M. Bagsarwalla and Anr v West Coast Adhesives and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9130-9131/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  It is not disputed that the Receiver had taken possession of the property in pursuance to the order passed by the High Court. Now the Court has directed the Receiver to give back the possession to the respondent-applicants. We do not find any illegality in the said order.
2. Shri Gopal Subramaniam, learned senior counsel for the petitioner, urged that in fact the property includes the unauthorised construction made by the respondent-applicants and, therefore, the Receiver may be directed to remove such construction before handing over the property.
3.  We do not think that it would be appropriate for us to pass any such order, since it is open to the petitioner to take proceeding for removal of such construction before the appropriate authority or forum.
4. We may also make it clear that any finding recorded by the High Court shall not come in the way of the Court deciding the petitioners application or petition.With these observations, we dispose of this special leave petition.
Petition disposed of.
