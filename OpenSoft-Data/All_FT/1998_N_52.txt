New India Assurance Company v C. M. Jaya and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 July 1998
C.As. Nos. 4566-4567 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question involved in these appeals is whether in a case of insurance policy not taking any higher liability by accepting a higher premium, in case of payment of compensation to a third party, the insurer would be liable to the extent limited u/s. 95(2) or the insurer would be liable to pay the entire amount and he may ultimately recover from the insured. On this question, there appears to be some apparent conflict in the two three-Judge Bench decisions of this Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Shanti Bai, 1995 Indlaw SC 618 and Amrit Lal Sood v. Kaushalya Devi Thapar, 1998 Indlaw SC 643.
2.  In the latter decision, unfortunately the decision in New India Assurance case, 1995 Indlaw SC 618, has not been noticed though reference has been made to the decision of this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Jugal Kishore,  1988 Indlaw SC 8451988 Indlaw SC 845, which was relied upon in the earlier three-Judge Bench judgment.
3. In view of the apparent conflict in these two three-Judge Bench decisions, we think it appropriate that the records of this case may be placed before my Lord, the Chief Justice of India to constitute a larger Bench for resolving the conflict. We accordingly so direct. The record may now be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India.
Order accordingly.
