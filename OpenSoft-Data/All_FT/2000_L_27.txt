State of Andhra Pradesh v Lankapalli Venkateswarlu
Supreme Court of India

14 March 2000
Cr.A. No. 581 of 1996, Dt. 14 March 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The State is in appeal against an order of acquittal recorded by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh.
2.  We have perused the evidence recorded by the Trial Court with the assistance of learned counsel for the parties. Not only has the prosecutrix given a go-bye to the version, in material particulars, as recorded in the FIR in her evidence recorded in Court, but, even the medical evidence recorded by the Doctor - P.W. 12 does not at all support the allegations made by the prosecutrix.
3.  In the face of the evidence on the record, the view expressed by the High Court cannot be said to be unreasonable, let alone perverse. The order of acquittal does not merit any interference. The appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed. The respondent is on bail. His bail bonds shall stand discharged.
Appeal dismissed.
