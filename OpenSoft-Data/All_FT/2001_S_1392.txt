C.A..No.4953/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the High Court was in error in entertaining the Regular Second Appeal.
2.  Important questions of law especially relating to limitation clearly arose in the instant case and the High Court ought to have decided the case after framing questions of law and taking into consideration the evidence on the record.
3. We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the order dated 16.5.2000 of the High Court and restore R.S.A. No.11859/2000 on the board of the High Court which will decide the case on merits.
