Kavita Ojha v Ashwani Kumar Sharma
Supreme Court of India

17 December 2008
TRANSFER PETITION(CIVIL)NO. 67 OF 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties, we are of the view that sufficient grounds have been made out for allowing the petition for transfer, having particular regard to ground No.(i) which indicates that the petitioner has a minor female child of two years and it is, therefore, difficult for her to travel from Chennai to Churu, Rajasthan, to conduct the matrimonial case filed by the respondent-husband.
Accordingly, the transfer petition is allowed.
2.  Let the Civil Case No.68 of 2007, pending in the court of District & Sessions Judge, Churu (Rajasthan), be transferred to the Family Court at Chennai (Tamil Nadu).
3.  It will be upto the parties to approach the Mediation Cell in Madras High Court, if so advised.
