The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is a reported judgment of this Court that the Chamber Judge is entitled to deal with and finally dispose of the application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
2. In that view of the matter the note circulated has no basis. Since the application for condonation of delay has already been dismissed about a year back, the civil appeal is dismissed as barred by limitation.
Appeal dismissed.
