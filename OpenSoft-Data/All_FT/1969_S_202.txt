1. This appeal is brought by certificate from the judgment of the Punjab High Court dated May 8, 1964 in L.P.A. Nos. 230/304 of 1962.
2. Sardar Sewa Singh Gill (respondent no. 1) wanted to promote a company for the manufacture of Banaspati and for that purpose he -approached the Maharaja of Patiala for, certain concessions and grant of land at Doraha. Subsequently by an order of the ijlis-i-khas dated October 29, 1946 it was decided to give to Sardar Sewa Singh Gill a plot of land measuring about 96,700 sq. yds. at Doraha.
3. This plot of land wag to be made over to him on payment of the costs of the land. Certain undertakings were given by the respondent no. 1. Possession of the land was handed over to respondent no. 1 on November 17, 1946 vide Ex. P.W. 1/1, report no. 96. On February 4, 1947 an agreement Ex. C.W. 13 was entered into between Sewa Santokh Brothers (P) Ltd., arid the Patiala State for grant of certain concessions for the establishment of the ghee factory. The ghee factory that was to be established was styled as the Patiala Banaspati and Allied Products Co. Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as the Company). Cl. 6 of the agreement states :

In respect of such portion of the land as the Government property it shall be made available at such concessional rates as may be fixed by the Minister in charge of Development and in regard to such portion as may have to be acquired for the Company from private owners, such cost shall be paid to the State as may be assessed under the. provisions of the Patiala Land Acquisition Act, 1995 Bk.

4. On February 12, 1947 Messrs Sewa Santokh Brothers was incorporated and on May 27, 1948 the Company was incorpo- rated. On April 20, 1948 prospectus of the Company as filed with the Registrar of Joint Stock Company, Patiala and on July 21, 1948 certificate for the commencement of business was granted to the Company. Admittedly the Company never went into production or ever erected the factory. On December 24, 1951 a petition for the winding up of the Company was filed by S. Sewa Singh Gill in the name of the Company. On February 26, 1952 two provisional liquidators of the Company were appointed namely S. Kartar Singh Kawatra and R. N. Sanghi. This petition was, however, dismissed on October 13, 1952 on the ground that it was not competent.
5. On October 28, 1954 13 shareholders filed a petition for compulsory winding up of the Company and on 21st October 1955 an order for the compulsory winding up of the Company was passed by the PEPSU High Court. On the passing of this order the voluntary liquidators resigned and the Bank of Patiala was appointed as the Official Liquidator. The Bank of Patiala took over possession of the property of the Company and on August 13, 1959 auctioned its machinery. Various claim petitions were filed including L.M. 106 of 1957 and L.M. 32 of 1952 wherein, respondent no. 1 claimed various sums on account of expenses incurred including the land at Doraha. The petitions were heard by Mahajan, J. who by his order dated May 26, 1962 disallowed the claim of res- pondent no. 1 to the land but held that the land remained vested in the respondent Company till such time as State exercised its rights under the agreement of February 4, 1947. Against the judgment of the learned Single Judge the State of Punjab filed L.P.A. 304 of 1962 and respondent no. 1 filed L.P.A. 230 of 1962. The appeals were heard by Dulat and Pandit, JJ. who on May 8, 1964 allowed the appeal of the State to the extent that the land in dispute belonged to the State but its possession would remain with the Company till a valid notice was given by the State. In support of this appeal it was contended on behalf of the State of Punjab that the High Court was in error in holding that the first notice given by the Director of Industries to the provisional liquidators was not legally sufficient and the respondent no. 2 was not bound to give possession to the State unless a fresh notice was given. In our opinion the argument put forward on behalf of the appellant is well- founded and 'must be accepted as correct.
6. In the first place it is obvious that the title to the land has already vested in the State Government under the third proviso to cl. 6(a) of the Agreement because of the order of winding up of the Company made by the High Court. There is nothing in the agreement to suggest that the Company was entitled to be in possession of the property even after its title had vested in the State Government. The 4th proviso only states that if the Company does not deliver possession within reasonable time and if any machinery, plant, buildings or structures remain on the land the title to these also will vest in the State Government if the Company does not remove the structures or the machinery within 24 months from date of the notice. In the circumstances of the case we are of opinion that the respondents were given sufficient notice by the letter of the Director of Industries dated August 14, 1952. That notice satisfies the requirements of the fourth proviso of cl. 6(a) of the Agreement and the State is entitled to take possession of the land and other properties located therein within two years from date of that notice.
7. It is necessary to state that according to P.W. 4 Jaswant Singh the buildings on the site are in an area of one bigha, the structure was pucca but temporary. It is the admitted case that the machinery has been sold by auction more than seven years back and only grass grows on the land. The evidence of Tarachand R. W. 1 also shows that a greater part of the land is barren and the machinery and other valuable properties had already been removed. Counsel on behalf of respondent no. 2 prayed that some further time may be given before the State takes possession of the properties. We consider that a further period of six months' time will be sufficient.
8. For these reasons' we hold that the order of the Division Bench May 8, 1964 should be modified and the respondents should be directed to hand over possession of the land in dispute to the State of Punjab within six months from this date. We accordingly allow this appeal. But there will be no order as to costs.
