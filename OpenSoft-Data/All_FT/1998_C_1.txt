Controller of Estate Duty v C. B. Prasad
Supreme Court of India

12 February 1998
C.A. No. 1533 of 1982
The Judgment was delivered by: KIRPAL, J.
1.  In the instant case the High Court followed its earlier decision in the case of V. Devaki Ammal v. ASST. CED, 1972 Indlaw MAD 126, in which it had been held that section 34(1)(c) of the Estate Duty Act, 1953, was ultra vires.
2. Following the said decision, the question of law referred by the Tribunal in the instant case was answered in favour of the assessee. The decision of the High Court in V Devaki Ammal v. Asst. CED, 1972 Indlaw MAD 126, came up in appeal and in the judgment reported as Asst. CED v. V. Devaki Ammal 1994 Indlaw SC 1980, the view of the High Court was reversed and it was held that section 34(1)(c) of the Act was valid.
3.  This being so, the decision of the High Court in the present case has to be set aside and as the High Court did not go into the merits of the question, we remand the case to the High Court for deciding the case afresh in accordance with law.
There will be no order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
