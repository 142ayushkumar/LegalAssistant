M.V. Ganesh and Another v Kaloor Joseph and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6977/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
SLP(C) No.7642/2001:
1. Delinked. Service is not complete. The petitioner may take steps for serving unserved respondents.
2.  In rest of the SLPs. On a public interest litigation being filed, the High Court passed an interim order relying upon Rule 13(3) of the Foreign Liquor Rules and directed not to renew any application for licence. This Court entertained the application and stayed the interim order.
3.  Having heard the counsel for the State as well as Mr. Iyer for the Writ Petitioner before the Kerala High Court, and Mr. Vaidyanathan appearing for the petitioner in the SLP, we dispose of these petitions by setting aside the interim order of the High Court and by requesting the Division Bench of Kerala High Court to dispose of the pending Writ Application early preferably within 3 months from today.
4. We make it clear that we are not expressing any opinion on the merits of the pending Writ Application. The Special Leave Petitions are disposed of accordingly.
Petitions disposed of.
