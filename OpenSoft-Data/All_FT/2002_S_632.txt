Lata Bansal v State of Tamil Nadu and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 December 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.
1.  In our view, this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution is not required to be entertained as the matter is pending before the trial court. In any case it would beopen to the petitioner to approach the High Court for appropriate relief.
2. It has been pointed out that one miscellaneous application in Guardian Case No.208/99 is pending before the Tis Hazari Court and after hearing the said application judgment is not pronounced since August 2001. Not pronouncing judgment for such a long period is disturbing.
3.  Tis Hazari Court is directed to pronounce the order at the earliest. Registrar General of the Delhi High Court is directed to verify the reasons of not rendering judgment within reasonable time by calling the explanation from the concerned Judge. With this observation, the writ petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
