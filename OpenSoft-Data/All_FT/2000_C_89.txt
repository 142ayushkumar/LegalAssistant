Since the aforesaid undertaking has already been furnished in the High Court, without examining the question of law raised we dispose of this SLP with the direction that the appeal of the State may be disposed of by the High Court within 4 months from today and this undertaking will remain binding till the disposal of the appeal. The SLP is disposed of accordingly.
