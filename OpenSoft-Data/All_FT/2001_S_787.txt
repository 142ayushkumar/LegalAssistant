Gangadhar Mandal v State of Jharkhand
Supreme Court of India

26 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 970/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel submits that petitioner would be advised to approach the trial court and surrender and also to move the application for bail as the High Court had directed the trial court to dispose of the bail application on the same day itself. Learned counsel submits that there is no reason for him to apprehend that the trial court would not release him on bail.
2.  Hence, petitioner would be advised to approach the trial court with that application. Since he proposes to adopt the said course of action learned counsel requests for permission to withdraw this SLP. Special Leave Petition is dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
