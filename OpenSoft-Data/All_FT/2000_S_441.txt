State of Haryana and Others v Ram Kumar Etc
Supreme Court of India

22 August 2000
Review Petition (Civil) No. 776-85 of 2000 in S.L.P. (Civil) Nos. 16235-44 of 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The order of the High Court allowing the writ petition and directing reinstatement with full consequential benefits is dated 20.5.1999.
The SLP has been dismissed on 10.4.2000.
2.  The order of the Government dated 13.1.2000 states that the respondent has been reinstated. It does not, of course, deal with consequential benefits.
3.  In the review petitions, a latter order of the Government dated 8.3.2000 which states that no back wages will be granted, is relied upon.
4.  This order dated 8.3.2000 was not brought to the notice of this Court on 10.4.2000 and apart from that, it is not known under what authority the Government can refuse to pay back wages etc. by way of an administrative order when the High Court order dated 20.5.99 was in full force. By an administrative order, the Government cannot overrule a judgment. Such an administrative order is no ground for review.
5. There is no merit in the review petitions and they are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
