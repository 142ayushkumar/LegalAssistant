Special leave granted.
1.  In these appeals arising from the decision rendered by the High Court of Bombay in Writ Petition Nos. 2830 of 1989, 4967 of 1988, 5445 of 1987, 3876 of 1988, 2915 of 1988, 2678 of 1988, 3709 of 1988 and 2776 of 1989 with CA No. 4339 of 1989, the question at issue was the same as one arising in Writ Petition No. 898 of 1990 disposed of today. By the judgment delivered in the said writ petition this Court has affirmed the earlier view taken by the Constitution Bench in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao v. Dean, Seth G. S. Medical College.
2.   In view of the same the very premise on which the judgment of the High Court rests is knocked out. The appeals must, therefore, be allowed.
3.  In the result we allow the appeals, set aside the impugned order of the High Court and direct that the writ petitions must stand dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
