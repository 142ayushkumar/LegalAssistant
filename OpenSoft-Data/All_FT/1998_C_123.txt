Supreme Court of India

15 January 1998
C.A. Nos. 256 to 261 of 1984 (From the judgment and order Dt. 17 November 1980 of the Madras High Court in T.C.P. Nos. 404 to 411 of 1980, reported as CIT vs. Vijaya Productions (P) Ltd. 1985 152 ITR 613 (Mad) : TC 54R.1130) & 3464 to 3467 of 1984
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  In view of the decision of this Court in the case of Sunil Siddharthbhai vs. CIT 1985 Indlaw SC 3351985 Indlaw SC 335, the development rebate was correctly withdrawn under s. 155(5) of the IT Act, 1961
2.  The appeals are, therefore, allowed. The High Court was not right in not directing a case to be stated before it under s. 256(2) of the IT Act, in respect of the following question:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in cancelling the order of the ITO withdrawing the development rebate already allowed for the asst. yrs. 1965-66 to 1972-73 consequent to the conversion of the assessee's proprietary business into a partnership firm ?"
3.  Since the point at issue is covered by the decision of this Court referred to above, we treat this question as a reference and answer it in the affirmative and in favour of the Revenue. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
