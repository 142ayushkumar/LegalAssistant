Umrao Singh v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

10 April 1981
Cr.A. No. 404 of 1981, (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 965 of 1981)
The Judgment was delivered by: TULZAPURKAR, J.
After hearing counsel for the parties, we are satisfied that this is a case falling under the proviso of S. 16(1)(a)(i) and therefore for adequate and special reasons, the sentence lower than the minimum prescribed could be awarded. The High Court itself felt bound to award the minimum sentence but on merits was satisfied that if the legal position warranted the appellant could be given lesser sentence.
1. We are in agreement with the view of the High Court. The appellant/petitioner is aged about 70 and suffering from Asthama illness and has a clean past record. Besides, the percentage of deficiency that was noticed in the milk sold by him was 0.4% in the fat contents.
Having regard to these facts, the expression of and the view of the High Court was justified. We accordingly reduce the sentence of the appellant to the period already undergone. The sentence of fine is maintained and we are informed that he has already paid the fine. Since he is already on bail, he should be released forthwith.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
