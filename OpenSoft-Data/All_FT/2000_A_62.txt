Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3319/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
I.A. NO.4 OF 2000: Learned counsel seeks to withdraw this application.
The application is, accordingly, dismissed as withrawn.
1.  S.L.P.(C) 3319 OF 2000: Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that with the death of the sole petitioner, this petition has been rendered infructuous. It is dismissed as such.
I.A. No.5 is also disposed of.
2.  S.L.P.(C) NO.... OF 2000 (CC:5021): Respondent No.4 had filed Writ Petition (C) No.26027/1999 which arose out of an interim order in arbitration proceedings. High Court made an order in the said Writ Petition on 14.2.2000. Against that order of the High Court, the present special leave petition has been filed by the petitioner. Learned counsel for respondent No.4 submits that since arbitration proceedings now stand withdrawn, Writ Petition (C) No.26027/1999 pending in the High Court does not survive further consideration as the same has been rendered infructuous.
3. We record the statement of the learned counsel for the writ petitioner. The High Court shall act on that statement and pass appropriate orders in the writ petition.
4.  Since Writ Petition(C) No.26027/1999, as noticed above, has been rendered infructuous, this special leave petition does not survive. It is dismissed accordingly. I.A. No.3 is also disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
