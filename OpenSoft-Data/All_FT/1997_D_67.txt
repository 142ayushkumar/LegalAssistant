Collector of Central Excise v Dies and Tools Limited, Calcutta
Supreme Court of India

19 February 1997
C.A. No. 3819 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The dispute is about classification of "T. C. tipped and H. S. S. Serrated type blades for milling cutters". The Assistant Collector, Customs, classified these goods under Entry 51-A (iii) of the First Schedule of the Central Excises Act. The decision of the Assistant Collector was reversed by the Collector in revision who was of the view that the goods were classifiable under Entry 51-A (iv). On further appeal, the Tribunal, after examining the goods, held that:
"It is clear, nor is it in dispute, that the subject goods are rotating tools and they are designed to be fitted into machine tools. And, such tools designed to be fitted into machine tools clearly fall under Item 51-A (iii), CET."
2.  We do not see any infirmity in the order of the Tribunal. The appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
