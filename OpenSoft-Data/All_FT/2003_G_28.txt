Supreme Court of India

1 September 2003
C.A. Nos. 7188-7190 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for both the parties.
1.  The complaint of the appellant in this case is that the appellant did not receive the notice of hearing hence could not appear before the Tribunal.
2.  In the facts and circumstances of this case and having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we think it appropriate that an opportunity should be given to the appellant to put forward its case, therefore, we set aside the order of the Tribunal and remand the matter back to the Tribunal for hearing the matter afresh after giving a fresh opportunity to both the parties of being heard.
Order accordingly.
