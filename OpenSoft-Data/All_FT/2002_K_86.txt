Asst. Collector Of Central Excise v Kashyap Engg. & Metallurgicals Pvt. Ltd
Supreme Court of India

18 April 2002
C.A. Nos. 6577-6578 of 1995, Dt. 18 April 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The respondent has been served but has not chosen to put in an appearance.
2.  The assessee-respondent made a claim for refund of excise duty under the provisions of the Excise Act which was beyond the permissible period thereunder. The refund claim having been rejected by the authorities, a writ petition was moved and allowed. The Revenue preferred a writ appeal, which was dismissed. The point now is covered by the decision of this Court in Mafatlal Industries Limited and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. 1996 Indlaw SC 1515 , where it has been held that the Court, in a writ petition, has to take note of the provisions of the Act and must exercise its discretion consistent with those provisions.
3. Much the same view was earlier taken in the judgment of this Court inCollector of Central Excise, Chandigarh v.Doaba Cooperative Sugar Mills 1988 Indlaw SC 554. The civil appeals are, therefore, allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
