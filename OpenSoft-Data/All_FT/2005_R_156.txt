Ranvir Singh and another v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

20 July 2005
C.As. No. 1428 of 2004 with Nos. 1429 of 2004 etc.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is the third case in a row which we are adjourning only because the counsel appearing for the Union of India are not prepared with the case. In a batch of cases (more than 200) on the same point, briefs have been allocated to different counsel with the result that neither of them is ready with the case. He/she is not possessed of oral/documentary evidence.
2. It is unfortunate that cases in which hundreds of crores of rupees are involved are being dealt and handled in such a casual manner.
Adjourned by two weeks.
3.  Copy of this order be placed before the learned Attorney General for India to take remedial steps so that in future unnecessary adjournments are not occasioned because of the lack of preparation on the part of the counsel.
4.  Counsel for DDA is directed to file a composite paper-book with short synopsis within 10 days from today with an advance copy to one of the counsel opposite.
Order accordingly.
