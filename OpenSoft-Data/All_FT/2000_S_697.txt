Santosh Maize and Ind. Limited v State of Tamil Nadu and Anr
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13832/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that inasmuch as the validity of the circular issued under Section 28A has been challenged it would be appropriate that this point of law is decided by the High Court rather than that the case is remanded to the authorities below.
2.  We, therefore, allow these appeals, set aside the judgments of the High Court and restore the writ petitions for being decided by the Madras High Court.
Appeals allowed.
