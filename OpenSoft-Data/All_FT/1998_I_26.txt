Commissioner of Sales Tax v Indian Express Newspapers Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

21 April 1998
C.A. No. 3812 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and perused the judgment and order under challenge. The appeal is pressed only in regard to waste newsprint obtained due to damage caused in transit or due to newsprint getting torn or spoilt in the process of printing. The High Court, relying upon the judgment of this Court in State of Gujarat v. Raipur Manufacturing Co. Ltd. 1966 Indlaw SC 2971966 Indlaw SC 297 found that there was no intention to carry on business in the discarded newsprint when the newsprint was acquired nor was such newsprint a by-product or a subsidiary product that arose in the course of the process of printing and publishing newspapers, which was the principal activity of the respondent.
2. We are in agreement with the view taken by the High Court and dismiss the appeal. No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
