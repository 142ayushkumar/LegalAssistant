Corporation of The City of Bangalore v Bangalore Stock Exchange
Supreme Court of India

8 November 2000
C.A. No. 13095 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having been unsuccessful before both the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench, the Corporation of the City of Bangalore is in appeal challenging the order of the Division Bench of the High Court in Writ Appeal No. 1746 of 1991 dated 2-8-1991.
2.  The appellant granted lease of a site measuring 80' x 92' in Banappa Park, District Office Road, Bangalore to the respondent for 50 years by a lease deed dated 3-12-1981. In 1985, the Karnataka Parks, Play-fields and Open Spaces (Preservation and Regulation) Act, 1985 came to be passed*. On 11-10-1986 the appellant issued notification including the said land in the list of open spaces.
3. It is on 30-10-1986 that the appellant passed a resolution declaring the site in question as civic amenities reserved for park and playground and then by resolution dated 15-1-1988 cancelled the lease granted in favour of the respondent. And by notice of 27-10-1988 the appellant demanded possession of the said site pursuant to the aforementioned cancellation of the lease. The respondent challenged the validity of the said notice in Writ Petition No. 17757 of 1988 in the High Court.
4.  A learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition and quashed the impugned notice. On appeal by the appellant a Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the writ appeal on 2-8-1991. It is that order which is under challenge before us.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
5.  A perusal of the lease deed executed by the appellant in favour of the respondent discloses that no right was reserved by the appellant to cancel the lease. No provision of law is brought to our notice, which enabled the appellant to cancel the lease which was binding upon them for the period of 50 years.
6.  Having gone through the judgment under challenge, we are of the view that no interference is called for by this Court. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
