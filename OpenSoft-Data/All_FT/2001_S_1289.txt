Mam Chand v State of Uttaranchal
Supreme Court of India

3 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2468/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The order appealed against arose from an action by which one appellate court declined to condone the delay in filing the appeal against the conviction and sentence passed on this appellant.
2. Against the order of the appellate court this appellant went to the High Court in revision, but the revision was dismissed by the impugned order. We also depricate the delay of 225 days in filing the appeal with the Sessions Court.
3.  Nonetheless this is the first appeal against the conviction and sentence of imprisonment. We are told that other connected appeals against the same trial court judgment are also to be heard by the same Sessions Court. Hence, we, take a lenient view in the matter.We, therefore, condone the delay in filing the appel before the appellate court. The said appeal has now become regularised. We direct the sessions court concerned to dispose of that appeal filed by the appellant along with the connected appeals. We make it clear that if the connected appeals have already been disposed of the appeal filed by the appellant can be disposed of independently. With these observations this appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
