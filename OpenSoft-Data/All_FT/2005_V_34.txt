Commissioner of Central Excise, Aurangabad v Videocon International Limited
Supreme Court of India

12 January 2005
C.A. No. 3665 of 1999 With C.A. Nos. 2343-2345 of 2002, 5661 of 2000, 148 of 2002 and 8408-8412 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In all these matters the concerned Assessee was only selling its products through their Depots. In some States where the Assessee had to pay sales tax they deducted the sales tax paid from the price of the goods. In States where the Assessee had benefit of exemption from sales tax, they paid sales tax on price without deducing the sales tax element. The Department contended that as the price was higher in that State, that price should be applicable for sales throughout India. Such a stand is clearly untenable.
2.  The Assessees, in all these cases have succeeded, and rightly so, before the Collector (Appeals) and the Tribunal. The position being so clear it is surprising that a decision to file Civil Appeals was taken. We see no substance in these Appeals. They all stand rejected.
However, there will be no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
