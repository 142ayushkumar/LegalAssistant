Commissioner of Income Tax v Indian Leaf Spring Manufacturing Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

18 March 1999
C.As. Nos. 6241 & 6242 of 1995 (From the judgment and order Dt. 18 September 1989 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in ITC Nos. 155 & 160 of 1989).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are concerned with the asst. yrs. 1979-80 to 1981-82. The question itself indicates the relevant facts. It reads thus :
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is correct in law in holding that the premia paid by the assessee on behalf of the employee-director formed part of 'salary' and allowable as deduction from computing the assessable income of the company and not 'perquisite', disallowable under s. 40A(5) or 40C(c) of the IT Act, 1961, for the asst. yrs. 1979-80, 1980-81 and 1981-82 ?"
2.  The High Court declined to call for a reference of this question, having regard to its earlier judgments.
3.  Our attention is drawn to the provisions of s. 40A(5) and Expln. 2(b) thereto where it is stated that the payment by an assessee of any sum, whether directly or through a fund, other than a recognised provident fund or an approved superannuation fund, to effect an assurance on the life of an employee or to effect a contract for an annuity is a perquisite.
4.  We think, in the circumstances, that a question of law does arise which should be considered by the High Court.
5.  Accordingly, the appeals are allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The question quoted above shall be referred by the Tribunal to the High Court for consideration, after drawing up a statement of case.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
