Additional Special Land Acquisition Officer v Yamanappa Basalingappa Chalwadi
Supreme Court of India

22 February 1994
Appeal (Civil) 3193-3215 of 1982
The Order of the Court was as follows :
These appeals by Special leave arise from the Judgment of the High Court of Karnataka dated August 10, 1981 in Misc. Appeal Nos. 1406-1428/1981. The High Court following its earlier Judgment in Special Land Acquisition Officer, Hassan v. Mallesha M.S.(1975) 2 Mysore Law Journal p.74, applying a multiplier of 15 years for the average annual income for Rs. 720 per acre upheld the fixation of the market value at Rs.800 per acre. Thus these appeals by Special Leave. Notification under Sec.4(l) dated March 13, 1980 was published in the State Gazette on July 24, 1980 acquiring 10 acres of land for Upper Krishana Project. The District Judge found from the evidence that the lands are madikattu lands and two dry crops of groundnuts in the first season, Jowar of cotton in the second rabi season were being raised in those lands. He determined the market value of the crop at Rs.720 after deducting the expenses incurred thereof. Though it is doubtful whether two crops could be raised in dry lands, under appeal we proceed on the footing that the evidence adduced would show that in the lands under acquisition two crops were raised and that annual yield was at Rs.720 per acre. But the crucial question is what is the suitable multiplier which would be applicable to the agricultural crops.
1. This question is squarely covered by a Judgment of this Court in Special land Acquisition Officer, Davangere v. P. Veerabharappa and Others 1984 (2) SCC 120 1984 Indlaw SC 263. While disposing of batch of the appeals this Court held those ten years multiplier would be the proper method in determining the total market value by following the method of capitalization as just and reasonable principle. We find that this principle is quite consistent with the valuation of the land allowed by multiplying the value of the annual yield, in the absence of any other acceptable evidence. Following the ratio we hold that ten years multiplier is the proper method of valuing the lands by capitalization method. The appeals are accordingly allowed in part and the respondents are entitled to the solarium at 15% and interest @ 5% from the date of taking possession till date of deposit.
2. The appellant is entitled to recover the balance amount from the respondents. No cost.
