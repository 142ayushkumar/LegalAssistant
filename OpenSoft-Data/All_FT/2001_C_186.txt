24 July 2001
C.A. No. 5833 of 1999 with C.As. Nos. 5829, 5834, 5835, 6709, 6588 and 7188 of 1999 and 76, 658, 659 and 892 of 2000 (C.A. No. 5833 of 1999 is from the judgment and order Dt. 23 April 1999 of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi, in Appeal No. E/5254/91-C).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
C.A. No. 5833/99 :
1.  The short question that arises for consideration in the present case relates to the products of the respondents which they represent as being animal feed supplements. It is not in dispute that the products of the respondents consist of one or more vitamins mixed together with dilutants and these products are used in a small quantity for improving animals' performance. The two competing entries are 2302 and 2936.
2.
"'For preparation of a kind used in animals feeding, including dogs and cats food' the rate of duty for this is nil."
"The rate of duty prescribed is 15 per cent for the vitamins."
3.  The Collector of Central Excise had come to the conclusion that the product did not fall under entry 2302 because the product had to be added in a small quantity to the main feed to get desired performance of the livestocks or to enhance the performance of the livestocks beyond the normal levels.
4. He further observed that he would have accepted the plea of the assessees that the products were animal feed had the product manufactured by them been directly used as such for animals feeding. The claim of the respondents herein was rejected because according to the Collector the products merely were to enhance the performance of livestocks by addition of these supplements to the animal feeds. From this it is evident that the Collector regarded the products in question as animal feed supplements.
5.  On further appeal to the Tribunal it came to the conclusion that animal feed supplements were rightly included in Tariff item 23.02 being preparation of a kind used in animal feeding including dogs and cats food.
We agree with the conclusion of the Tribunal that even food supplements like the products of the respondents which are used in animals feeding would fall under the heading 2302 and, therefore, we do not find any merit in this appeal. While affirming the decision of the Tribunal, this appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.Remaining appeals :
6. For the reasons stated in the judgment above, all other appeals are also dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
