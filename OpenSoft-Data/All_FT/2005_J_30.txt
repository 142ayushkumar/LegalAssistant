Veer Sen v Jai Singh
Supreme Court of India

11 March 2005
Cr.A. No. 403 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 4210 of 2004)
The order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  By the impugned order, the High Court granted bail to Respondent 1 in a case u/s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code (for short "IPC"). It appears that the accused was granted bail after his conviction u/s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code during the pendency of appeal by the High Court and thereafter he has been involved in another case u/s. 302 of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court, while granting bail to this respondent, has not at all considered this fact.
2. In our view, the present case was not a fit one for grant of bail to the respondent.
3.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned order rendered by the High Court, granting bail to the accused Jai Singh, is set aside and he is directed to be taken into custody forthwith for which compliance report must be sent to this Court within a period of one month from the date of receipt of copy of this order by the trial court.
Appeal allowed.
