2.  As we heard the special leave petition, our attention has been drawn to the order passed in SLP(C) No....../1999 (CC No.4437) dated 06.09.1999.
3. It was brought to our notice that the multiplier of 20 had been adopted in this case also by the Land Acquisition Officer himself. Mr. M.P. Vinod, learned counsel pleaded that the same order may be adopted in these SLPs. also. We do not find any reason to take a different view either.
