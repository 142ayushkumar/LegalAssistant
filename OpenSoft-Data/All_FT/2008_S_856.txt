Jakia Nasim Ahesan and another v State of Gujarat and others
Supreme Court of India

3 March 2008
S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 1088 of 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court's order does not render the petitioners remediless. But, various important aspects arise for consideration. In a given case, a person who has knowledge of the commission of a crime may not be examined by the police.
The question is what is the remedy available to such person?
2. We, therefore, issue notice only to Respondents 1 and 2 and the Union of India. Though, in the proceedings, the Central Bureau of Investigation is Respondent 3, there is presently no need for issuing any notice to CBI, as we would like to have the views of the Union of India also.
3.  Mr Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel has agreed to assist the Court as an amicus curiae. We would also request other learned senior members of the Bar to assist the Court, as the question is of vital importance in the administration of criminal justice.
Order accordingly.
