Food Corporation of India v Surendra, Devendra and Mahendra Transport Co.
Supreme Court of India

30 January 2003
C.A. No. 7055 of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In this appeal, learned counsel for the appellant has raised only one contention with regard to issue No.4 decided by the Arbitrator, namely, payment of transport charges for transporting goods cargo. In our view, it cannot be said that Arbitrator has committed an error apparent from the face of the record which calls for our interference. Arbitrator has referred to various letters written by the concerned officers as well as previous practice adopted by the Department since last last 30 years in paying transport charges of goods cargo of warfare basis.
2. Further it appears that no such contention was raised before the High Court on this aspect. In this view of the matter, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court does not call for interference. The appeal is dismissed, accordingly.
Appeal dismissed.
