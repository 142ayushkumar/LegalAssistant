New India Assurance Company Limited v Kamla and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17606/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We heard learned counsel at length. He submitted that there was conscious violation of the policy condition and therefore insurance company cannot be made liable for the award. The policy condition was that no passenger shall be taken for hire or reward. But unfortunately the insurance company had not proved that any passenger had been taken in the vehicle for hire or reward. No evidence had been adduced by the insurance company. The finding of fact is that no passenger was taken in the vehicle for hire.
That finding has been concurred with by the High Court.
2. In the light of the concurrent findings there is no scope for the insurance company now to contend that there was a violation of the policy condition.
Special Leave Petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
