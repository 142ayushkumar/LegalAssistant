Collector of Central Excise, Madras v A. Md. Bilal and Company
Supreme Court of India

22 February 1999
C.A. No. 791 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is a delay of 502 days in filing this appeal. In the application seeking condonation of delay, no explanation, worth the name, let alone a satisfactory or reasonable explanation, has been offered. When faced with this fact situation, learned Attorney General fairly conceded that the manner in which the delay had been caused in filing the appeal warrants an Enquiry and that the Union of India would take appropriate steps in this behalf, more particularly when many such cases, according to the learned Attorney General, have been brought to his notice in recent time. Be that as it may, in the absence of any satisfactory or cogent explanation for delay, the application for condonation of delay is dismissed.
Consequently, the appeal is dismissed as barred by time.
Appeal dismissed.
