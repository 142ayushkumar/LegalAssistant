Kirpal Singh and Others v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 February 2001
I.A. No. 1 In C.A..No.4610/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The order impugned in the appeal was an interlocutory one, by which another order dated 18.3.1997 was stayed during the pendency of writ petition filed before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh.
2.  As both parties agreed that the impugned order dated 8.12.1998 can be set aside, we do so in so far as it affected the operation of the order dated 18.3.1997.
3.  In other words, the status quo as on 18.3.1997 will continue till the disposal of the writ petition.
This appeal is accordingly disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
