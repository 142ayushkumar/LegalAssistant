Jaldhar Mandal v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.)....../2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  Though there is an application for adjourning this matter, but having gone through the impugned judgment of the High Court affirming the conviction of the accused under section 376 and sentencing the accused to imprisonment for 10 years, we see no fruitful purpose would be served for adjourning this matter.
2. The victim PW-9 has given a vivid account of the entire incident and the Doctor, who has been examined in this case, has indicated the age of the victim girl to be 14 years. PW.10, one of the Panch witness, has corroborated, in the sense that the accused was persuaded to marry the victim girl but later on the accused denied.
3.  In these circumstances, we see no justification for our interference with the impugned conviction and sentence. The SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
