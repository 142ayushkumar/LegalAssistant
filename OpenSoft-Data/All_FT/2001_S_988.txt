Vinod Rambali Singh v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

27 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 735/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra after getting instructions informed the Court that the trial in this case is expected to begin on 5.9.01 as the court has already fixed the said date for framing charge.
2.  In view of this development we only want the trial court to expedite the trial particularly because this petitioner (Vinod Rambali Singh)is in jail from 4.6.2000 onwards.
3. We direct the trial court to fix up an appropriate schedule for examination of witnesses on a day-to-day basis. The schedule shall be fixed so as to commence the examination of witnesses within two months from the date of framing of charge.
4.  Learned counsel for the State agrees that summons can be handed over to the public prosecutor who will make arrangements for service of summons so that witnesses can be examined during the period scheduled. We direct the trial court to expedite the trial with utmost promptitude as one of the accused is in jail.
5.  With these observations this SLP is disposed of. A copy of the record of proceedings shall be forwarded to the Registrar of the High Court of Bombay who will intimate the trial judge of these directions forthwith.
Petition disposed of.
