Jabbar Khaja Saudagar v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

5 October 1987
W.P. (Criminal) No. 265 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is not a fit case for interference under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, 1950. It appears that the State Government had considered the case of the petitioner for premature release and made an order in terms of sub-section (1) of Section 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and all other powers enabling it in that behalf. It has remitted only that part of the sentence of imprisonment for life which is in excess of twenty four years of total imprisonment.
2.   It cannot be said that the State Government did not apply its mind or that in the facts and circumstances of the case, its decision was arbitrary or irrational
The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
