Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai-V v Swastik Rayon Processors
Supreme Court of India

29 November 2006
C.As. No. 5223 of 2001 with No. 136 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These two appeals are disposed of by this common order. For the sake of convenience, the facts are taken from Civil Appeal No. 5223 of 2001.
2.  The Revenue, being aggrieved, has filed this appeal under Section 35-L(b) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (for short "the Act") against Final Order No. C-1/574 dated 13-3-2001 passed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, West Zonal Bench at Mumbai passed in Appeal No. E/1115R/96.Bom. By the impugned order the Tribunal has set aside the order passed by the Collector (Central Excise).
3.  The point involved in the present appeal is whether the process of twisting and doubling of cellulosic filament yarn Tariff Item 18-II(w) with a spun yarn [Tariff Item 18-III(H)] comprising of polyester and viscose, amounts to manufacture within the meaning of Section 2(f) of the Act and if so, whether it is classifiable under erstwhile Tariff Item 68 and chargeable to duty therein.
4.  The Collector confirmed the demand for duty issued to the respondent assessee on the ground that the process of twisting and doubling of cellulosic filament yarn with a blended yarn comprising polyester and viscose amounts to manufacture and imposed a penalty on the respondent. He also ordered confiscation of the goods, plant and machinery with an option to redeem them on payment of fine.
5.  The Tribunal has reversed the order of the Collector relying upon the two decisions of this Court in Porritts and Spencer (Asia) Ltd. v. CCE (1995 Indlaw SC 23) and CCE v. Banswara Syntex Ltd. (1996 Indlaw SC 3834) in which it has been held that doubling or multifolding of yarn does not result in the emergence of a new commodity and that the yarn continues to be yarn.
6.  The counsel appearing for the Revenue strenuously argued that this Court has taken contrary views in two different sets of cases. He has referred to Porritts and Spencer (Asia) Ltd. v. CCE (1995 Indlaw SC 23) (supra), CCE v. Banswara Syntex Ltd. (supra); Rajasthan Spg. and Wvg. Mills Ltd. v. CCE (2003 Indlaw SC 81) and CCE v. Madura Coats Ltd. (2005 Indlaw SC 393) which are in favour of the assessee and Aditya Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (1988 Indlaw SC 891), CCE v. Rajasthan Spg. and Wvg. Mills Ltd. (1992 Indlaw SC 8)  and CCE v. Bowreah Cotton Mills Co. Ltd. (1997 Indlaw SC 2393) which are in favour of the Revenue.
7.  The point involved in this appeal has specifically been dealt with by this Court in Porritts and Spencer (Asia) Ltd. (1995 Indlaw SC 23) (supra) which held that doubling or multifolding of yarn does not result in the emergence of a new commodity and that the yarn continues to be yarn and, therefore, this process does not amount to manufacture.
8. Similar is the view taken by this Court in Banswara Syntex Ltd.() (supra), Rajasthan Spg. and Wvg. Mills Ltd. (1992 Indlaw SC 8) (supra) and Madura Coats Ltd. (2005 Indlaw SC 393) (supra) The judgments which have been cited in favour of the Revenue i.e. Aditya Mills Ltd. (1988 Indlaw SC 891) (supra), Rajasthan Spg. and Wvg. Mills Ltd.  (1992 Indlaw SC 8) (supra) and Bowreah Cotton Mills Co. Ltd. (1997 Indlaw SC 2393) (supra) are distinguishable on facts.
9.  It was argued before us that the judgments against the Revenue have not taken note of Aditya Mills Ltd. (1988 Indlaw SC 891) (supra). We do not find any force in the submission made by the counsel for the appellant. The point in issue is concluded against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee by the four decisions of this Court, referred to above, out of which three decisions are by the three Hon'ble Judges.
10. It is true that in Porritts and Spencer (Asia) Ltd. (1995 Indlaw SC 23) (supra) the decision of this Court in Aditya Mills Ltd. (1988 Indlaw SC 891)(supra) was not taken note of but the decision of the Tribunal which was confirmed in Aditya Mills Ltd. (1988 Indlaw SC 891) (supra)had been taken note of and was distinguished.
11.  For the reasons stated above, we do not find any merit in these appeals and dismiss the same leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
Appeals dismissed.
