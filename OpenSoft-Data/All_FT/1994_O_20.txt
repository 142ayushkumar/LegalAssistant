Jewellers Narandas and Sons v Oriental Insurance Company Limited
Supreme Court of India

3 March 1994
C.A. No. 665 of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appellants are manufacturers and exporters of jewellery. The appellants insured a consignment of gold with the respondent-Insurance Company. The delivery of the gold was to be made to a consignee in Kuwait. Due to invasion of Kuwait by the Iraqi forces the consignment was lost/destroyed/stolen from the strong room at the Kuwait Airport. The appellants claimed the insured amount from the Insurance Company. But despite repeated requests by the appellants the claim was not honoured. The appellants filed a petition before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (the Commission).
2.   By a detailed judgment the Commission came to the conclusion that there was no deficiency on the part of the Insurance Company in rendering service to the appellants. We see no ground to interfere with the reasoning and the conclusions reached by the Commission in its judgment.
3.  We further agree with the Commission that the appellants have a remedy to approach the civil court in respect of the appellants' claim against the Insurance Company. The appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
