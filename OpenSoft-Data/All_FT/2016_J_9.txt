Delhi Development Authority v Jagbir Singh and another
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2016
Civil Appeal No. 8510 of 2016
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. It is seen from the judgment of the High Court that the physical possession of the subject land has not been taken. The compensation also has not been paid to the land owner. Hence, the acquisition proceedings have lapsed in view of Section 24(2) the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Therefore, this appeal stands dismissed.
3. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, the appellant is given a period of one year to exercise its liberty granted under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act for initiation of the acquisition proceedings afresh.
4. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
