Rajesh Kumar Soni and others v Ministry of Environment and Forest and Wild Life and others
Supreme Court of India

10 March 1988
Civil W.P. No. 1351 of 1987 (Arising out of W.P. No. 818 of 1989)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. We have also perused the writ petition and two counter-affidavits. It is not disputed that the petitioners have been working in the establishment for more than 4 to 5 years.
2. This gives us the impression that there is regular need for this employment. Though this is the position, petitioners are being continuing as daily-rated employees. We do not think this should be permitted particularly when the wage of daily-rated employees is about half of regular employees.
3.  We direct the opposite-party-respondent to absorb the petitioners on regular basis. If there be any other similarly situated employees senior to them they should be given the same benefit. This should be done within three months. Hence initially the absorption should be against group D posts and as and when permanent opportunity against group C posts opens up, they should be considered.
4.  The writ petition is disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.
Petition disposed of.
