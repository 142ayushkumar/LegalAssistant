Mridul Dhar (Minor) (6) and another v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

13  May  2005
W.Ps. (C) No. 306 of 2004 with No. 308 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The aspect regarding increasing of all-India quota from 15% to 20%, inclusion of seats under Section 10-A of the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Act, 1993 while calculating 15% all-India quota and constitution of High-Powered Committee and/or appointment of ombudsman would be considered after the counselling in respect of Academic Year 2005-2006, is complete. Regarding counselling by videoconferencing, we are of the view that, at the first instance, on an experiment basis, videoconferencing can commence between Delhi and Rajasthan as indicated in para 14, of Annexure 'A', to the affidavit of Prof. Sanjay Shrivastava filed in January 2005. If successful, counselling by videoconferencing can be introduced to other States as well from the next Academic Year 2006-2007.
2. However, we permit the Director General of Health Services to revert back to normal one-to-one counselling in case any difficulty is felt while conducting counselling by videoconferencing.
3.  The States of Manipur, Tripura, Chhattisgarh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh may file their affidavits within two days. Two weeks' time is allowed to the States of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa to file the requisite affidavits.
List the matter in the month of August 2005.
Order accordingly.
