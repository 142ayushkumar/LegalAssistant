Jitendra Singh v Mange Ram and another
Supreme Court of India

12 September 2005
Cr.A. No. 1172 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 97 of 2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the parties.
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 1-12- 2004 of the High Court of Allahabad granting bail to the accused Mange Ram in Crime No. 298 of 2004 under Sections 147/148/149/307/302 IPC registered at PS Chapraula, District Baghpat. From the FIR it appears that the accused Mange Ram exhorted the other accused and said that let us today do away with this Yogendra. Therefore, there is direct evidence against the accused Mange Ram. We are, therefore, of the view that the High Court committed an error in releasing the accused Mange Ram on bail. The High Court's order dated 1-12-2004 granting bail to the accused Mange Ram is set aside. The accused Mange Ram shall be taken into custody forthwith.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
