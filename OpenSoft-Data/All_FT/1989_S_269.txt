Suresh Chandra Saxena v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 February 1989
Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 26226 of 1988 (Arising out of W.P. No. 11162 of 1984)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard the petitioner-in-person and Mrs. Dikshit for the State of Uttar Pradesh. From the order dated October 11, 1984, it is clear that the petitioner is entitled to go back to his former post which was that of Kurk Amin on commission basis. It is the stand of the State Government that pursuant to the order of this Court on December 5, 1985 the District Assistant Registrar of Cooperative Societies restored the petitioner to his post as cooperative Kurk Amin on commission basis.
2.   The petitioner says that he had submitted a joining report but has not been assigned work. Mrs. Dikshit says that there is no material on record which would show that he had given his joining report.
3.  The grievance of the petitioner as we gather seems to be he should be given monthly salary. That was not what this Court directed. If the petitioner is interested in joining the service he is free to give a fresh joining report and on such joining report being given, Mrs. Dikshit agrees before us that under the Cooperative Scheme work will be provided to him. The formalities as required by the rules shall be completed before the petitioner takes to work.
The civil miscellaneous petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
