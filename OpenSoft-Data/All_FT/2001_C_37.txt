Shree Sitaram Charity Trust and Others v Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 February 2001
(For clarification of Ct.'s order Dt. 1.5.2000) (Along with Office Report )
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On July 15, 1999 this Court directed that the rent due to respondent no.7 as well as to the petitioners would stand attached in favour of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The stay order was not vacated subsequently. On May 1, 2000, while disposing of the special leave petitions, this Court directed the 7th respondent to deposit with the Municipal authorities the arrears of rent from July 1997 within four weeks from that day and it was made clear that such a deposit would be to the account of the petitioner towards payment of municipal taxes. The liability was also extended to deposit future rent likewise.
2.  In these applications for clarification of the said order, it is submitted that the 7th respondent is not depositing the rent payable to him by his sub-tenants.Therefore, a clarification is required to be made by this Court making it clear that the liability of the 7th respondent subsists for deposit of the rents which he is receiving from his sub-tenants.
3.  Heard learned counsel for the Municipal authorities as well as the 7th respondent. Inasmuch as the rent due to the 7th respondent stood attached by virtue of the order of this Court dated July 15, 1997, the 7th respondent has no right to appropriate the same. He has to pay it only to the Municipality towards the discharge of liability of paying municipal taxes.  However, this payment of rent would be limited to the liability which the 7th respondent would have to discharge towards the difference of taxes on account of sub-letting the premises.
With these observations, the I.A.s are disposed of.
Applications disposed of.
