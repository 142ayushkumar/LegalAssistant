2.  We have perused the application (CMP No.224/98) in arbitration appeal No.57 of 1991 which was filed by the petitioner in the High Court on 13th November 1998. That application does not explain the cause of delay.
3. Let alone offering a satisfactory explanation, no explanation which is even plausible or reasonable has been offered.
