P. Vijaya Rajan v State of Tamil Nadu and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 October 1991
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 6449 of 1990 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 27 October 1989 of the High Court of Madras in W.A. No. 1410 of 1987)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Counsel for the petitioner pointed out that the question is as to whether a sponsored and taken over society by government is State within Article 12 of the Constitution of India, 1950.
2.  In the case before us it is not the petitioner's allegation that the society in question was sponsored by government though admittedly its administration had been taken over within the framework of the Cooperative Societies Act. According to us the ambit of reference made on May 8, 1989 to a Constitution Bench by the Vacation Judge does not apply to the facts of this case.
3.  We would accordingly decline to refer it to a Constitution Bench or even link it up with that case and direct that the petition be dismissed. It is open to the petitioner to seek such relief as is open to him under law and to plead for condonation of delay.
Petition dismissed.
