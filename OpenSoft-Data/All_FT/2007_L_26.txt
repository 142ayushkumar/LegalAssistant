Lallu Parsad Pandey v Surinder Kumar and others
Supreme Court of India

22 January 2007
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No(s). 9720/2006
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Recording the fact that the High Court had dismissed the Revision Petition in a summary manner, this Court issued notice limited to the point as to why the matter be not remitted back to the High Court for fresh disposal by a reasoned order.
2.  Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and in view of the facts and circumstances of the instant case, we are of the opinion that several arguable points were raised in the Revision Petition and the High Court was not justified in dismissing the same summarily.
3. Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside and the case is remitted back to the High Court. The High Court shall dispose of the Revision Petition on merits, in accordance with law, by passing a speaking order, after affording due opportunity of being heard to the parties.
The appeal stands disposed of accordingly. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
