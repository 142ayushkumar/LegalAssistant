Prem Family Private (Specific) Trust v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

9 February 1996
C.A. No. ... of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 25112 of 1995)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have perused the Tribunal's order. It is clear that no question of law arises out of the Tribunal's order and the only question involved is a pure question of fact regarding genuineness of the Trust.
In the facts of the present case, no occasion arose for application of any principle of law at any stage for deciding this question relating to the genuineness of the Trust and, therefore, there was no basis to hold that a question of law arises out of the Tribunal's order.
2.    The impugned order made by the High Court allowing the Revenue's application under Section 256(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 has, therefore, to be set aside
Consequently, the appeal is allowed.
3.   The impugned order of the High Court is set aside resulting in dismissal of the Revenue's application under Section 256(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. No costs.
Appeal Allowed.
