Nanak v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

1 February 1983
Cr.A. No. 228 of 1974 (Government Appeal No. 1607 of 1970, D/- 10 April 1974, (All)), Dt. 1 February 1983.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court by which the acquittal of the appellant Nanak was set aside and he was convicted u/s. 302 I.P.C. and sentenced to imprisonment for life.
2.  The main witness who proved the occurrence were P.W. 1 Kundan, P.W. 2 Fakira and P.W. 4 Kanha, Sohanlal P.W. 5 an immediate neighbour of the accused saw the accused running away with a knife P.W. 1 also an independent witness and the enmity suggested is an old one. The learned Sessions Judge has disbelieved these witness as being interested and having enmity with the accused. After going through the judgment of the High Court, we are satisfied that the judgment of the Sessions Judge was absolutely perverse and there is no evidence on the basis of which the appellant could have been acquitted. The High Court has made correct approach to the case. It was suggested by the counsel for the appellant that no motive had been proved. In the first place it has been stated by P.W. 1 Kundan that relations between husband and wife were not cordial. In a case of murder of the wife by the husband there are many considerations which have to be looked into and it is very difficult to know the exact motives in the circumstances of a given case.
3.  For these reasons therefore, we are satisfied that the prosecution has been able to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. This is not a case in which it can be said that the view taken by the Sessions Judge is reasonably possible. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
