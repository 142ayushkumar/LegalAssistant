Union of India and Anr v Hanifa Begum
Supreme Court of India

24 September 2001
I.A. No.3 In C.A. No.2033/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the appellant-Union of India submitted that the correct address of the unserved respondent could not be furnished as the said respondent had changed her address and it became a matter of great difficulty for the officers of the Union of India to trace out the new address to which she changed.
2.  We are inclined to give one more chance to the appellant as the new address has now been traced out and furnished.
We, therefore, allow this I.A. and restore the Civil Appeal.
Issue notice to the unserved respondent. Dasti is also permitted.
Application allowed.
