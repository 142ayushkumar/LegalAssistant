Ashita Pancholia v Viral M. Pancholia
Supreme Court of India

14  May  2008
TP (C) No. 7 of 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  When the transfer petition was taken up, learned counsel of both the parties submitted that IA No. 2 of 2008 had been filed jointly by the parties praying for conversion of the suit under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 to one under Section 13-B, and thereafter, to waive the waiting period of six months and to grant a divorce on that basis.
2.  Mr Divan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner wife, has referred to two decisions of this Court in:
(i) Swati Verma v. Rajan Verma 2003 Indlaw SC 967 and
(ii) Sanghamitra Ghosh v. Kajal Kumar Ghosh 2006 Indlaw SC 775 where in a similar situation, this Court had come to the conclusion that since the marriage had broken down irretrievably, there would be no useful purpose in continuing with the same.
3.  Since the circumstances in this case are almost identical to those in the two cases cited before us, we allow the application, being IA No. 2 of 2008, and grant the relief prayed for, as indicated herein below:
"(a) Convert the suit filed under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 being M.J. Petition No. A-2152 of 2007 pending in the Family Court at Bandra-Kurla Complex, Bandra (East), Mumbai into a suit for divorce by mutual consent under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955;
(b) Dissolve the marriage of the petitioner and the respondent solemnised on 26-6-2004 by a decree of divorce by mutual consent under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act".
4.  Consequently, the transfer petition as also the pending suit under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act are no longer relevant, and are dismissed as infructuous.
Petition dismissed.
