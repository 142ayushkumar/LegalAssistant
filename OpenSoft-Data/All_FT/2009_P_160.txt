Mohammad Salim v Principal, Nirmala Convent HIG.SEC.SCL.and others
Supreme Court of India

6 July 2009
Civil Appellate Jurisdiction Review Petition (C) No. 999 of 2009, In S.L.P. (Civil) No. 5939 of 2009
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. The above SLP was heard and dismissed on 30.3.2009 without issuing notice as the petitioner was not able to convince us that the first respondent minority institution did not have absolute freedom in matters of admissions and student discipline u/art. 30 of the Constitution of India.
2. The review petition filed in the matter expresses an apprehension that one of the judges was biased against the petitioner during hearing. This Court has always maintained that justice should not only be done but should appear to have been done. In view of the apprehension expressed by the petitioner, we are of the view that the matter should be heard by another Bench.
3. We, therefore, withdraw the order of dismissal dated 30.3.2009 and request the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India to place the special leave petition before another Bench for consideration.
4. During the hearing, certain observations were made by one of us (Justice Markandey Katju). His intentions were not to offend anyone. However, if anyone's feelings have been hurt, he apologises and expresses his regrets in the matter.
Order accordingly
