Raghbir Singh v Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Hauz Khas and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3644/2001

1.The Order of the Court was as follows:
2.  Mr. Jaspal Singh, learned senior counsel submitted that the Sub Divisionsal Magistrate in the final order passed in proceedings under Section 145 of the Cr.P.C. has done grave wrong to the petitioner by ordering the possession of the subject matter of dispute to respondent nos. 2 and 3, overlooking the fact that the Civil Court refused to grant an ad interim injunction in favour of those respondents.
3.  We permit the petitioner to move the Civil Court for any interim order concerning the subject matter in dispute. If any order is passed by the Civil Court , that order will override the orders passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate in proceedings under Section 145 of the Cr.P.C.
With these observations the SLP is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
