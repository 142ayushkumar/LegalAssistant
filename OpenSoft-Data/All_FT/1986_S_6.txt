1.  These writ petitions have become infructuous since the students for the enforcement of whose fundamental right under Article 19 (1) (c) of the Constitution these writ petitions have been filed have already completed their studies in the college and there is no longer any question of their being required compulsorily to pay the subscription for membership of the Rajasthan University Students Council.
2.   We do not therefore propose to go into the interesting question whether freedom of association under Article 19 (1) (c) also includes within it freedom not to join an association or union. That question may have to be considered at some future point of time. We would therefore make no order on these writ petitions.
Petitions disposed of.
