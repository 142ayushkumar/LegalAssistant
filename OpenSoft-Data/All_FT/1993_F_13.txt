Francisco Almeida v Board Of Trustees Of Port Of Mormugao
Supreme Court of India

27 April 1993
S.L.P. (C) No. 3996 of 1993 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 7 October 1992 of the High Court of Bombay at Panaji, Goa in W.P. No. 256 of 1987)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Mr V.J. Francis, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that on an incorrect interpretation of the relevant regulation the petitioner is being required to obtain a no-objection certificate from all the steamer agents for the purpose of getting the license of shipchandler. It is urged that the only requirement under the regulations is to obtain a no-objection certificate from the Customs authorities and that after obtaining the license the petitioner can obtain a letter of permission from a steamer agent to carry on business as a shipchandler. From the judgment of the High Court it does not appear that a no-objection certificate is required to be obtained from all the steamer agents for the purpose of getting a licence as a shipchandler.
2.  The High Court, while considering the reasonableness of the regulation has held that since shipchandling is a business which involves supply of food items to the vessels which are berthed at the Port, the provision for no-objection certificate from ship's agent can be held to be reasonable. This means that for working as a shipchandler under the regulations a no-objection letter from the steamer agent for the vessel is required. Keeping in view the said requirement, the petitioner can submit the application for license which may be considered in accordance with the regulations.
3.  With these observations, the special leave petition is dismissed. Court Master +From the Judgment and Order dated 7-10-1992 of the High Court of Bombay at Panaji, Goa in W.P. No. 256 of 1987
