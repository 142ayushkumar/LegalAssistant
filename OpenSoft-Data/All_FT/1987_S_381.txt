Ashfaq Ullah v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 January 1987
W.P. (Civil) No. 1239 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We have heard learned counsel for both the parties. Admittedly, the scheme was published under Section 68-C of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 under Notification No. 1190-A/XXX-A-872-65 dated September 26, 1967 in the year 1967 in respect of routes (i) Banda-Baberu-Attarra, (ii) Banda-Baberu Kamasin and (iii) Banda-Baberu-Augesi and the approved scheme has not been published either with or without modification under Section 68-D of the Act.
2. We are not satisfied with the explanation given on behalf of the respondents for the inordinate delay in finalising the proceedings pursuant to the draft scheme which was published in the year 1967.
3. We, therefore, following the several decisions already rendered by this Court quash the impugned notification in which the draft scheme was published, reserving the liberty to the U.P. State Road Transport Corporation to publish a fresh scheme, if it is so advised, in respect of the routes in question. If the Corporation or any of the parties has been issued any permit, under Section 68-F(1-A) or 68-F(1-C) of the Act, as the case may be, they are permitted to operative their services under those permits till the expiry of July 10, 1987.
4. The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
