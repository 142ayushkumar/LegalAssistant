State of Gujarat and Another v Pwd Employees Union and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 September 1999
C.A. No. 8577 of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having heard learned Senior Counsel Shri. Dholakia for the appellant State, we do not think that this is a fit case for our interference.
2.  The sole question is whether PWD is an industry and therefore governed under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
3. This question is squarely covered by a decision of the Constitution Bench in the case of Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board v. A. Rajappa 1978 Indlaw SC 2601978 Indlaw SC 2601978 Indlaw SC 260.
4.  It is true that earlier a Bench of two learned Judges wanted this decision to be reconsidered but that reference has been sent back by a larger Bench of this Court and the decision in the case of Bangalore Water Supply 1978 Indlaw SC 2601978 Indlaw SC 260.
No costs.
Order accordingly.
