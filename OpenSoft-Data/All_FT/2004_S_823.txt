Hari Singh and Another v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2004
Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3510/2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties on the application for grant of bail.
2.  The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the appellants were on bail during the trial and they had also the benefit of bail when the criminal appeal was pending before the High Court; they have not misused the bail granted to them till now.
3.  Learned counsel for the respondent-State urged that in view of the concurrent findings, convicting the appellants, bail may not be granted.
Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and also keeping in view the fact that the appellants were on bail before the trial court and also when the criminal appeal was pending before the High Court, we think it is just and appropriate to grant bail to the appellants.
4.  Hence, both the appellants are granted bail, on the same terms and conditions on which the bail was granted to them by the trial court to the satisfaction of the trial court.
Petition allowed.
