Supreme Court of India

3 July 2006
Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No(s).11013/2005 WITH SLP(C) NO. 11281 of 2005 SLP(C) NO. 11310 of 2005 SLP(C) NO. 11314 of 2005 , CIVIL APPEAL NOS.2764, 2765 and 2766 OF 2006
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. These matters relate to fee fixation in the medical and physiotherapy colleges. The question of fixation of fee now stands settled by judgment of this Court in P.A.Inamdar Vs. State of Maharashtra [(2005) 6 SCC 537 2005 Indlaw SC 463]. In the light of the said judgment, the impugned judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained and the fee is required to be fixed by the Fee Fixation Committee having regard to the decision in P.A.Inamdar' s case 2005 Indlaw SC 463 (supra). Accordingly, we set aside the impugned judgment and remit the matter relating to fee fixation for the Academic Years 2003-2004, 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 to the Fee Fixation Committee for fresh fixation of fee in the light of the judgment in P.A.Inamdar's case 2005 Indlaw SC 463 (supra). It would also be open to the colleges to seek appropriate interim directions from the Committee in respect of the amounts for the year 2005-2006.
Similarly, it would be open to the students or their representatives/associations to plead before the Committee that the Management has not complied with the directions already made and seek appropriate directions in that regard. Both these aspects would be considered by the Committee and appropriate directions issued.
3. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
