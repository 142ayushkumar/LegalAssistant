Abdul Gafoor v Muddappa Reddy (Dead) By LRs. and Another
Supreme Court of India

8 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16025-16026/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Service is complete.
Leave granted.
1.  A regular first appeal was filed by the appellant before the High Court after delay of 1585 days. That was sought to be explained through I.A.No.1 in RFA No.224/99.
2. That application happened to be dismissed for non-remittance of the process fee by order dated 18.6.1999. Appellant moved an application for recalling the said order. When that application was considered the High Court dismissed it on the ground that there was no satisfactory explanation for the long delay of 1585 days.
3.  We do not think that the High Court should have made that observation when the High Court was only called upon to consider whether the order dated 18.6.1999 was to be upset or not. The said order happened to be passed only on the ground of default in remittance of the process fee. Counsel now explained that the process fee -2- could not be remitted in time due to some lapse and that may be condoned. We do not want to adopt a technical stand in the matter. We set aside the order dated 18.6.1999. The High Court now has to consider I.A.No.1 which was filed for condoning the delay of 1585 days.
4.  Though arguments have been addressed before us and learned counsel for the respondent addressed arguments in counter thereon we deem it necessary that the High Court should exercise its mind in the matter, since the High Court has not done it so far. We, therefore allow this appeal and set aside the order dated 18.6.1999 as well as 30.6.1999. While disposing of IA No.1 in RFA No.224/99, the High Court shall not be influenced by the observations made in the order dated 30.6.99.These appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
