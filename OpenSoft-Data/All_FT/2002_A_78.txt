Simi Mehrotra v Anil Mehrotra
Supreme Court of India

5 August 2002
Transfer Petition (C) No. 870 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This is a transfer petition by the wife. She seeks transfer of Case No. HMA 105 of 2001 titled Anil Mehrotra v. Simi Mehrotra, filed by the respondent husband for dissolution of marriage, which is pending before the District Court, Delhi. She states that she is living with her aged parents and there is no one else to accompany her so it is not possible for her to travel from Allahabad on each date of hearing to attend the court in Delhi.
2. The fact that the petitioner is residing in Allahabad with her aged parents is not disputed by the respondent.
3.  In view of this fact, we consider it just and proper to order that Case No. HMA 105 of 2001 be transferred from the District Court, Delhi to the Family Court, Allahabad.
The transfer petition is accordingly ordered. No costs.
Petition allowed.
