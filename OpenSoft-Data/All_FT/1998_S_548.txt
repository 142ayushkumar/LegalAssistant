3 April 1998
S.L.Ps. (Cr.) No. 1609 of 1997 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 19 March 1997 in Cr.R No. 2463 of 1995 of the High Court of Calcutta) with No. 1705 of 1997
The Order of the Court is as follows:
RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS
1.  Our attention has been drawn by the learned counsel for the petitioner that there are conflicting decisions of this Court in respect of interpretation of S. 167(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure as applicable to the State of West Bengal rendered in State of W. B. v. Falguni Dutta  1993 Indlaw SC 17251993 Indlaw SC 1725 and Durgesh Chandra Saha v. Bimal Chandra Saha  1995 Indlaw SC 8581995 Indlaw SC 858.
2. It has been submitted by the learned counsel that in the earlier decision, the effect of the West Bengal Amendment Act has not been specifically taken into consideration but in the latter judgment such amendment has been considered by this Court. Be that as it may, in view of such conflicting decisions of this Court, it is only desirable that the correct legal position should be decided by a larger Bench so as to avoid any conflict feature. This matter, therefore, be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for referring to a larger Bench.
Order accordingly.
