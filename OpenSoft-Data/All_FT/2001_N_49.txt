The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We find that the appointment of the Receiver was made in this case wihtout any application being moved in this regard. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the Court has Suo Moto power, even no such application is made.
2.  We do not find, on the facts and circumstances of this case, even if there is such power, it is a fit case that the court should have exercised this power.
3. The appeal has merit. The impugned order dated 10th January, 2000 in C.R.P.No.145/99 is set aside.
The appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
