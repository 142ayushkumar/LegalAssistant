W.P. (Cr.) No. 68 of 2008, with Contempt Petition No.....of 2008 (D. No. 26722/2008) in Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 12758 of 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  One of the questions which has been posed in this writ  petition is as to whether, upon receipt of information by an officer in-charge of the police station disclosing cognizable offence, it is imperative  for him/her to register a case under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure, 1973, or a discretion lies with him/her to make some sort of  preliminary enquiry before registering the same.
2. In support of his  submission, Mr. S.B. Upadhyay, learned senior counsel appearing on  behalf of the petitioner, has placed reliance upon two-Judge Bench  decisions of this Court in State of Haryana and Ors. vs. Bhajan Lal 1990 Indlaw SC 91, Ramesh Kumari vs. State (N.C.T. of Delhi) and  Ors. 2006 Indlaw SC 139 and Prakash Singh Badal and Anr. vs. State of  Punjab and Ors. 2006 Indlaw SC 941.
3.  Mr. Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel appearing on  behalf of State of Maharashtra, on the other hand, submitted that an  officer in-charge of the police station is not obliged under law, upon   receipt of information disclosing cognizable offence, to register a case but a discretion lies with him/her in appropriate cases to hold some sort of preliminary enquiry in relation to the veracity or otherwise of the accusations made in the report.  In support of his submission, learned counsel placed reliance upon two-Judge Bench decisions of this Court in P. Sirajuddin Etc. vs. State of Madras Etc. 1970 Indlaw SC 339, Sevi and Anr. vs. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr. 1981 Indlaw SC 36, Shashikant vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors. 2006 Indlaw SC 1447 and Rajinder Singh Katoch vs. Chandigarh Administration and Ors. 2007 Indlaw SC 1308, apart from certain observations made in a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Bhagwant Kishore Joshi 1963 Indlaw SC 268.
4.  In view of the conflicting decisions of this Court, referred to above, we feel that it is necessary to refer the matter to a larger Bench.
5.  Let this petition be placed before Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for passing appropriate orders to list the case before a larger Bench.
6.  In view of the interim order passed by this Court, we feel that it would be expedient to hear this petition at an early date.
Order accordingly.
