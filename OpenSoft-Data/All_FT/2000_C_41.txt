Arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) No. 14804/1999, Dt. 7 August 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  After hearing appellant in person and learned senior Counsel for the respondents, Shri V. R. Reddy, we are of the view that there is some merit in the contention raised by the appellant in this appeal. According to the statement of claim furnished by the appellant to the Bank, he claimed various amounts as follows:
(a) Difference in basic pay of Rs. 860 of January 21, 1981 upto January 7, 1982 and Rs. 1,200 from January 8, 1982 and Rs. 1,270 of January 21, 1982 i.e. Rs. 1, 270-860 Rs. 410 upto February 1, 1983 for 12 months and Rs. 4,920 for 1 month in January, 1982 Rs. 340 - Rs. 5,260
2. Less: Officiating allowance of Rs. 100 from January 8, 1982 to February 1, 1983 - Rs. 1,300 Rs. 3,960
(b) Difference of 3 annual increments viz., January 21, 1982, January 1, 1983 and fitment in increment of February 1, 1983 on the basis of retrospective revision of basic pay from Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 1,800 @ Rs. 300/- from February 1, 1983 to January 31, 1989 (Date of superannuation retirement) for 72 months Rs. 21,600
(c) Gratuity difference @ Rs. 300/- for 13 months Rs. 3,900
(d) PF difference @ 10% on Rs. 21, 000 Bank's contribution Rs. 2.160
(e) Difference in overall emoluments on account of pay revision of Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 1,800 and subsequent revision on November 87 on account of 3 increments due to enhancement in DA and HRA etc. @ Rs. 150/- for 72 months Rs. 10,800 - Rs. 42,420 -
3.  In addition to the above amount, the appellant has claimed punitive interest at the rate of 24% from January 31, 1989, the date of his retirement.
4.  On an earlier occasion, the Bank was prepared to pay Rs. 40,000/- to the appellant towards the main claim and no interest, but appellant was not agreeable.The question therefore, is now with regard to the interest. We are not inclined to grant interest at 24% as claimed by the appellant. However, we are of the view that the appellant is entitled to interest at the rate of 12%. Now the question is from what date the interest will have to be paid. We are of the view that interest will have to be paid from the date the appellant filed the writ petition in this Court, namely C.W.P. No. 512/1993.
5. There will be an order in favour of the appellant for payment of Rs. 42,420/- with interest at the rate of 12% from the date on which the Writ Petition No. 512/1993 was filed in this Court.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
