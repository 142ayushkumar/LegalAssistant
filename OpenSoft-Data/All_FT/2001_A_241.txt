Pyarelal Sankhwar v Arun Kumari Kori and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11584/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Learned counsel for the first respondent states that the allegation of corrupt practices is given up and will not be pressed at any stage. In view thereof, the order under challenge, insofar as it relates to the allegation of corrupt practices and an affidavit in regard thereto, must be set aside.
2.  It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the allegation of corrupt practices having been given up, there is nothing that survives in the election petition. If that is the case, the appellant may move the High Court for appropriate relief.
The civil appeal is allowed accordingly.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
