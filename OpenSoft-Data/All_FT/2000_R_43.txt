Union of India and Others v R.P. Tripathi and Anr
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12114/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after examining the impugned order of the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench, we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that the High Court was totally in error in directing the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan to pay the arrear salary as well as to pay the regular monthly salary of the employees and we therefore quash the same.
2.  Mr. Muralidhar says that against the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal the Writ Petition filed by the Union of India and Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is pending. The High Court is requested to dispose of the same at an early date. Needless to mention that the contempt proceedings filed before the Tribunal would stand stayed.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
