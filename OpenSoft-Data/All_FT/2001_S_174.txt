Raj Kumar v Savitri Devi
Supreme Court of India

25 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12447/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  On the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that the courts below were not right to strike out the defence of the appellant. It seems, the courts have not gone into evidence to assess the veracity of the stand taken by the appellant. At this stage, the court has to see whether there is any stateable or contestable case on behalf of the appellant or not.
2. We find the present case to be such in which the court should not have struck out the defence. Accordingly, both the impugned orders of the trial court and the High Court declining to grant leave to defend are hereby set aside.
3.  After looking to the facts that this case is pending since long, we observe, the courts below shall dispose of this matter expeditiously. The arrears of rent, if not paid, shall be paid within four weeks from today. The appeal is accordingly allowed. Costs on the parties.
Appeal allowed.
