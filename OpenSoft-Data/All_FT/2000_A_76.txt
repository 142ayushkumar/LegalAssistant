Agra Development Authority v Sayeed Khan
Supreme Court of India

11 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14974/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, we are fully convinced that in this case the award which was given by the Labour Court which was ex parte should have been recalled because of the negligence on the part of the counsel who was appearing when his son was appearing on the other side.
2. We, accordingly, allow this appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court as well as the ex parte award of the Labour Court under the Industrial Disputes Act 
 being Adjudication Case No. 361/1993.
The Labour Court will now decide the Adjudication Case afresh after notice to the parties.
Appeal allowed.
