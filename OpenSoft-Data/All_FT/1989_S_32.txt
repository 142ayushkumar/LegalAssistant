Saybu Maruti Ghadge v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

6 February 1989
Cr.A. No. 85 of 1989
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The appellant was convicted by the trial court for an offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code for having murdered his wife. He was awarded punishment of life imprisonment by the trial court. Aggrieved the appellant filed appeal before the High Court under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.
2.   The High Court disposed of the appeal in one paragraph indicating its agreement with the findings recorded by the trial court.
3.  We are shocked and surprised that in a matter where life dealt with the matter in such a summary manner. The High Court, in our opinion, should have considered the evidence in detail to evaluate the credibility of the testimony of the witnesses and it should have discussed the circumstantial evidence on the basis of which the appellant was convicted. Where no eye-witnesses are available to give ocular testimony of the evidence, the court is under a duty to consider in detail every circumstance pressed into service by the prosecution, to records its findings.
4.   In an appeal filed in the High Court against the order of conviction especially where a life sentence is awarded, the High Court is under a duty to consider the matter in detail, it is not proper or advisable to dispose of such an appeal in a summary manner.
5.  We, accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and remit the matter back to it to dispose of the appeal in accordance with law at an early date.
Appeal allowed.
