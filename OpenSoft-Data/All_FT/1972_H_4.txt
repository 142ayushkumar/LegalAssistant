Benaras Electric Light and Power Company Limited v Hanuman Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 March 1972
C.A. No. 164 of 1968,
The Judgment was delivered by : GROVER, J.
1.  This is an appeal by special leave from an award of the Labour Court (I), Kanpur.
2.  The material facts in this appeal are substantially similar to those in the connected appeal, i.e., Civil Appeal No. 1734 of 1967 (U.P.) Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. T. N. Chatterjee, reported at 1972 Indlaw SC 385 ] supra). In this case also the standing orders were certified on July 14, 1951. Cl. 32 of those orders provided for retirement at the age of 55 years or on completion of 30 years' service. The union representing the workmen filed an appeal from the order of the certifying officer which was dismissed on September 22, 1951. On February 15, 1960, notices were served on 17 workmen to the effect that they had attained the age of superannuation and/or completed 30 years' service and, therefore, they were to be retired compulsorily.
3. On March 2, 1960 an order of reference was made by the State Government under S.4(K) of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Labour Court was required to decide the following dispute :
"Whether the employers have wrongfully and unjustifiably terminated the services of the workmen mentioned in the annexures with effect from February 16, 1960. If so, to what relief are the workmen entitled ?"
4. On May 30, 1960, the Labour Court rejected the workmen's claim. On June 14, 1960, the workmen moved for modification of cl. 32 of the Standing Orders. In October 1960, the High Court was moved under Art. 226 of the Constitution by the workmen for quashing the award. On April 22, 1961, cl. 32 of the Standing Orders was modified by the certifying officer and he fixed the age of retirement or superannuation at 58 years. On October 10, 1961, the appellate authority reduced the age of superannuation to 55 years. On July 12, 1966, the High Court while allowing the writ petition quashed the award and directed that the Labour Court should rehear the case and give a fresh award in accordance with law. Ultimately, the award under appeal was given.
5.  A number of issues were framed by the Labour Court. After deciding them it was held that only one of the workmen, namely, S. R. V. Iyer, had entered the service of the appellant in the year 1954, i.e., after the application of the provisions of cl. 32 of Standing Orders. That being the position cl. 32 had been rightly applied to him and the termination of his service could not be assailed and he was not entitled to any relief. As regards the other 16 workmen their retirement was set aside and it was declared that they were entitled to reinstatement with full back wages. Out of 16 workmen 4, whose names are mentioned in the award, had died and, therefore, the question of their reinstatement did not arise but it was declared that they were entitled to full wages for the period from February 16, 1960, till their death.
6.  All the points which have been pressed in this appeal stand disposed of by our judgment in C.A. No. 1734 of 1967 (U. P. Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. T. N. Chatterjee, 1972 Indlaw SC 385 ]) supra, delivered today.
7. In the result, the award of the Labour Court is hereby set aside. The concerned workmen shall be entitled to full wages and all other dues in terms of their employment till they attained the age of 58 years. As regards any payments received by the workmen pursuant to the award and after the notice of termination those shall also be adjusted accordingly. The appellant undertakes not to claim refund of any amounts which have already been received by them even in excess of the amounts due. No order as to costs.
Appeal Disposed of.
