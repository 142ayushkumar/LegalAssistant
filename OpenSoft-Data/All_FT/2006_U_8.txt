D. S. Mathur and Another v U. P. State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. and Others
Supreme Court of India

3  May  2006
CIVIL APPEAL NO(s). 6985 OF 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Heard the parties.
2. In this case, notice confined to the question as to why the order dated 31.12.1999 passed by the District Magistrate, Ghaziabad/Arbitrator be not treated as an Award and the application u/s. 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 preferred before the District Judge should have been decided on merits and should not have been dismissed as simply not maintainable.
3. The learned District Judge has dismissed the application merely on the ground that it is not maintainable.
The High Court was of the view that the order impugned is appealable u/s. 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and, therefore, the remedy to the petitioner is to move an application u/s. 34 of the Act.
4. This being the position, we now dispose of this petition with a direction to the District Judge, Ghaziabad to treat the order dated 31.12.1999 as an Award and an application filed u/s. 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before it should be treated as objections to the Award and the same shall be decided on merit.
5. For the convenience of the parties, we fix 4th July, 2006 for the appearance of the parties. We make it clear that the parties shall be at liberty to agitate any point of law before the District Judge, Ghaziabad. The orders passed by the High Court and by the District Judge are, accordingly, set aside. Since the matter is pending for quite some time the District Judge, Ghaziabad shall dispose of the petition expeditiously.
Order accordingly
