Voice of People v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 July 1990
W.P. (Criminal) No. 737 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The general question raised in this writ petition is whether any specific time frame for the trial and disposal of criminal cases must be held to be implicit in or enjoined by Article 21.
2. This question, it would appear, has been referred to a Constitution Bench in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 268 of 1987 and connected matters
3. Since the very question is to be considered by a Constitution Bench this separate petition on the same question becomes redundant. However, the petitioner through its learned counsel may seek permission of the Constitution Bench to intervene and make its submission of law.
4. With these observations the writ petition is dismissed
Petition dismissed.
