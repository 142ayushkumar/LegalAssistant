12 August 2002
IA No. 199 in C.A. No. 560 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for NDMC as also the learned Solicitor General, we clarify that our earlier order shall not come in the way of the hawkers/squatters being dislodged from the vicinity of the Reserve Bank of India building in the event of authorities arriving at a decision that it was necessary to do so in view of the heightened security threat. Such hawkers/squatters shall be given a reasonable previous warning, howsoever short, before being physically removed.
2. However, the municipal authorities/agencies shall at the earliest identify an alternate place where such hawkers/squatters can be accommodated. For the purpose of identifying the alternate site the hawkers/squatters who are stated to be about thirty in number shall be given a hearing through a representative.
List after four weeks.
Order accordingly.
