Amitadyuti Kumar v State of W.B. and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 January 2000
Civil Appeal No. 467 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
3. The Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court has directed payment of compensation to the tune of Rs. 20,000 to the widow of deceased Debu Pramanik in lieu of compensation granted by the Human Rights Commission.
4. When the matter came up before this Court, a limited notice was issued on the question of compensation.
5. Learned counsel for the appellant forcefully contends that the quantum of compensation to the tune of Rs. 20,000 is too meagre even to have a sustenance for the widow and the other family members and at least the compensation should be enhanced to the tune of Rs. 1.5 lac.
6. The counsel for the State of West Bengal on the other hand contends that the Human Rights Commission of the State has considered the matter from all angles including the profession which was being pursued by the deceased before his custodial death and therefore, the compensation to the tune of Rs. 20,000 is adequate. Having considered the rival submissions and on the findings arrived at by the High Court of Calcutta, we think it appropriate to enhance the compensation to Rs. 70,000. Since Rs. 20,000 has already been paid, the State of West Bengal is directed to pay another sum of Rs. 50,000 to the widow of deceased Debu Pramanik within a period of eight weeks from today. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
7. Needless to mention that rest of the directions given by the High Court remain unaltered.
Appeal disposed of
