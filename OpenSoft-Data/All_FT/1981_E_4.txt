1. It is stated by the counsel for the respondents that respondent No. 1 is dead. According to the prosecution, respondent No. 1 is the main accused and the second respondent was merely an abettor. Both were acquitted by the High Court. Hence this appeal to this Court.
Since the appeal abates against the first respondent on account of his death and the second respondent has already been acquitted, appeal against the second respondent becomes infructuous. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
