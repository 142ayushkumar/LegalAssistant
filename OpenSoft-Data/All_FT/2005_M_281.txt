Om Construction Builders and Developers v Mira Bhayandar Municipal Council and others
Supreme Court of India

17 January 2005
Contempt Petition (C) No. 1 of 2001 in C.A. No. 3604 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The report submitted by the Principal Judge, City Civil Court, appears to support the alleged contemnor's case that there was in fact no contempt.
2. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicant, however, disputes the correctness of the report. In view of the dispute which has arisen between the parties it is not appropriate for the Court to take proceedings in contempt.
3.  The proceedings in contempt are accordingly dropped. It is made clear that the report having been given for the purpose of the contempt proceedings shall not be binding as such on the merits of the main dispute between the parties.
Order accordingly.
