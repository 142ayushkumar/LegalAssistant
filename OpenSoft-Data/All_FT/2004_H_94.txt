Haryana Urban Development Authority v Virender Sharma
Supreme Court of India

9 February 2004
C.A. No. 874 of 2004 (Along with C.A. No. 875-876 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In these appeals the respondents who were working on the establishment of the appellant filed a claim statement not only for reinstatement in service but also for certain back wages and a reference was made to the Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court-1. The Labour Court granted both the reliefs in each of these cases and the matter was carried to the High Court. The High Court having dismissed the writ petition, these appeals are filed by special leave. We have examined the matter in detail and found that although for short period the respondents have worked, 50% back wages have been granted, which we find too high.
2.   In the circumstances we think the same should be reduced to 25%. In other respects the order made by the Labour Court as affirmed by the High Court shall not be disturbed. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
