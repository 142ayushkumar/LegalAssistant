Limbraj and Another v Regional Officer, M.I.D.C., Maharashtra and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2009
Civil Appeal No. 6270 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the Bombay High Court [Aurangabad Bench] dated 14th November, 2000 in First Appeal No.106 of 2000.
2.  Since the facts have been given in detail in the impugned judgment of the High Court, it is not necessary to refer to the same here.
3.  Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned counsel for the appellants, has, inter alia, submitted that the potentiality of the land has not been considered while fixing the compensation there for.
4.  We have carefully perused the judgment of the High Court and find that this argument qua potentiality is correct. The High Court, in the impugned judgment, has not considered the potentiality of the land. Hence, we set aside the impugned judgment and remand the matter to the Bombay High Court for a fresh decision after hearing the parties in accordance with law.
The civil appeal is, accordingly, allowed.
Appeal allowed
