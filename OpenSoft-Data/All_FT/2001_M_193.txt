Mange Ram and Anr v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

9 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2904/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Considering the facts of the case and on the peculiar situation including the fact that the High Court had chosen to suspend the sentence of three co-accused, we are inclined to suspend the sentence in respect of these two appellants also who were arrayed as A4 and A8 respectively in the trial court. Thus the sentence will remain suspended during the pendency of the appeal before the High Court.
2. We, therefore, order them to be released on bail on executing a bond before the trial court for such sum as the trial judge may fix with two solvent sureties to his satisfaction.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
