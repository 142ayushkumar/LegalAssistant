Supreme Court of India

3 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2811/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard Mr. Rajiv Dutta, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner and Ms. Sandhya Goswami appearing for the respondent No.5-State of Rajasthan.
2. The main thrust of the arguments of Mr.Rajiv Dutta is against the direction issued by the Special Judge SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities Act) Court, Churu to the effect
"For lodging the false report by complainant-Sant Lal and according to the remarks given in the judgment, a copy of this judgment be sent to Branch Manager, Marudhar Regional Gramin Bank, Doongargarh Branch."
3.  Mr. Dutta contends that in view of this observation, the service of the petitioner, in the Bank is likely to be adversely affected. He further submits that since the accused persons have been acquitted by the Special Judge in the judgment which has been onfirmed by the High Court the direction quoted above may be deleted from the judgment of the Special Judge.Considering the submissions of Shri Dutta, we are of the view that the direction of the trial court, quoted above, was not necessary for disposal of the case on merit. We, therefore, order its deletion from the judgment. Rest of the judgment of the trial court as confirmed by the High Court will remain unaltered. The SLP is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
