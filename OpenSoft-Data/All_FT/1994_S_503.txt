Parasuram Patel and Another v State of Orissa
Supreme Court of India

14 January 1994
The Judgment was delivered by : P. B. Sawant, J.
Special leave granted.
1. In the present case, the High Court dismissed the criminal appeal of the appellants only on the ground that there was default in appearance of the appellants and their counsel. It is now well settled that no can be dismissed on the ground of default in appearance. The court has to go through the record of the case even in the absence of the appellants or their counsel and decide the matter on merit. Inasmuch as the High Court dismissed the appeal without going into the merit of the matter, the impugned order dated 7-4-1992 is hereby set aside and the matter is remanded to the High Court for decision on merit. In the circumstances of the case, the High Court should dispose of the matter within two months of the receipt of this order.
The appeal is allowed accordingly
