Dinesh Kumar v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

9  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.)......./2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After going through the allegations contained in the complaint on the basis of which the F.I.R. has been registered, we feel that it is unnecessary to issue notice to the State of Bihar. The High Court has now directed the petitioner to surrender before the court concerned and apply for bail.
2. If the petitioner surrenders within two weeks from today and applies for bail the court concerned shall release him on bail on executing a bond for such amount as the court deems necessary with two solvent sureties and it is open to the court concerned to impose such conditions as it deems necessary.
With these observations this Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
