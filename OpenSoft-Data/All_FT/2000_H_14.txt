Habeeb Mohammed and Others v Syed Khaja Qutubuddin
Supreme Court of India

20 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4326/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1. The prayer of the respondents in the petition sought to restrain Respondents 16 to 22 thereto "from attending any of the Executive Committee or General Body Meetings of the Madina Educational Society, Mahbubnagar whenever they are convened, pending disposal of the main O.P."
2.  As the High Court noted in its order under challenge, it had been conceded before the Trial Judge that the appellants had no objection whatsoever to the respondents continuing as members of the society pending the disposal of the main petition but, that they should be restrained from taking part in the Executive Committee Meetings. The operative portion of the order of the Trial Judge also suggests that he intended to restrain the respondents only from taking part in the Executive Committee Meetings, but he overlooked the prayer that included General Body Meetings. This appears to have happened also in the High Court.
3.  We think, therefore, that it is appropriate that the relief that has been granted is modified so that original Respondents 16 to 22 are restrained from attending the Executive Committee Meetings of the Madina Educational Society, Mahbubnagar, Andhra Pradesh.
4. The civil appeal is allowed to this extent. Liberty to the parties to move the Trial Judge for expeditious disposal.No order as to costs.
Appeal partly allowed.
