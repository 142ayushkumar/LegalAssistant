Supreme Court of India

3 November 2008
CIVIL APPEAL NO.6442 OF 2008 (ARISING OUT OF SLP(C) NO.785 OF 2008)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not find any merit in this appeal save and except that the multiplier of 11 adopted by the High Court in its judgment impugned before us, was on higher side and, in our view, the multiplier of 8 will be just and reasonable.  Therefore, the amount of compensation shall be paid to the claimants by applying multiplier of 8 instead of 11 as adopted by the High Court. The order of the High Court is modified to the extent indicated above. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
