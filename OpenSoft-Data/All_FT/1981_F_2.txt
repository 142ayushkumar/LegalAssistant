Special leave granted.
1.  After carefully perusing the record, we find that the offence disclosed against the appellants is one u/s. 324 read with S. 325 of the Indian Penal Code. These offences are compoundable with the permission of the court. The parties have made a request that they should be allowed to compound the case and they have also filed a composition deed in the High Court.
2. In view of this, the permission to compound the offence is granted and in consequence the appeal is allowed and the appellants are acquitted of the charges levelled against them.
Appeal allowed
