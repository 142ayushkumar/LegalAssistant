Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10948/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere in the matter. The special leave petition is dismissed.
2.  Learned counsel for the petitioners then stated that in case the petitioners are required to vacate the premises in question immediately, they shall be put to great hardship and for that reason the petitioners may be granted some time to vacate the premises. The request appears to be reasonable.
