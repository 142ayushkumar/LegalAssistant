Crane Owners Association and Others v State of Gujarat and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
C.A..No.659-661/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Mr.FS Nariman submits that the tax demanded from persons other than an individual is quite exhorbitant and there is discrimination in the classification and prays for stay of the impugned notification. The learned Solicitor General submits that so far as the current year is concerned the tax has been paid by the concerned 2 parties at the stage of renewal of the licences, which is however disputed by the learned counsel for the appellants. Be that as it may, the order we propose to pass is as follows:-
2. The members of the Crane Owners Association, the appellant no.1, shall pay 1/2 of the tax in demand and give surety for the balance amount to the satisfaction of the Comissioner - Transport, Taxation Authority, individually at the time of renewal in future.
3.  Such of the members who have already paid tax will not be entitled to refund but they can avail the benefit of this order for the future period. There shall be a direction as stated above. Liberty to mention.
Order accordingly.
