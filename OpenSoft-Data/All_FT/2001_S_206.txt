Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.1510/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Inasmuch as the original authority and the first appellate authority have not merely proceeded on the lack of authority of the Secretary to pursue the legal claim but they have decided the matter on merits.
2. Even though the High Court has said that the appellant did not have the authority to pursue with the matter, it is unnecessry for us to interfere with the order in this proceeding as the dispute has been decided therein on merits. The Special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
