Neon Laboratories Limited v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

1 April 2009
C.A. No. 2250 of 2009
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Writ Petition No. 2222 of 1999 dated 23-3-2006.
2.  The appellant M/s. Neon Laboratories, submitted their claims for credit under Passbook Scheme of Export Import Policy, 1992-97 for the Shipping Bills (1) 730272 dt. 11-3-96, (2) 804444 dt. 23-8-96, (3) 804451 dt. 23-8-96, (4) 730255 dt. 11-3-96, (5) 837182 dt. 5-11-96 and (6) 724928 dt. 27-2-96 along with other relevant documents. On examination of the documents, the Designated Authority rejected the claim of the appellant on the ground that the goods were manufactured under loan licence and the same was not covered under the category of manufacture exporter and the benefit of the Scheme were available only for manufacturer exporter.
3.  The appellant aggrieved by the said order preferred a Writ Petition before the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. The Division Bench also did not find merit in the Writ Petition filed by the appellant.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
4.  We are not clear whether the appellant is entitled for the benefit under the Scheme because all documents are not before this Court. The record of the case of Designated Authority is also not before us. Even the counter affidavit filed before the High Court has not been placed on record. In the interest of justice, we deem it appropriate to set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and the order passed by the Designated Authority of Passbook Scheme dated 12-5-1999. We order accordingly. We direct the concerned Authority to decide this case de novo after hearing learned counsel for the parties without being influenced by the observations of the courts below.
5.  Since the matter has been pending for quite some time, we request the concerned Authority to decide the matter as expeditiously as possible in any event within six months from the date of communication of this order. All issues are left open.
6. This appeal is, accordingly, disposed of leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
Appeal disposed of.
