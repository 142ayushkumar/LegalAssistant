Collector of Central Excise, Madras v Coimbatore Pioneer Fertilizers Limited
Supreme Court of India

24 July 1997
C.As. Nos. 10013-15 of 1983
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The only question for decision in these appeals is whether pulverisation of rock phosphate amounts to a process of manufacture so as to make it exigible to duty in terms of Entry No. 14-HH of the Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944. The Tribunal has held that it is not a process of manufacture and, therefore, no duty is leviable. The Department has come up in appeal against the Tribunal's decision.
2.  Learned counsel for the appellant referred to another decision of the Tribunal reported in Pyrites Phosphates and Chemicals Ltd. v. CCE 1983 Indlaw CEGAT 106 taking the opposite view. In support of the view taken in Pyrites Phosphates 1983 Indlaw CEGAT 106  reliance was placed by the Tribunal on the decision of the Delhi High Court in Hyderabad Asbestos Cement Products Ltd. v. Union of India 1980 Indlaw DEL 69 which decision of the Delhi High Court has been reversed by this Court in Hyderabad Industries Ltd. v. Union of India. 1995 Indlaw SC 4691995 Indlaw SC 469. The view taken by the Tribunal in Pyrites Phosphates' is, therefore, untenable.
3.  We find no ground to differ from the view taken by the Tribunal in the present case.
The appeals are, therefore, dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
