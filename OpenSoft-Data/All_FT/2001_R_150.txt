Ram Avtar v Rajender Kumar Aggarwal and Anr
Supreme Court of India

16 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2292/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere with the order by which the High Court declined to cancel the bail granted to the respondents. However, learned counsel expressed apprehension that some of the observations made in the impugned order may cause trouble to the petitioner.
2.  We make a note that those observations are only for the purpose of disposing of the application for granting/cancellation of bail.
3. They would not stand in the way of the petitioner proving the real nature of the transaction during the trial or thereafter.
With these observations these Special Leave Petitions are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
