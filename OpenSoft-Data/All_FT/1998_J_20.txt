United India Insurance Company v Jagdish Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 July 1998
C.A. No. 9130 of 1996, Dt. 22 July 1998.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court refusing to grant stay while the appeal filed by the insurer is pending before it. The Motor Vehicles Claims Tribunal has awarded compensation and the insurer has filed the appeal contending that the insurer will not be liable at all. It is not necessary for us to go into the merits of the said contention which will be decided in the pending appeal, but the question that arises for consideration is whether at this stage while the appeal is pending, the insurer would be called upon to pay the entire amount awarded or a part of it. Admittedly, under the statute, a sum of Rs.25,000/- is payable for no fault liability. There is no justification for the insurer not paying the said amount.
2. In view of the stand taken by the insurer in the pending appeal to the effect that the insurer will not be liable at all and taking the statutory provisions into consideration, we modify the impugned interim order of the High Court and direct that the appellant shall pay to the claimants a sum of Rs.25,000/- within four weeks from today and on such payment being made the balance amount would remain stayed till the disposal of the appeal by the High Court. We make it clear that if this amount of Rs.25,000/- is not paid within four weeks from today, the order of stay shall stand vacated. This appeal is allowed accordingly with no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
