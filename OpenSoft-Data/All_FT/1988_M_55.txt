State of Jammu and Kashmir and Others v Messrs Sudhir and Company Jammu and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 January 1988
C.A. No. 3405 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against an order passed in the course of contempt proceedings initiated against the officers of the appellant-State on the ground of alleged violation of an interim order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court in CMP No. 892 of 1987 on August 12, 1987. The interim order in question has been subjected to an LPA appeal to the Division Bench of the same High Court. The Division Bench has passed an interim order in the course of the said LPA appeal. It is not disputed that the appellants are bound to abide by the said interim order passed by the Division Bench in CMP (LPA Writ) Nos. 1903 and 1749 of 1987 Dated November 3, 1987 and will do so.
2.   So far as the contempt proceedings arising out of the alleged contempt in the context of the earlier interim order passed by the learned Single Judge are concerned in the circumstances of the case we think that ends of justice would be served if the said contempt proceedings are stayed till the final disposal of the LPA appeals pending before the Division Bench. We direct accordingly. The present appeal stands disposed of in these terms with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
