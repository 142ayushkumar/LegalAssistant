Collector of Customs, Bombay v Ramajain Hosiery
Supreme Court of India

12 October 1995
C.A. No. 327 of 1991
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned Counsel submits that a last opportunity should be given to the appellant by allowing him to serve the Chamber Summons which has been taken out on 7th October 1995, that is to say, about two months after the Office Report on default which is before us.
2. The Office Report indicates that the appellant has taken no action despite letters dated 30th June, 1992 and 11th February, 1993 and even after a default notice dated 25th November, 1993.
3.  Those who approach this Court should be diligent. Taking out a fresh Chamber Summons two years after the default notice is not diligence.
4.  Counsel states that the appellant had been ascertaining whether service had been effected. If the appellant requires three years time to ascertain whether service has been effected, something is clearly very wrong.
The Civil Appeal is dismissed for default.
Appeal dismissed.
