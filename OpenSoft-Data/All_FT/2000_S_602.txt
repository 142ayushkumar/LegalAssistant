Abdul Hamit Ansari and Others v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

16 March 2000
Cr.A. No. 295 of 2000 (arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 3923 of 1999), Dt. 16 March 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We know that this is a case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 149. Though the police was not able to trace out the culprits at the first stage of the investigation, pursuant to the petition filed by the widow of the deceased further investigation was conducted and the names of the present appellants are also now included among the suspected persons. We came across the antecedents of the deceased which appellants described as 'dreaded'. Nontheless, we are not inclined to give a pre-arrest bail order to the appellants. At the same time considering all the pros and cons of this matter we are of the view that some relief must be granted to the appellants in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. We, therefore, dispose of this appeal with the following directions:
(1) If appellants would surrender before the police within 2 weeks from today, we direct the Investigating Officer to complete the interrogation of the appellant concerned as expeditiously as possible. On completion of interrogation and recovery of material object, if any, such appellant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond in a sum of Rs. 5, 000/- with two solvent sureties each to the satisfaction of the Investigating Officer.
2.  Appellants shall abide by the condition, inter alia, that no threat shall be exerted on any of the witnesses nor any evidence be tampered with. We also make it clear that if any of the appellants misuses the bail we permit the Investigating Officer or even the aggrieved person to move the Sessions Court or the High Court under section 439(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for cancellation of the bail. With these observations, this appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
