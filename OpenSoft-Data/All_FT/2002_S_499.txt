P.(C) Nos. 672 of 2000, 419 of 2001 and S. L. P.(C) No. 4129 of 1992
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. A Bench of five learned Judges has referred to a Bench of seven learned Judges these matters for the reason that it was of the opinion that the view expressed in the case of Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company vs. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. & Anr. (1983 (1) SCC 147 1982 Indlaw SC 134) required consideration.
2. Put shortly, the question is as to the interpretation of Art. 39(b) of the Constitution which speaks of the distribution for the public good of the ownership and control of the material resources of the community. In State of Karnataka vs. Ranganatha Reddy & Anr. (1978 (1) SCR 641 1977 Indlaw SC 247), two judgments were delivered. In the judgment delivered by Krishna Iyer, J., speaking for  himself and two other judges, the view was taken that material resources of the community covered all resources, natural and man-made, publicly and privately owned. The other judgment, delivered by Untwalia, J., on behalf of himself and three other Judges, did not consider it necessary to express any opinion with regard to Art. 39(b); it was, however, made clear in this, the majority judgment that the learned Judges did not subscribe to the view taken in respect of Art. 39 (b) by Krishna Iyer, J. The view taken by Krishna Iyer, J. in the case of Ranganatha Reddy was affirmed by a Constitution Bench in the case of Sanjeev Coke (aforementioned).
3. Now, in the course of the argument before us, the learned Solicitor General, appearing for the Union of India and the State of Maharashtra, has drawn our attention to the judgment of a Bench of nine learned Judges in the case of Mafatlal Industries Ltd. vs. Union of India (1997 (5) SCC 536 1996 Indlaw SC 4128). Speaking for himself and four other Judges, Jeevan Reddy, J. said, "That the material resources of the community are not confined to public resources but include all resources, natural and man-made, public and private owned is repeatedly affirmed by this Court.", and reference was made to the cases of Ranganatha Reddy, Sanjeev Coke and  State of Tamil Nadu vs L.Abu Kavur Bai & Ors. (1984 (1) SCC 515 1983 Indlaw SC 240).
4. Having given due consideration, we are of the opinion that this interpretation of Art. 39(b) requires to be reconsidered by a Bench of nine learned Judges: we have some difficulty in sharing the broad view that material resources of the community under Art. 39(b) covers what is privately owned. Given that there is some similarity in the issues here involved and in the case of I.R.Coelho vs. State of Tamil Nadu (1999 (7) SCC 580 1999 Indlaw SC 701) which already stands referred to a larger Bench, preferably of nine learned Judges, we are of the view that these matters should be heard by a Bench of nine learned Judges immediately following the hearing in the case of I.R.Coelho. Given the importance of the matter and the fact that constitutional issues are involved in I.R.Coelho as also in this case, we direct that parties shall file skeleton arguments within eight weeks.
5. The papers shall be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate directions.
Order accordingly
