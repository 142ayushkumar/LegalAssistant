State of Gujarat v Krupaben B. Trivedi and Anr
Supreme Court of India

16 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.1456/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere with the interim order made in Civil Application No.8129/2000 in Letters Patent Appeal No.538/2000, dated 16.10.2000, since the Letters Patent Appeal is pending in the High Court. The special leave petition is, therefore, dismissed.
2.  Keeping in view the nature of controversy in the case, it would be appropriate that the Letters Patent Appeal be heard and disposed of expeditiously.
3. We request the learned Chief Justice of the High Court of Gujarat to have the Letters Patent Appeal 538/2000 disposed of at an early date and as far as possible within six months.
Petition dismissed.
