Telemecanique and Controls (India) Limited v Messrs Schneider Electric Industries
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20398/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having heard Mr. F.S. Nariman, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, we are not inclined to interfere with the order under challenge.
2. However, having regard to the nature of the goods involved and the fact that the order of injunction is operating against the petitioner, we consider it just and proper that the suit be disposed of expeditiously, preferably within a period of six months from today. For expeditious disposal of the suit we request the learned Chief Justice of the High Court to allot the suit to a learned Judge for taking up the case on day to day basis to complete the trial and dispose it of within the aforesaid period.
The special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
