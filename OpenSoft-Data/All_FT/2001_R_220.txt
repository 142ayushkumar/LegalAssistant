Naresh Chintaman Athavale v Ramesh J. Doshi
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6613/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In the order under challenge, the learned Single Judge has proceeded upon the basis that an order passed by the High Court on 21st November, 1988 was upheld by this court.
2. It appears to us that this is not quite correct. It, therefore, becomes necessary to set aside the order under challenge and restore the civil revision application (No.41 of 1989) to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits.
This shall be done expeditiously.
3.  We express no opinion on the merits of the case on either side.
Order on the appeal accordingly. No order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
