Roshmoni Devi v State of West Bengal and Anr
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2054/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  It is stated to us by the counsel appearing for the petitioner that the petitioner has already surrendered and is in custody. The petitioner has been convicted under section 20 (b)(i) of the  NDPS Act and has been sentenced to imprisonment for a period of three years and fine of Rs.50, 000/-.
2.  Against the said conviction and sentence, an appeal has been preferred before the Calcutta High Court and it is pending. The only prayer the petitioner makes in this Court is that there should be a direction to the High Court to dispose of the said appeal early so that it would not become infructuous inasmuch as the sentence is only for three years.
3.  Having regard to the sentence involved, we request the Calcutta High court to take up the criminal appeal and dispose it of at an early date so that the appeal will not be rendered infructous. This order of ours may not be construed to be an order on merits of the matter as we have not examined the matter on merits.
The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
