Savitri Devi v Ramesh Chand and Others
Supreme Court of India

28 November 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal(Cr.).../2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
Delay condoned.
1.  We do not see any merit in the challenge made to the order of the High Court in Criminal Revision No.462 of 2002, on the facts of the case. The special leave petition is, therefore, dismissed.
2.  At the same time, we express our disapproval of some of the generalized views expressed in the judgment of the High Court by the learned Single Judge.
The learned Judge ought to have seen that such observations, though may be appropriate for seminars or workshops, should have been avoided being incorporated as part of a court judgment. Some of the views also touch upon Legislative measures and wisdom of legislative policy in substance, which according to the learned Judge need to be taken into account. There was no scope for considering all such matters in the case which was before the learned Judge.
3. It is, therefore, appropriate that such generalized observations or views should meticulously avoided by Courts in the judgments.
Order Accordingly.
