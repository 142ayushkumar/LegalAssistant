The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Heard learned counsel for the appellant and read the judgment under appeal. While we sympathise with what the assessee is doing, we do not think that its activity can be said to provide "credit facilities" to its members.
2. Therefore, the High Court has rightly held that the provisions of s. 80P of the IT Act, 1961 are not applicable. The appeals dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeals Dismissed.
