State of Rajasthan v Shankar Lal Kunda Ram Banwarilal
Supreme Court of India

9 October 1991
C.A. Nos. 1092, 1091, 1093 of 1990 with C.A. Nos. 2671-72 of 1989, S.L.P. Nos. 10952-53 of 1989
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted in fresh matters.
1.  In the State of Rajasthan, the government introduced a special scheme known by three separate names for providing employment to at least one member of every landless family not already provided work to make provision of work for 100 days in a year and the scheme conceived of the arrangement that after 100 days of employment was over, someone else similarly situated would be provided employment so that the scheme would be running and available to provide employment to as many unemployed people in the State as it could cover.
2.  We are of the view that the scheme has a philosophy behind it and the basic aspect is that those who have no employment at all would have provision of employment for at least 100 days and the basic 100 days employment would provide them sustenance for the remaining period during which they have no employment. Good of the greatest number seems to be the basic aspect which has been lost sight of by the High Court. We vacate the decision of the High Court and restore the scheme to operate. The respondents would not be entitled to any other relief excepting the benefit envisaged in the scheme of employment for 100 days in a year.
The appeals are allowed. There will be no order for costs.
Appeal allowed.
