Vikas Agarwal and another v State of Uttar Pradesh and others
Supreme Court of India

23 February 2005
C.A. No. 6528 of 2004
The Judgment was delivered by: B.P. SINGH, J.
1.  In this Appeal by Special Leave the order of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, Lucknow dated 27th February, 2004 passed in Writ Petition No. 846 (M.B.) of 2004 has been impugned. By the aforesaid order the High Court refused to grant interim relief but directed early hearing of the Writ Petition.
We are informed by Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants that the Appeal is likely to be heard next week and is expected to be disposed of within reasonable time. In this view of the matter, we consider it unnecessary to keep this Appeal pending before this Court.
2.  Since the Writ Petition is about to be heard, we direct that no third party interest shall be created, if not already created. In case there is inordinate delay in disposal of the Writ Petition, it will be open to the respondents to seek such directions from the High Court as they may be advised, including permission to grant mining permits under the relevant rules.
This appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
