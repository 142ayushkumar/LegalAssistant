State of Maharashtra and others v Pradeep
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2003
C.A. No. 2776 of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 21142 of 2002)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Having regard to the summary dismissal of the writ petition by the High Court, even while issuing notice on 21.11.2002 this Court directed intimation to be given also as to why the order of the High Court should not be set aside and the matter remitted to the High Court for consideration afresh on merits. Interim stay, in the meanwhile, was also granted. The respondents have since entered appearance.
2.  It is contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that the order passed by the High Court was by way of affirming the order of the tribunal and, therefore, absence of reasons by the High Court does not matter. We are unable to agree with the learned counsel for the respondent. Even if it be by way of affirmation of the order of the tribunal below, being an order passed by the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, there must be sufficient indication of application of mind to the grievance made in the writ petition challenging the orders of the tribunal. We find such a thing to be lacking in this case.
3. Consequently, we allow this appeal, set aside the order of the High Court on this only ground and direct the matter to be restored to its original file to be dealt with afresh on merits and in accordance with law after hearing both the parties. The High Court may consider the disposal of the matter expeditiously, preferable within a period of six months from the date of receipt of copy of this order. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
