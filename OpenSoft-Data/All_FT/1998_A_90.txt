Secretary/President, Anandilal Ganesh Podar Society v Ashok Bhimani and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 August 1998
C.A. No. 4010 of 1998 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (C) No. 10399 of 1998)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties finally.
1.  In our view, the interim order passed by the High Court deserves to be modified in terms of the ad interim order passed by this Court on 29-6-1998, meaning thereby that without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in the pending writ petition in the High Court, the appellant shall be entitled to charge the fees which were being charged during the academic year 1997-98 only and that will enure for this academic year subject to the result in the writ petition. It is clarified that this order will also apply to the fees to be charged from students in the pre-primary section which will be on the basis of the fees charged last year.
2. We request the High Court to make it convenient to decide the writ petition as early as possible preferably before 31-12-1998. It is obvious that it is open to the High Court to pass appropriate final orders in the writ petition when it comes to be finally disposed of. It is also clarified that the charges of parent enrichment fees of Rs. 250/- collected twice a year is purely voluntary in nature and not compulsory as fairly submitted by learned senior counsel for the appellant. He states that whoever wants to pay these fees voluntarily, willbe permitted to pay.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No. costs.
Appeal disposed of.
