1.  These special leave petitions are made respecting the judgments in L.P.A. Nos. 1187 of 1981 and 1207 of 1981 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The petitioners were owners of certain lands of Burail and Maloya village on the outskirts of Chandigarh which had been acquired for public purpose pursuant to notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short 'the Act') published in the local Gazette dated February 1, 1977.
2.   The Land Acquisition Collector by his award under Section 11 of the Act determined the market value of the said lands at Rs. 16,000 an acre. The District Judge at Chandigarh who had received the reference under Section 18 of the Act enhanced the market value of the acquired lands to Rs. 34,000 and acre.
3.  The High Court before which appeals had been brought by the claimants seeking grant of enhanced the market value for their lands, enhanced the market value to Rs. 62,000 an acre following its earlier judgment in similar appeal being L.P.A. No. 1207 of 1981. On behalf of the petitioners, in the present petitions, we were not shown any material on the basis of which the High Court could have determined the market value of the acquired lands at a rate in excess of Rs. 62,000 an acre. Hence, we see no ground to interfere with the judgments of the High Court and enhance the market value of the acquired lands.
We, therefore, dismiss these special leave petitions, however without costs.
Petitions dimissed.
