State of Punjab and Anr v Jagrup Singh Gill
Supreme Court of India

26 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13701/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In our view the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court in LPA No.735/2001 does not call for any interference, hence this petition is dismissed.
2. However, in the meantime, time to pay the retirement benefits to the respondent is extended upto 31-3-2002. In case of failure to pay the same, the petitioner will be liable to pay interest on the said amount, at the rate of 10% p.a. as ordered by the learned Single Judge.
Petition dismissed.
