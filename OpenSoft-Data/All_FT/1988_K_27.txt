Kamla Rajkumar Rajani v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 January 1988
Criminal W.P. No. 748 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  At the stage of admission, Shri Naresh Mathur, learned counsel for the petitioner confined his submission to only one point, namely, there was failure on the part of the Central Government to consider the representation made by the detenu against the order of detention passed by the State Government of Uttar Pradesh under Section 3 (1) of Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 and hence his continued detention was invalid. In response to the notice, a counter-affidavit has been filed by R.S.Asthenia, Joint Secretary to the State Government through the Superintendent, Central Jail, Naini was received by the Central Jail, Naini was received by the State Government on May 15, 1987, and that the State Government considered and rejected the same on May 21, 1987 and that there was communication of the rejection of both the representations to the detenu.
2.   In view of this averment, learned counsel for the petitioner abandoned the ground earlier raised and sought to assail the detention order on various other grounds. We have heard him at length and despite his persuasiveness and lucidity of arguments, find no substance in any of the grounds and therefore we did not call upon the respondents to reply
The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
