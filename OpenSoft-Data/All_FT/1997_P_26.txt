Palam Vihar Residents Association (Regd.) Through Capt. P. Goswami v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 March 1997
S.L.P. (C) No. 11023 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and hearing Mr. Harish N. Salve, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Palam Vihar Residents Association and Dr. Singhvi, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the State of Haryana, it appears to us that the area in question being highly developed and quite close to the National Capital of Delhi, special care is required to be taken to ensure that unauthorised encroachment and unauthorised constructions are not made in the area.
2. In our view, it will be only appropriate if the Government of Haryana forms a Monitoring Cell with a Gazetted Officer from the Government of Haryana Police Service, a Gazetted Officer from the Haryana Civil Service and also a Gazetted Officer from the Office of District Town Planner Enforcement, Gurgaon. We direct accordingly. Such cell will ensure against unauthorised construction and unauthorised encroachment of the area in question and will monitor each complaint of unauthorised construction and encroachment and progress of pending cases in connection with encroachment and construction and will take appropriate steps required to be taken for the purpose of removing such unauthorised construction and unauthorised encroachment.
3. It also appears to us that it will be only appropriate if Hon'ble the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court constitutes a Special Bench of the said High Court where the Monitoring Cell will report back to such Bench the developments in the matter and the action taken in removing the unauthorised encroachment and construction every six months so that appropriate direction as may be required, may be given by the High Court.
4. The special leave petition is accordingly disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
