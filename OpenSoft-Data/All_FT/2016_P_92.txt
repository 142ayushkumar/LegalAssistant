Punjab State Electricity Board v Powergrid Corporation of India and others
Supreme Court of India

24 February 2016
Civil Appeal No. 5133 of 2006 With Civil Appeal No. 256 of 2007
(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. Despite the very persuasive submissions advanced by Mr. Pradeep Mishra, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, we find it difficult to appreciate the submissions.
2. What has been done by the respondents is only to correct an obvious error that has crept in while applying the norms in the matter of depreciation on equities.
3. That there is no depreciation on equity, cannot be disputed. In the subsequent years, it is seen that the mistake has been corrected also.
4. In that view of the matter, we do not find any merit in these appeals which are, accordingly, dismissed.
5. No costs.
Appeals dismissed
