Madanlal Gangaram Ghai v State of Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

8 February 1979
Cr.A. No. 119 of 1975
The Judgment was delivered by: FAZAL ALI, J.
1.  This appeal by Special Leave is limited to the question of sentence. It appears that the appellant has been convicted u/s. 5(1)(d) read with S. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and was sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 500/- as reduced by the High Court. The appellant has already undergone about 2 1/2 months in jail. In the peculiar circumstances of this case and having regard to the nature of the offence committed by the appellant in this particular case we do not think it necessary to send the appellant back to jail. We therefore, while upholding the conviction of the appellant reduce the sentence of imprisonment to the period already served and remit the fine. The appellant will now be discharged from his bail bonds. With this modification the appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
