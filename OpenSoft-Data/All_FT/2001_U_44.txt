U.P. Jal Nigam v Santosh and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6039/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court is justified in converting the writ petition into an application treating it as one made in the first appeal and while granting time for deposit of 80% of the compensation awarded to the parties, directed that such deposit should be made by the next day which on the face of it is impossible of performance.
2.  In the circumstances we think it would be appropriate for the High Court to consider extension of time for deposit of the amount.
3. Therefore, we think this is not a fit case for our interference. With these observations, the special leave petition shall stand disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
