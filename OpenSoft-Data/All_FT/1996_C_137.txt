Ilavia Enterprises v Collector of Central Excise, Jaipur
Supreme Court of India

25 October 1996
C.A. No. 9786 of 1996, [Arising as an appeal against 1997 (90) E.L.T. 542 (Tribunal).]
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The notice on the appeal was limited to the question of limitation.
2.  The appellants manufacture 'shikakai' bath powder. Their contention that it was an Ayurvedic medicine was turned down in the order of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal under appeal and it was held that the bath powder was a cosmetic. The appellants had commenced manufacture of the bath powder on 1st August, 1991 and had made the requisite declaration in April, 1992. On 10th May, 1993 they were issued with a notice of demand claiming duty on the bath powder as a cosmetic for the period 1st August, 1991 to 30th December, 1992. The Collector held that the assessee had suppressed facts; therefore, duty could be levied for a period larger than six months. The Tribunal was not satisfied that the failure to declare was bona fide and the extended period, therefore, had been correctly applied.
3.  We do not think that what has been stated by the Collector or the Tribunal makes out a case of suppression that entitles the authorities to apply the extended period. The material or record does not lead us to the conclusion that the appellants had acted with any mala fide intention. Therefore, the demand must be restricted to the period of six months preceding its date, that is to say, for the period of six months immediately preceding 10th May, 1993.
4.  The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
