State of Uttarakhand and others v Suman Pal
Supreme Court of India

4 January 2016
Civil Appeal No. 5 of 2016 (Arising Out of S. L. P. (C) No. 34192 of 2014)
(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Anil R. Dave, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. Heard the learned counsel and perused the record.
3. Upon perusal of the record, we find that reinstatement with 50% backwages would not be just. Therefore, we modify the impugned judgment to the effect that a lump-sum amount of Rs.2 lakhs (Rupees two lakhs only) be paid to the respondent, a daily wager, as he was not regularly appointed and he was relieved before several years.
4. The afore-stated amount of Rs.2 lakhs shall be paid within three months from today and the respondent shall not have any further right.
4. The impugned order is set aside and the appeal is disposed of as partly allowed. Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.
Appeal partly allowed
