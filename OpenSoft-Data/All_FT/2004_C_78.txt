Chief Administrator, H.U.D.A. and Another v Jugal Kishore Kohli
Supreme Court of India

24 August 2004
C.A. No. 8398 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  This Appeal is against an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi dated 28th February, 2004. The complaint was filed directly before the National Commission. Instead of looking into the complaint and seeing whether any case for award has been made out, the complaint has been made out, the complaint has been disposed off by merely stating that there was no reason to take a different view than that taken in HUDA vs. Darsh Kumar 1986-2002 CONSUMER 5722 (NS) :  (NS). On that basis the National Commission has disposed of the complaint by directing payment of interest at the rate of 18% p.a.
2.  In our view, the order of the National Commission is unsustainable. The Commission must deal with each case on its merit. If on facts of a case the National Commission feels that award of compensation is justified it must award compensation under an appropriate head.
3. The National Commission must follow the principles laid down in our judgment in Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in 1986-2004 CONSUMER 8287 (NS)2004 Indlaw SC 941 (NS)  2004 Indlaw SC 941.
4.  We accordingly set aside the order of the National Commission and remit the matter back to the National Commission for disposal on merits.
5.  We clarify that the dismissal of Special Leave Petition of the Respondent, on the ground of delay, by this Court, should not preclude National Commission from deciding this case on its merit.
The Appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
