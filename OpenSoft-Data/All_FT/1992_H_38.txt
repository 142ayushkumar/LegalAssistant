Hukam Singh (Dead) By LRS. and Others v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 September 1992
C.As. Nos. 1980-82 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Nobody appears for the appellants. We have heard Shri N.N. Goswami, the learned counsel for the State of Haryana. In these appeals, the appellants have challenged the proceedings for acquisition of land under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 as a colourable exercise of power on the ground that the acquisition was for the purpose of a company, viz., Respondent 4, without complying with the provisions of Part VII of the Land Acquisition Act.
2. The impugned notifications have been upheld by the High Court and reliance has been placed on the decision of this Court in Somavanti v. State of Punjab 1962 Indlaw SC 4051962 Indlaw SC 405, where the acquisition was for the purpose of a public company which had to start a factory and the State had contributed an amount of Rs 100 towards the total price of land which was worth Rs 4,50,000.
3.  Shri Goswami points out that in the present case, the entire amount of compensation is paid from the State funds but the land is handed over for development of a company and that it is permissible. He has placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Manubhai Jethalal Patel v. State of Gujarat  1983 Indlaw SC 324 , wherein the contribution by the State was only Re 1 and the said acquisition was upheld by this Court.
4.   In the aforesaid circumstances, we find no merit in these appeals and the appeals are accordingly dismissed. No orders as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
