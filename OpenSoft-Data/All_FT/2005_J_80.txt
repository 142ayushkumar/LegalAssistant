State of Chhattisgarh and another v Jyoti Siddhu
Supreme Court of India

15 February 2005
C.A. No. 345 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal has been preferred by the State of Chhattisgarh against the order of the High Court of Chhattisgarh awarding compensation in a sum of Rs. 2,00,000 (Rupees two lakhs) with 9 per cent interest per annum (per month wrongly mentioned in the impugned order) for death in riots in the year 1984.
2.  It has been reported to us that similar relief, by grant of compensation for death in the riots, was granted to one other claimant and the civil appeal against the same was also filed by the State being Civil Appeal No. 344 of 2004, but it has been withdrawn by the State and disposed of as such on 10-12-2004, by a Bench of this Court.
3. In the circumstances, learned counsel seeks time to take specific instructions from the State to withdraw this appeal. As the State has withdrawn similar appeal against grant of compensation to a riot victim in that case, only because in the present case there is no first information report available, the compensation to the present respondent cannot be denied, when the claim has been found to be based on the death during the riots of 1984. We, therefore, decline to interfere in this appeal.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
