Lalita v Kulwinder Kumar
Supreme Court of India

31 January 2005
Transfer Petition (C) No. 704 of 2004 with TP (Cr.) No. 276 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These are wife's petitions for transfer of divorce petition being Suit No. 601 of 2003 titled Kulwinder Kumar v. Lalita pending in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Ghaziabad (U.P.) to the Court of the District Judge, Ludhiana (Punjab) and criminal proceedings being Complaint No. 459 of 2003 titled Kulwinder Kumar v. Hari Kishan Lal and Lalita pending in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Karkardooma Courts, Shahdara (Delhi) to the District Judge, Ludhiana (Punjab) on the ground that she is not in a position to bear the litigation expenses and travelling expenses.
2. She also claims that she has two minor school going children whom she cannot leave behind alone. She also claims that she is suffering from hyperthyroid and incisional hernia and has been advised surgery. The husband has opposed these petitions and states that he is willing to pay all expenses for her travel to Ghaziabad and Delhi. He disputes that the wife is suffering from any ailment.
3.  In our view, in a matter like this, the convenience of the wife has to be looked into. In our view, the grounds are sufficient for transfer.
4.  We, therefore, direct for transfer of divorce petition being Suit No. 601 of 2003 titled Kulwinder Kumar v. Lalita pending in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Ghaziabad (U.P.) to the Court of the District Judge, Ludhiana (Punjab) and criminal proceedings being Complaint No. 459 of 2003 titled Kulwinder Kumar v. Hari Kishan Lal and Lalita pending in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Karkardooma Courts, Shahdara (Delhi) to the District Judge, Ludhiana (Punjab) who shall either try the cases himself or assign the same to a court of competent jurisdiction.
