State of Punjab and Others v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 August 1990
C.As. Nos. 83 to 90 of 1976. Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 3 April 1974, of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in General Sales Tax References Nos. 21 to 28 of 1972. The judgment of the High Court is reported at [1974] 34 STC 394
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Before the High Court [Union of India v. State of Punjab 1974 Indlaw PNH 36, the following two questions came up for consideration:
"1. Whether the petitioner is a 'dealer' within the meaning of section 2(d) of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948, and is liable to pay sales tax on its sales turnover ?
2. Whether, in the circumstances and on the facts of the case, no sales tax can be levied in view of the provisions of article 285 of the ?"
2.  The first question according to the High Court was concluded by the view taken by this Court in State of Tamil Nadu v. Thirumagal Mills Ltd., and in State of Andhra Pradesh v. H. Abdul Bakshi and Brothers. This aspect of the matter has not been seriously disputed and indeed cannot be dispute.
3.   On the second question, there remains little for consideration. There is no dispute that the Union of India is the owner of the Northern Railway Departmental Catering, Railway Station, Pathankot. The goods were purchased by the railways and were sold by the railways. The tax was imposed on the sale of goods. At the time of the sale, the goods belonged to the Railways. In view of the provisions of article 285(1) of the Constitution, such sales were immune from taxation under the State law. That was also the view of the High Court.
The appeal, therefore, is dismissed but no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
