1.  Mr Gupta, learned counsel for the appellant states that he withdraws the appeal as it has become infructuous in view of the subsequent action of the Prescribed Authority in issuing fresh notices to all the sons of the original appellant with respect to their lands as well as those left by the said appellant under the provisions of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act as amended in 1973 and the matter having already becomes final.
2.  The appeal is therefore dismissed as withdrawn with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
