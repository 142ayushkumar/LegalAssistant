Mysore Cement Limited v Union of India and Another
Supreme Court of India

23 April 1998
C.A. No. 2801 of 1982.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question involved in this appeal relates to the distribution of cement during the time when there was great scarcity in 1975-77. At that time, on suo motu action being taken, the MRTP Commission had come to the conclusion that the appellant herein was indulging in restrictive trade practice and even after the decontrol of cement, it should desist from doing so. This conclusion was arrived at on the basis that a major portion of cement meant for free sale was being sold only through three stockists.
2.  As of today, the scarcity of cement is no longer there. The control on the sale of cement is gone. In view of the circumstances which have radically changed, the learned counsel for the appellant states that without going into the question whether the appellant was or was not indulging in restrictive trade practice in the past, the appellant will not indulge in any restrictive trade practice in future.
3. Mr. N. N. Goswami, learned Senior for the respondents, states that as long as the appellant does not violate the provisions of the MRTP Act, no action will be taken against the appellant. This being so, no orders in this appeal are called for.
The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Appeal disposed of.
