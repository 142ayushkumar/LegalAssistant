State of Uttar Pradesh v Sanjiv Guddu and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 823/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We are of the definite opinion that the High Court should have re-appraised and re-evaluated the evidence in order to come to its own finding on the issues involved in the case. By refusing to grant leave the High Court has abdicated its jurisdiction.
2. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order. The leave applied for will stand granted. The appeal has now become regularised. Now, it is for the High Court to dispose of the appeal on merits. We are not expressing any opinion on the merits. This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
