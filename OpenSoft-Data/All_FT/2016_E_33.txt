1. Leave granted.
2. The appellants are before this Court aggrieved by an interim order passed by the learned Single Judge, Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 4658 of 2011 as confirmed in the Letters Patent Appeal No. 299 of 2011.
3. Now that the writ petition is pending, we are of the view that it would be appropriate if all contentions are addressed before the writ Court. Accordingly, appeals are disposed of with a request to the High Court of Bombay to dispose of writ petition No. 4658/2011 expeditiously and preferably within six months from today.
4. The interim order passed by this Court shall continue till the writ petition is disposed of by the High Court.
