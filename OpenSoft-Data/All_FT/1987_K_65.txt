S.L.Ps. (Civil) Nos. 460-461 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties at quite some length, we find that there is non-implementation of the court's order dated March 26, 1987.

We order accordingly.
2.  In modification of the said order, we direct that the Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Mandya shall prepare a list of life members eligible for voting at the elections  as per the formula set out .
3.   We clarify that the list of life members so eligible to vote at the elections who shall constitute the electoral college shall comprise not only of the signatories to the Rules and Regulations framed on August 26, 1972 but also comprise of such life members or patrons who had paid subscriptions and been admitted as life members or patrons of the Society, in accordance with the bye-laws, as on January 1, 1980. The Registrar shall ensure that he completes the process of elections within two months from today.
4.  Till the Administrator is appointed by the State Government under Section 27-A of the Act, the Collector, Mandya or an officer designated by him, shall take charge of the affairs of the Society, including the management of the Law College forthwith.
Special leave petitions are disposed of accordingly.
