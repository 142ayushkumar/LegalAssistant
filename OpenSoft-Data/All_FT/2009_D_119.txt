On payment of the said amount, we direct the CESTAT to expeditiously hear and dispose of Appeal No. 796 of 2006 preferred by the assessee, preferably within six to eight weeks.
5.  Before concluding, we may clarify that the amount of approximately Rupees twenty crores is lying deposited in the High Court on account of some inter se dispute in Suit No. 645 of 2006.
6. We make it clear that this order will not have any effect on the pending suit and the said amount of Rupees twenty crores shall remain deposited in the High Court till the disposal of Appeal No. 796 of 2006 by CESTAT.
