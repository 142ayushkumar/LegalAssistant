The Order of the Court was as follows:
We have heard counsel for the parties.
1.  It is not disputed that Nalin Solanki, Managing Director, the alleged contemnor, has since died. In this view of the matter the contempt petition has become infructuous. The contempt petition is, therefore, dismissed as having become infructuous.
2.  Counsel for the State submits that he may be permitted to take appropriate action against the authorities concerned.
3. Without expressing any opinion in the matter, we leave it open to the State to initiate such proceeding as it may deem appropriate.
Order accordingly.
