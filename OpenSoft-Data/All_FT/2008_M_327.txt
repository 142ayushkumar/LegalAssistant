Grindwell Norton Limited v Maxlux Glass Private Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 March 2008
Appeal (Crl.) 506 of 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  Although we cannot approve the manner in which the learned Magistrate preponed the date from 17.2.2000 to 1.2.2000, keeping in view the subsequent events, namely, the fact that the respondent has already deposited the amount of fine imposed upon him by the learned Magistrate as also the fact that the complainant-appellant has already withdrawn the amount in question, we are of the opinion that interest of justice would be sub served if the respondent is directed to pay a further sum of Rupees Fifty Thousand to the appellant in each case. We direct accordingly. The payment shall be made within four weeks.
The appeals are allowed with the aforementioned direction. No costs.
Appeals allowed.
