Central Bank of India and Anr v Jayant Maitra
Supreme Court of India

23 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.906/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The short question that arises for consideration in this Special Leave Petition is whether the letter submitted by the respondent on 3rd November, 1993 can be construed to be a letter of resignation so as to disentitle him the relief of pension, which is otherwise available in the case of a voluntary retirement. It is no doubt true that the Bank authorities have treated the same to be a letter of resignation. But on examining the language of the aforesaid letter and the terms contained therein, we are persuaded to come to a conclusion that the letter was one for voluntary retirement and not for resignation, and in that view of the matter, the Regulation of 1995 having come into force with effect from 1.11.1993, the benefits flowing from that Regulation cannot be denied to the respondent.
2. We therefore do not find any infirmity with the impugned order.
The Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
