Nil Kamal Ghosh Nilu v State of West Bengal
Supreme Court of India

9 October 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Cr.) No. 546/2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The appellant was convicted under Section 376 and Section 366 IPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and R.I for 6 years and a fine of Rs.1,000/- in default to suffer R.I for 5 months.
2.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we feel that the sentence for a period of 10 years would meet the ends of justice and sentence of life imprisonment is reduced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of ten years. It is submitted that the appellant has already undergone the imprisonment for 10 years. If the appellant has already undergone imprisonment for a period of 10 years, he is directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case.
3. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. The bail bonds shall stand discharged.
Appeal disposed of.
