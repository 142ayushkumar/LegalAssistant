Special Works and Research Centre Through Sanjit Roy and Others v State of Rajasthan
Supreme Court of India

26 September 1986
W.P. (Civil) Nos. 279, 282 and 337 of 1986
The order of the court was as follows:
Writ Petitions are adjourned to October 14, 1986.
1.  The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent states that the State Government is considering favourably the question of issuing a notification in accordance with the recommendations made by the Committee and the decision will be reached very shortly and if it is decided to issue such notification, it will be done without any delay before the next hearing of the writ petitions.
2.   But since the acceptance of the recommendations of the Committee an issue of notification in accordance therewith as well as the implementation of the interim order made by this Court for payment of minimum wages to workers engaged in drought relief work will involve a financial burden of almost rupees twenty crores, we hope and trust that the Central Government will provide necessary assistance to the State Government at an early date since the minimum wages required to be paid are for a work given by way of famine relief operations.
We would expect the Central Government to take up its decision at the earliest in order to enable the State Government to see that the workers who are engaged in famine relief work get their minimum wages. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent also states that the necessary directions have already been issued by the court but again a circular may be issued in order to ensure that earlier direction given by this Court by its order dated September 5, 1986 are fully implemented.
Order accordingly.
