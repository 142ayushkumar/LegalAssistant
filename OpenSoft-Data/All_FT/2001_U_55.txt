U.P. State Road Transport Corporation v Pawan Kumar Jain and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...4684/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This special leave petition is filed against an award of compensation to the extent of Rs.1,50,000/-.
2. The compensation has been awarded wherein a young child of three years has been crushed to death whilst in the bus itself by reason of a hole on the main platform of the bus.
3.  Learned Advocate appearing in support of the petition has also expressed his deep concern and, in his usual fairness he submits that UP State Road Transport Corporation should not have filed this petition.
4. We do appreciate such a gesture and by reason of the attitude taken on the part of the advocate we are not inclined to proceed with the matter for further orders so as to subserve the ends of justice.
The petition stands, however, thus dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
