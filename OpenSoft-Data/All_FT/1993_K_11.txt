Dy. Commissioner of Sales Tax (Law) Board of Revenue (Taxes) Kerala v K. P. Moideenkutty (Dead)
Supreme Court of India

31 March 1993
C.A. Nos. 2680-82 of 1979 with C.A. Nos. 2683-85 of 1979 and 1166-69 of 1980
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Rule 9(f) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Rules, 1963 (the Rules) provides that the amount specified and charged for by the dealer separately as freight, without including that amount in the price of goods sold, shall be deducted from the total turnover of the dealer for the purposes of assessing the dealer's liability under the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963.
2. In all these appeals the question for consideration before the High Court was whether the respondents-assessees were entitled to the benefit of Rule 9(f) of the Rules. The High Court answered the question in favour of the assesses and against the State. These appeals are by the State of Kerala against the judgments of the High Court.
C.A. Nos. 2680-82 of 1979:
3. The assessee in these appeals was a dealer in firewood. He had contracted with the Gwalior Rayons Ltd. for the purchase and sale of firewood. These appeals are in respect of the assessments to sales tax for the assessment years 1968-69, 1969-70 and 1970-71. The High Court on consideration of the material on the record reached the following finding:
"There is abundant material on record which has been referred to by the Tribunal itself and by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner to show that in the cases under consideration the transport authorities were specified and charged for separately under the rule."
4. The High Court granted the benefit of Rule 9(f) of the Rules to the assessee. We have been taken through the judgment of the High Court which is reported as Kutty and Co. v. State of Kerala 1978 Indlaw KER 50We agree with the reasoning and the conclusions reached therein. We see no ground to interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court. We, therefore, dismiss the appeals. No costs.
C.A. Nos. 2684-85 of 1979:
5. The assessee in these appeals was also a dealer of firewood and had contracted for the purchase and sale of firewood. The High Court, on the basis of the material before it, gave the benefit of Rule 9(f) of the Rules to the assessee. We see no ground to interfere with the reasoning and the conclusions reached by the High Court. The appeals are dismissed. No costs.
C.A. No. 2683 of 1979:
6. The assessee in this appeal was a dealer in bamboos. He had contracted for the purchase and sale of firewood. The assessee was given benefit of Rule 9(f) of the Rules. We see no ground to interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court. The appeal is dismissed. No costs.
C.A. Nos. 1166-1169 of 1980:
7. The question before the High Court was whether the assessee was entitled to the benefit of Rule 9(f) of the Rules. Following its earlier judgment in Kutty and Co. v. State of Kerala 1978 Indlaw KER 50 the High Court granted the benefit of the said rule to the assessee.
Since we have upheld the High Court judgment in Kutty and Co. v. State of Kerala  1978 Indlaw KER 50 by dismissing C.A. Nos. 2680-2682 of 1979, these appeals have to be dismissed. We order accordingly. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
