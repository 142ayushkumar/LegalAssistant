The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellants in these cases were employed on ad hoc basis in several colleges in the State of Punjab. There being a threat of termination of their services, they filed writ petitions before the High Court seeking for the relief of regularisation, minimum pay scale and to continue in their present posts until regular appointments are made.
All the reliefs were rejected by the High Court and so far as the relief relating to continue them in their present posts until regular incumbents are appointed, the High Court stated that the Government will have to follow its policy decision dated 23-7-2001.
2.  We have carefully looked into the judgment of the High Court and other pleadings that have been put forth before this Court. It is clear that though the appellants may not be entitled to regular appointment as such it cannot be said that they will not be entitled to the minimum of the pay scale nor that they should not be continued till regular incumbents are appointed.
The course adopted by the High Court is to displace one ad hoc arrangement by another ad hoc arrangement which is not at all appropriate for these persons who have gained experience which will be more beneficial and useful to the colleges concerned rather than to appoint persons afresh on ad hoc basis.
3. Therefore, we set aside the orders made by the High Court to the extent the same deny the claim of the appellants of minimum pay scale and continuation in service till regular incumbents are appointed. We direct that they shall be continued in service till regular appointments are made on minimum of the pay scale. The appeals shall stand allowed in part accordingly.
Appeal partly allowed.
