United India Insurance Co.Ltd v Shila Datta And Ors
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2007
Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No(s).17301-17302/2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Delay condoned.
2. Leave granted.
3. One of the contentions raised in these appeals is the correctness of a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd., Chandigarh vs. Nicolletta Rohtagi and Ors., 2002 Indlaw SC 1606, which is said to be pending consideration in a large number of cases before this Court.
Assailing the correctness of the aforesaid decision Mr. Atul Nanda submits that therein the liability of the insurer to reimburse the insured on two premises, namely, (1) just compensation; and (2) whose liability would be to pay, as envisaged under sub-s. (1) of S. 149 vis-a-vis the right of the aggrieved persons (which would include the insured) to prefer an appeal in terms of S. 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, had not been considered in the backdrop of the history in which subs. (1) of S. 149 was enacted.
4. Apart from the question raised by Mr. Nanda, we are of the opinion that the matter may be considered from other angles, namely, whether the insurer shall be wholly without any remedy even if the amount of compensation is determined in violation of the standard formula envisaged under the second schedule of the Act or in clear violation of the ratio(s) laid down by this Court.
5. We, therefore, are of the opinion that it is a fit case where the matter should be referred to larger Bench. We direct accordingly. Let the records of the case be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders. Liberty to mention.
6. The petitioner shall, however, deposit 50% of the amount awarded in favour of the respondents, together with interest subject, of course, to any adjustment which has already been deposited, within six weeks from date.
Order accordingly
