Rajindra Kumar and Company and Another v Vijaya Rani
Supreme Court of India

22 January 1981
C.A. No. 268 of 1981
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Special leave granted.
2. We think that the High Court was not within its jurisdiction in setting aside a finding which was really an inference of fact from the evidence.
3. We, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the order of the High Court and restore that of the trial court. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
