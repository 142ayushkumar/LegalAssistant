R. Ravichandran v P. Senthil Kumar
Supreme Court of India

31 March 2008
Criminal Appeal Nos. 588-589 of 2008 (Arising out of SLP (Crl.) Nos. 4639-4640/2007)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case and, particularly, in view of the fact that a sum of Rs.4,50,000/- has already been deposited by the appellant, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the Court below should be modified to the extent that the appellant would pay the said amount by way of compensation to the complainant-respondent. We direct accordingly. The sentence imposed on the appellant stands modified to the said extent. Since the amount of compensation of Rs.4,50,000/-, as indicated hereinbefore, has already been deposited by the appellant, no further order need be passed in this regard.
2.  However, it is made clear that the respondent would be entitled to withdraw the said amount.
The appeals are allowed with the aforementioned modification.
