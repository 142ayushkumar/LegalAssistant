11 August 2005
W.P. (Civil) No.537 of 1992
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. I.A. No.25 of 2005 has been filed by the petitioner, Cmdr.
2. Sureshwar D. Sinha, seeking directions to the respondents to take urgent measures mentioned in the application, including the opening of second lower tunnel, which, according to him, would increase the surface flows in the Bhagirathi downstream thereby reducing the volume of the dangerous flows into the deep acquifer so as to ensure the safety of the people living in upper Ganga-Yamuna basin. It is claimed that urgent actions mentioned in the application are required to be taken as they pertain to measures in the Bhagirathi basin to prevent massive destruction because of its water going into deep flows and no risk can be taken when safety of millions of people is involved. We direct Union of India, State of Uttaranchal and the Tehri Dam Management Authority to immediately look into the aspects pointed out in the application by involving the experts in the field. The response shall be filed in Court on 17th August, 2005, when the matter shall be listed again. The learned counsel for the Union of India would take steps to inform the State Government and the Tehri Dam Management Authority about this order.
3. If the respondents consider that some of the measures suggested in the application are to be taken immediately, they shall start taking those measures without waiting for directions from the Court.
List the matter as Item No.2 on 17th August, 2005.
Order accordingly
