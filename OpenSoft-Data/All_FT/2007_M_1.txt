Supreme Court of India

17  May  2007
IA No. 407 in W.P. (C) No. 1699 of 1987 with CP (C) No. D-15102 of 2003,
The Order of the Court was as follows:
IA No. 407 in WP (C) No. 1699 of 1987
1.  Only today we have delivered the judgment approving the Street Vendors Scheme of MCD and NDMC.
2.  Counsel for the applicant submits that his clients are high up in the seniority list and in all probability the hawking sites will be allotted to them, may be in a hawking/squatting area.
3.  Counsel for MCD states that within 2-3 months the exercise will be undertaken and the allotments made under the new scheme. If the applicant is high up in the seniority list, he should expect the allotment in about three months' time.
4.  We, therefore, do not pass any order today in this IA but we direct MCD to see to it that preferably within three months alternative sites are allotted to those who hold valid permission for hawking/squatting.
5.  In view of the order we have passed in IA No. 407, Contempt Petitions Nos. 4984-85 of 2003, 506 of 2002 and 215 of 2006 do not survive. These contempt petitions have therefore, become infructuous. These contempt petitions are dismissed as having become infructuous.
Contempt Petition (C) No. D-15102 of 2003
6.  It is submitted on behalf of the applicant that their right to squat was recognised and saved by at least three orders of this Court dated 1-12-1997, 28-8-1998, Footpath Dukandar New Lajpatrai Market Patri Union Regd. v. MCD 1998 Indlaw SC 2271 and 1-12-2000, Rajendra Kumar v. MCD2000 Indlaw SC 3926. Despite that, they were removed sometime in the year 2003. Their grievance further is that though they have been removed, a large number of other squatters are still squatting on the plots in question. He further apprehends that under the new scheme his claim may be ignored.
7.  Mr Sen appearing on behalf of MCD submits that the apprehension of the applicant is not justified because the applicants are persons who have been given permission to squat by the authorities. They will be eligible for allotment in any event. Their seniority will not be adversely affected by the new scheme. Their seniority will be retained and their claims shall be considered in accordance with the new scheme giving them due seniority and their absence from the market will not stand in their way.
8.  However, in the meantime, if MCD can find available alternative squatting sites nearabout Lajpat Nagar or in any other designated zone, they shall permit the applicants to carry on their hawking business on those sites. If there are any such hawking sites available, it will be open to the applicants to furnish necessary particulars of those sites to MCD to enable them to consider allotment of alternative sites.
9.  If such sites are identified by the applicants, MCD will take steps forthwith to consider allotment of such sites in favour of the applicants and not later than three weeks after the sites are identified and found to be available for allotment. The contempt petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petitions disposed of.
