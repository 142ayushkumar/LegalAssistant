Commissioner of Income Tax v R. Lingmallu Raghukumar
Supreme Court of India

15 January 1997
C.A. No. 3384 of 1983 (Arising as an appeal from the judgment and order Dt. 21 July 1982 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in R.C. No. 28 of 1977).
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  This appeal by the Revenue is directed against the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated July 21, 1982, 1982 Indlaw AP 81, in Referred Case No. 28 of 1977, whereby the following question of law referred to the High Court was answered against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the excess amount of Rs. 46, 500 received by the assessee on retirement from the two partnership firms is assessable to capital gains ?"
2.  The High Court has held that there was no transfer of any assets as contemplated by the expression "transfer" as defined in s. 2(47) of the Income-tax Act. The High Court had placed reliance on the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in CIT v. Mohanbhai Pamabhai, 1971 Indlaw GUJ 17, wherein it has been held that where a partner retires from a partnership and the amount of his share in the net partnership assets after deduction of liabilities and prior charges is determined on taking accounts in the manner prescribed by the relevant provisions of the partnership law there is no element of transfer of interest in the partnership assets by the retired partner to the continuing partners. The said judgment of the Gujarat High Court has been affirmed by this court in Addl. CIT v. Mohanbhai Pamabhai, 1987 Indlaw SC 28732. In view of the said judgment we find no merit in this appeal and the same is, therefore, dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal Dismissed.
