Nirmal Kumar Gupta v Central Bureau of Investigation
Supreme Court of India

23 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3212/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Upon hearing the submissions made on behalf of thee parties, we do feel it expedient to record that there has not been proper appreciation of the matter by the High Court on merits. As such, the order impugned in the appeal cannot be sustained.
The order is, therefore, set aside and the matter is, however, remanded back to the High Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law upon affording an opportunity to the parties. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
