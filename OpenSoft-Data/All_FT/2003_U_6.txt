U.K. Tripathi v Jaindra Singh and others
Supreme Court of India

4 February 2003
C.A. No. 7768 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. It appears to us that the amount to compensation awarded by the Tribunal as well as the High Court in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case is on the lower side.
2. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the interest of justice would be subserved having regard to the fact that the appellant herein was treated for 45 days in hospital, for 77 days as an out-patient and his total period of treatment being 274 days, if a further sum of Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) is awarded to him by way of compensation along with interest on the enhanced amount at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from the date of filing of the application. Ordered accordingly. The appeal stands disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
