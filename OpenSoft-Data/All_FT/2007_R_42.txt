Supreme Court of India

24 September 2007
Appeal (civil) 2181-2182 of 2001 IN I.A. No.15-16 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. I.A. No. 15-16 for clarification and direction of Court's Order dated 3.5.2007 are totally misconceived. Moreover, ordinarily nos. I.A. lies after a case is finally disposed of. Ordinarily, an I.A. is maintainable only in a pending case.
Once a case is finally disposed of the Court becomes functus officio, and thereafter an I.A. lies ordinarily only for correcting clerical or accidental mistakes. The same are accordingly, dismissed.
3. Put up the Contempt Petitions (C) No. 151 -152 of 2007 in Civil Appeal No. 2181-2182 of 2001 after six months.
Order accordingly
