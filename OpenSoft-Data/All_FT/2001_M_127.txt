Messrs Johari Forts and Palaces Private Limited v Maharaja Narendra Singh of Bikaner and Another
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12921/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Inviting our attention to Minutes dated 17th January, 2000 recorded by Arbitral Tribunal, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the Arbitral Tribunal is not functional and, therefore, the view taken by the High Court awaiting the decision of Arbitral Tribunal of the existence and veracity of arbitration agreement is not workable.
2. However, such a plea does not appear to have been placed for the consideration of the High Court. On being pointed out the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioners would be advised to invite the attention of the High Court to this plea and seek review of the impugned order. We grant that liberty to the petitioner and dismiss the Special Leave Petition as withdrawn.
Petition Dismissed.
