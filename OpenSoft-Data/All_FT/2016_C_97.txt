Committee of Management Jan Sewa Shiksha Prasar Samiti and others v State of U.P. and others
Supreme Court of India

25 November 2016
Civil Appeal No. 11582 of 2016
(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. Heard learned counsel for the appellant and the Respondent No.3, who has appeared on caveat.
3. After arguing the case for some time, it was brought to our notice by the learned counsel that the elections are being held.
4. Therefore, we do not propose to interfere with the subject matter. However, we find that the liberty granted by the High Court to the appellant to approach the Civil Court may not be correct, since it is the Statutory Authority, which has to look into the issue. To that extent the impugned judgment shall stand modified.
5. With the above observations and modification the appeal stands disposed of.
5. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
6. No costs.
Appeal disposed of
