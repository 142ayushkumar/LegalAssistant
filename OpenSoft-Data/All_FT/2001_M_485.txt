Mukesh and Others v Chief Officer, Municipal Council and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.5799/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the present appellants in limine, inter alia, on the ground that it was supposed to be in the public interest.
2.  We have read the writ petition and are of the view that it is not filed in the public interest but in the private interest of the writ petitioners. There is also an explanation given in regard to the civil suit to which the order of summary dismissal makes reference.
3. All things considered, we are of the view that the writ petition deserves to be heard on its merits. But we do not dilate because we do not desire to prejudice the case on either side.
4.  The civil appeal is allowed. The order under challenge is set aside. The writ petition (No.4277 of 2000) is restored to the file of the Nagpur Bench of the High Court at Bombay to be heard and disposed of afresh.
Appeal allowed.
