New Bank of India v M/s. Hotel Tourist
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2003
C.A. No. 2987 of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 6857 of 2002)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard both sides.
1.  The respondent herein let out a building to the appellant-Bank for using it as an Office. The respondent filed eviction petition and the eviction was granted and the matter reached this Court by way of SLP and the SLP was dismissed. However, the Appellant-Bank was allowed to continue till 30th September, 1989 on furnishing undertaking that the Bank would pay rent at the rate of Rs. 22,385/- per month till the Bank vacated the premises. Thereafter, the Bank published an advertisement seeking accommodation and the respondent herein offered its premises and sent a letter dated 12.6.89 to the appellant-Bank wherein the respondent stated that they were prepared to give premises on a monthly rent of Rs. 22,385/- per month and the letter also stated that a lease deed would be executed for a period of 5 years and there would be renewal for another period of 5 years with increase of 15% in the monthly rent.    Thus the appellant-Bank continued to be in possession of the building and on 26.9.1998 the respondent filed an execution petition before Subordinate Judge, Patna. The respondent contended that the appellant Bank had been in unauthorised occupation of the building and hence liable to pay compensation for use and occupation at the market rate. The learned Subordinate Judge fixed the compensation at the rate of Rs. 15/- per sq.ft. which would approximately come to Rs. 70,000/- per month. This order was challenged by the appellant-Bank before the High Court and the learned Single Judge by the impugned order held that the appellant was in unauthorised occupation, liable to pay Rs. 30,000/- as damages for use and occupation from 1st October, 1989 till vacant possession is given.
2.  Counsel for the appellant-Bank pointed out that though the appellant executed a bond before this Court agreeing to vacate the premises, the appellant was allowed to continue in the premises in view of the letter dated 12.6.1989 by the respondent. It is submitted that the respondent agreed to give the premises again on payment of Rs. 22,385/- per month and therefore, the respondent is not entitled to claim any thing more than this amount. The counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that as the appellant had given an undertaking before this Court, there was no need to file execution petition and the appellant was legally bound to surrender possession.
3. It is pertinent to note that the respondent agreed to have a fresh lease for a period of 5 years on 12.6.1989, and they also agreed that monthly rent shall be Rs. 22,385/-. Therefore for a period of 5 years from the date of the letter viz. 12.6.1989, the respondent is not entitled to get any amount more than Rs. 22,385/- p.m. It is not in dispute that the said amount has already been paid.
4.  Having regard to the above facts, we hold that from 1.7.1994 the appellant shall pay to the respondents at the rate of Rs. 30,000/- per month as damages for use and occupation till the premises are vacated by the appellant. For this period if the appellant had already paid at the rate of Rs. 22,385/- per month the balance amount shall be paid by the appellant. The order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High court shall stand modified to the extent indicated above.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
