Shyam Lal and Others v Dy.Dir. of Consolidation, Ghazipur and Others
Supreme Court of India

16 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14140/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  When appellants challenged the order passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation, the High Court disposed of the said challenge by a cryptic order which reads thus:
"After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner I find no force in this petition. The petition is dismissed accordingly."
2.  What arguments of the learned counsel appeared to the learned judge, without force etc., have not been referred to in the impugned order. In view of the stark want of any reasoning we are compelled to interfere with the impugned order. It is accordingly set aside. The High Court will dispose of the writ petition afresh. This appeal is accordingly disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
