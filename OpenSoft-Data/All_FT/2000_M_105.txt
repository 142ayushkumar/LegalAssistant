10 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.2545/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The only question for our consideration is, whether the court below is justified in rejecting the proposed amendment of the plaint by the appellant.
2. The ground for rejection is that the amendment brings in the relief which is barred by time. Submission for the appellant is, that it is not barred by time. However, it is not necessary for us to enter into the merits on this issue.
3.  It is open to the parties, when the matter is taken upa on merit at trial to raise such issues. In the interest of justice we feel it appropriate that the amendment sought for was wrongly rejected.
4. This amendment is allowed without prejudice to the rights of the parties to raise all questions under it. The respondent would be entitled for filing the additional written statement.
5.  With the above observation the present appeal is allowed. The impugned orders are set aside. Costs on the parties.
Appeal allowed.
