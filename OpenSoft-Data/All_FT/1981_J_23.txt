Jora and Another v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

6 March 1981
Cr.A. No. 246 of 1981
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1. Special leave granted to Jora
2. We think that having regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case and particularly in view of the fact that Jora is about 76 years old and he was not guilty of any overt act in strangulating the deceased Jagrant and he had been in jail for about 19 months, it will meet the ends of justice, if the sentence imposed on Jora is reduced to that already undergone by him.
3. We accordingly allow the appeal so far as Jora is concerned and reduce the sentence imposed on him to that already undergone and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith
Appeal disposed of.
