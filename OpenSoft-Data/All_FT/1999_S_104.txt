Rambabu and Others v Secretary To Government Finance and Planning Department and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 January 1999
C.A. Nos. 82-83/1999, Dt. 11 January 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard counsel on both sides. It is argued by the learned Senior for the appellants that in the light of an order passed by this Court in Distt. Collector/Chairman v. T. Devenderpal Singh 1998 Indlaw SC 2237 the order under appeal remanding the matter to the learned single Judge cannot be sustained.
2. It is further brought to our notice that the order of the learned single Judge of the High Court was in conformity with the order passed by this Court on February 6, 1998 except for a small clarification. This is not disputed by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents.
3.  In the circumstances, we set aside the order under appeal and while upholding the order of the learned single Judge make it clear that the other conditions laid down in G.O.Ms. No. 212 dated April 22, 1994 will have to be satisfied for the purposes of regularisation. Subject to this modification, the order of the learned single Judge stands and the order of the Division Bench is set aside. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
