Shree Synthetics Limited v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 January 1995
C.A. No. 296 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Since the paper books of this appeal could not be traced, the Registry wrote a letter to Mr. A. K. Gambhir, Advocate for the appellant, on December 19, 1994 to furnish three additional sets of paper books by 24th December, 1994 but that has not been done. The letter is not even acknowledged.
2. Although the matter is shown on board for disposal Mr. Gambhir is not present. We have perused the points raised in the Memo of Appeal and have perused the original file of the Court and we find that the main question stands covered by the decision of this Court in Wallace Flour Mills Co. Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay 1989 Indlaw SC 2501989 Indlaw SC 250.
3.  In that case this Court held that even though the taxable event is the manufacture or production of an excisable article, the duty can be levied and collected at a later stage for administrative convenience. The scheme of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 read with the relevant Rules framed under the Act and in particular Rule 9A, it becomes evident that the taxable event is indeed the manufacture and production of excisable article but the payment of duty is relatable to the date of removal of such article from the factory.
4. In that view of the matter, the main contention raised in this appeal stands covered by the decision of this Court. It is not shown how Rule 9A is ultra vires Section 3 of the Act since it is consistent with the scheme of the Act as observed in the aforesaid decision. We, therefore, do not see any substance in this appeal
The appeal stands dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
