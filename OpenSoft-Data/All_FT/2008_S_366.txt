Lavanya S v Sivaramakrishnan S
Supreme Court of India

8 September 2008
Transfer Petition (C.) No.310 Of 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard both sides.
1.  Petitioner-wife is before us seeking transfer of the case filed under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act. The petitioner-wife is now working and residing at Noida (U.P.). The respondent-husband is working in U.S.A. As it is convenient for the respondent also to appear before the Court at Delhi, we direct the transfer of M.O.P.No.105/07 pending before the Sub- Court at Chengalpet, Tamil Nadu to the District Judge, Tis Hazari, Delhi. All the records will be sent to the transferee court. The transfer petition is allowed accordingly.
2.  The learned counsel for the respondent submits that as he is staying out of India, it is difficult for him to attend. He would be free to make an application before the trial court seeking appropriate relief.
Petition allowed
