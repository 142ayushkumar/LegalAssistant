K. Veeraswami v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

18 September 1991
Review Petition No. 744 of 1991 in Cr.A. No. 400 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have considered the prayer of the petitioner to list the review petition for hearing along with the writ petition said to have been filed under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking a declaration that the judgment under review be declared as per incuriam, null and void etc., and also the request of the petitioner to dispose of the review petition in the open court instead of by circulation. The first prayer is indeed extraordinary.
2. We do not consider it appropriate to list the review petition along with the writ petition said to have been filed. In our opinion, it is also not necessary to hear the review petition in the open court. Both the prayers are hereby rejected.
3.  We have examined the grounds raised in the review petition and we find that there is no substance in any one of the grounds. The review petition is accordingly dismissed.
Review dismissed.
