State Bank of India and others v Akeel Ahmed Khan
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2005
C.A. No. 2410 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 5028 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This is a case of compassionate appointment. The High Court has directed reconsideration of the case of the respondent in the light of the three instances, namely, the instances of the Chief Manager Mr P.K. Nath, Mr K.J. Rajgoplan, Assistant Manager and Mr Javed Akhtar, General Manager, Delhi Circle, where the relatives of these persons have been given compassionate appointment. The fact that the compassionate appointments were given in these three cases is not disputed by the appellants.
2. However, they say that there are distinguishing factors between the compassionate appointment given in that case and the appellant's case. We are not prepared to carry out the enquiry ourselves but the matter must be considered in depth by the authority concerned. It is being made clear that whatever principle was followed in granting compassionate appointment in respect of the aforesaid three employees must also be followed as far as the appellant is concerned.
3.  The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of but without any order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
