Food Corporation of India and others v Rice Millers Association, District
Supreme Court of India

22 July 2016
Civil Appeal No. 6621 of 2016, [Special Leave Petition (C) No. 16607 of 2016]
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. The limited request made by Mr. N. K. Kaul, learned Additional Solicitor General, is that the interest of the appellants may be protected by issuing a direction to the respondents that they should furnish Bank Guarantee for claiming the difference between old and new rates. This is a point, apparently not canvassed before the High Court and it is for the appellants to apprise this point to the High Court.
3. Therefore, with liberty to the appellants to approach the High Court in that regard, this appeal is disposed of.
4. We request the High Court to dispose of the writ petition expeditiously and preferably within six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this Judgment.
5. No costs.
Petition disposed of
