Muzafar Hussain Mohammed Shaikh and Others v Thane Municipal Corporation and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.5005/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The grievance of the appellants in this matter is in respect of the seniority list published on 21.6.1986. The High Court disposed of the matter stating that inasmuch as objections to the list had been rejected and thereafter the petitioners have become inactive the matter cannot be gone into and they should have sought for amendment of the petition for challenging the order or taking appropriate steps in that regard. We do not think that is a satisfactory way of disposing of the matter. The appropriate course would have been to allow the appellants to challenge the order by which they were affected and thereafter proceed with the matter.
2. In these circumstances, we set aside the order made by the High Court, which is under appeal and remit the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
