Union of India and Another v Munshi Ram and Another
Supreme Court of India

5 October 1983
C.As. Nos. 6738 and 6739 of 1983 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) Nos. 9505-22 of 1981).
The Judgment was delivered by: Venkataramiah, J.
1. Special leave granted.
2.  In Union of India v. Smt. Shanti Devi 1983 Indlaw SC 99  we have held that for the lands acquired for the Beas Project in the years 1962 and 1963 compensation should be calculated by applying fifteen years purchase rule instead of twenty years' purchase rule.
3. In these appeals which are connected with the above-mentioned cases, we make a similar direction. Consequently the compensation awarded on lands in these cases is reduced by one fourth. The solatium of 15 per cent and interest payable on the compensation shall be computed accordingly.
The appeals are, therefore, allowed in part and the orders of the High Court shall stand modified accordingly. Parties shall bear their own costs throughout.
Appeal partly allowed.
