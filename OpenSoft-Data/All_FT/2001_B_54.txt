Ranglal Ganeshlal Jain v Bachubhai Dehyabhai
Supreme Court of India

3 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16584/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We are informed that sole respondent died on 26th December, 1996 when the matter was pending in the High Court.
2.  The only submission made on behalf of the appellant is that it was incumbant on the respondent to inform the appellants about the death. As appellant was not aware, even the present petition is filed against the impugned judgment impleading dead respondent.
3. Since sole respondent died much before the judgment given by the High Court, it is proper that the petitioner move the matter before the High Court, as judgment against dead person would be a nullity. Thus present perition is not maintainable.
4.  Liberty is granted to the appellant to move the High Court in this regard. With this observations this petition is disposed of. Interim order shall continue for four weeks from today.
Petition disposed of.
