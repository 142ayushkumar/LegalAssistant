Workmen of Buckingham and Carnatic Mills, Madras and Others v State of Tamilnadu and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 December 1982
C.A. No. 2046 of 1982,
The Judgment was delivered by: DESAI, J.
1. The narrow question involved in this matter is whether a reference under S.36A of the Industrial Disputes Act for interpretation and enforcement of settlement between the Workmen of the Buckingham Mills and Management of the Buckingham Mills ought to be made to the Industrial Tribunal.
2.  We heard Sri C. S. Vaidyanathan, learned counsel for the appellant and Sri A. V. Rangam, learned counsel for the State and G. P. Pai, learned counsel for the mills-management.
3.  Having considered all aspects of the matter, we are satisfied that a reference ought to have been made under S.36A of the Industrial Disputes Act and we accordingly issue a writ of Mandamus directing the State of Tamilnadu to make a reference for interpretation and implementation of tripartite settlement, dated 6th June, 1981 to the authority to whom it could be made under S.36A of the Act within thirty days from today.
4.  The appeal is disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs. The other points involved in the appeal are also raised in the writ petition and the disposal of the appeal would not amount to rejection of the points and they are kept open.
Appeal disposed of.
