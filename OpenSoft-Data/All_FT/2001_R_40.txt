The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In respect of the employees working in the Dairy Development departmnet of the State of Maharashtra a Suo Moto Writ petition No. 4756/1998 dated 20.4.1989 had been filed.
2. The learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra conceded that after completion of 240 days of continous service, the employees are entitled to be confirmed in the post held by them. Since this position has been conceded and the view taken by the High Court is consistent with that stand we do not think that there is any good reason for us to interfere with the order made by the High Court.
The appeals stand dismissed accordingly.
