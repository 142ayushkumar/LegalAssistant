Narayani Devi v Mahendra Kr. Tripathi and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 January 1997
S.L.P. (C) No. 4968 of 1997 with S.L.P. (C) No. 8481 of 1997 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 3 January 1997 in C.M.W.P. No. 64 of 1997 of the High Court of Allahabad), Dt. 19 December 1997.
The Order of the Court was as follows :
S.L.P. (C) No. 4968 of 1997
1.  In the impugned order dated 3-1-1997, the High Court has observed that M. K. Tripathi, the 1st respondent herein, would be permitted to contest the proceedings for allotment or release, as the case may be, and after a final order of allotment or release has been passed, he would be entitled to file a revision under Section 18 of the U.P. Act 13 of 1972.
2. It is the admitted position that a revision in that eventuality would not lie. It has been urged that the said direction be read as if the High Court was permitting the said respondent to move in a writ petition in the event of the final order of allotment or release going against him. As suggested, it is so clarified. With these observations, S.L.P. (C) No. 4968 of 1997 preferred by Smt. Narayani Devi would stand disposed of.
S.L.P. (C) No. 8481 of 1997
This cross-petition is dismissed on merit.
Petition dismissed.
