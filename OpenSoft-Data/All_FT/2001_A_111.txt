Union Public Service Commission v Ajaya Kumar Das and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10995/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The respondent was working as an Assistant Audit Officer. In November 1989, he had taken the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination.
2.  An advertisement had appeared whereby for induction to the Audit and Accounts Services Examination, 1995 the eligibility criteria was that a candidate should satisfy the eligibility conditions on 1st January, 1995 one of which was the following condition :
"(I) SCALE OF PAY AND LENGTH OF SERVICE The candidates should be holding post in the scale of pay of Rs.2000-3000 or above and should have rendered not less than 5 years regular service after qualifying in the Subordinate Accounts Service or Section Officers' Grade Examination or an equivalent examination conducted by the concerned Department"
3. Admittedly, the result had been declared in March 1990. Counting from that date, the five years qualifying period would end in March 1995. Therefore, as on 1st January, 1995, the respondent did not have five years' regular service after qualifying in the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination.
4.  The High Court held that the results which were declared in March 1990 will relate back to the date of the examination in 1989. This, in our opinion is an incorrect proposition of law. There can be no question of relating back. The condition of eligibility was very clear. It had to be five years' service after qualifying as on 1st January, 1995 and in this view we are supported by a decision of this Court in Ashok Kumar Sharma and Others vs. Chander Shekhar and Another, 1997 Indlaw SC 2621.
5.  For the aforesaid reason, this appeal is allowed and the decision of the High Court is set aside.
Appeal allowed.
