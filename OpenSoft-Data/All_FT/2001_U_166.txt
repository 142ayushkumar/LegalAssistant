Union of India and Others v Sps Dhinda N. M
Supreme Court of India

17 January 2001
C.As. No. 7804 of 1997 With Nos. 7805-08 of 1997, Ias Nos. 5 and 6, S.L.P. (C) No. 18889 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted in SLP (Civil) No. 18889 of 1998.
Applications for restoration/intervention are dismissed as withdrawn.
1.  In all these matters when the arguments proceeded, the main point emphasised is this:
2.  Whether the Court Martial has power u/s. 71 of the Army Act, while imposing punishment, to deal with pensionary benefits. If the Court Martial has the power, can the power under non-statutory regulations like Regulations 16(a) and 113 of the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961 Part I be further exercised to forfeit the pensionary benefits of an officer ? [Regulation 16(a) is intended to apply to commissioned officers and Regulation 113 is intended to apply to personnel below the rank of officers, otherwise both the Regulations are identical.]
3.  Mr. P. P. Malhotra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Union of India invited our attention to a two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Union of India v. Brig. P. K. Dutta (Retd.) 1994 Indlaw SC 21491994 Indlaw SC 2149 in which the question was considered whether S. 71(h) of the Army Act and Regulation 16(a) of the Pension Regulations would overlap each other and it was held that they are intended to cover two different stages of two different fields.
4.  Mr. Harish Uppal, learned counsel invited our attention to an unreported three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Lt. Col. (T.S.) Harbans Singh Sandhu v. Union of India (by Hon'ble V. R. Krishna Iyer, P. S. Kailasam and A. D. Koshal, JJ.) and contended that the observations therein had taken a different stand, but unfortunately the said decision was not brought to the notice of the two-Judge Bench while dealing with Brig. P. K. Dutta case 1994 Indlaw SC 21491994 Indlaw SC 2149.
5.  Mr. PP. Malhotra, learned Senior Counsel contended that the three-Judge Bench decision referred to above had not taken a different view.
6.  We deem it necessary that this question is heard and decided by a larger Bench, due to the importance of its application to personnel in the Defence Department. Hence, these appeals can be placed for appropriate orders of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India.
Order accordlingy.
