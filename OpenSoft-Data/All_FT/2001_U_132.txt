Union of India and Others v Bramarbar Jena and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11253/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The Central Administrative Tribunal while disposing of an original application filed by the respondents directed the appellants to accommodate such of those respondents who are found suitable when vacancies arise in the post of Typist.
2.  The Tribunal also provided a rider like this "till then the appellants should be employed as work charged Khalasis".
3.  Before the said order was challenged in the High Court the appellants filed a review petition before the Tribunal but that petition was dismissed on the ground that there was no error apparent on the face of the record. Thereafter a writ petition was filed before the High Court of Orissa challenging the main order passed by the Tribunal dated 21.1.1993 as well as the order passed by the Tribunal on the review application.
4.  A Division Bench of the High Court has dismissed the writ petition by the impugned order.
5.  A reading of the impugned order shows that the Division Bench considered whether the Tribunal could have reviewed its order as there was no error apparent on the face of the record. The review jurisdiction was not exerciseable according to the High Court. But we have to point out that such writ petition was in challenge of the mention as well the High Court could have gone into the merits of the contentions of the appellants whether the rider mentioned above was necessary to be incorporated for which all the pros and cons should be taken into account.
6. We feel that the High Court should dispose of the writ petition afresh. For that purpose we set aside the impugned order and remit the matter back to the High Court for disposal of the writ petition afresh.
This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
