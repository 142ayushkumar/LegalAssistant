State of Haryana and Others v Ishwar Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7463/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  This is an appeal by the State of Haryana against the judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dated 23.9.99 in CWP No.18043/98. The parity in pay was granted to the doctors/respondents category alongwith Executive Branch, by an order dated 2.6.89 and when Selection Grade posts were also sanctioned at par with the Executive Branch. The order unfortunately did not mention that the Selection Grade posts were restricted to 20% of the posts.
2. This mistake was, however, rectified by an order dated 16.5.90 of the Government with retrospective effect 1.5.89. The High Court has now held that Selection Grade is to be granted without restriction to 20% of the posts in the particular cadre.
3.  It is well known that in every department Selection Grade is restricted to certain percentage of the posts such as 20% in the present case. So merely because the percentage was not mentioned in the earlier order dated 2.6.89, the High Court could not have awarded Selection Grade to every member in the cadre.
4.  The High Court should have seen that the mistake in the order dated 2.6.89 was rectified. We therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court and direct that the Selection Grade scale of Rs. 4100-5300/- will be restricted to 20% of the posts in the cadre as provided in the clarification dated 16.5.90.
5.  The appeal is allowed accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
