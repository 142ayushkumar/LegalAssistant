While the miscellaneous application filed in these writ petitions being CMP No. 7667 of 1987, was disposed of by order dated 3-8-1987, by oversight it was not stated therein that there was no further order necessary in the writ petitions in view of what has been stated in the order on that date.

There would be no order for costs.
Petitions disposed of.
