Arunaben T. Bhojak v Secretary, Ahmedabad Education Society, Lal Bhawan, Badra, Ahmedabad and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 January 1995
C.A. No. 3010 of 1995 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 22 November 1993 of the Gujarat High Court in L.P.A. No. 161 of 1987)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal by special leave arises against the order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat in LPA No. 161 of 1987 dated 22-11-1993. The appellant admittedly belongs to Bakshi Panch which is one of the Nomadic Tribes, notified as a Scheduled Tribe in the State of Gujarat. The Gujarat University had published a notification called for recruitment to the post of Lecturer (Psychology). Initially though the appellant was available, she was not selected.
2.   Consequently, the contesting respondent came to be selected and sought to be appointed. The appellant ultimately went to the court. Pending appeal, she was selected and appointed and has now been working as Lecturer (Psychology) in the Gujarat University. The Division Bench of the High Court held that when the selection was made, she was not found to be suitable. The requisite qualifications were not sufficient for appellant's claim to the post.
3.  We are unable to appreciate the reasoning of the Division Bench. It is true that initially the respondent did not have the laboratory experience but later on she had acquired that experience. She was also eligible an was accordingly appointed.
Admittedly, the post was reserved for the Scheduled Tribes and when a Scheduled Tribe candidate is available, his/her appointment cannot be held per se illegal.  Therefore, the High Court was not right in negativing the right of the appellant in this behalf.
4.  The appeal is accordingly allowed. The appointment made to the appellant shall continue as one reserved for Scheduled Tribes. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
