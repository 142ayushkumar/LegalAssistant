State of Punjab v Mohinder Singh and Another
Status:  
							 Negative Judicial Treatment
Supreme Court of India

1  May  1985
C.A. No. 3267 of 1979.
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Heard counsel for the parties. We find no merit in this appeal so far as quantum of compensation is concerned, because special leave petition has been dismissed against the impugned judgment.
2.   However, the respondents are entitled to the benefit of the provisions of Act 68 of 1984 by which 30% solatium is to be given from the date of publication to the date of notification under Section 4, sub-s. (1) of the Act, the interest at the rate of 9% instead of 6%, as originally contained in the unamended Act, from the date of taking possession of the land acquired. Since the decision in this case has been given after one year, it is manifest that under the said Act, respondents would be entitled to interest at the rate of 9% towards which they have already got 6%.
With the above observation, we dismiss the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
