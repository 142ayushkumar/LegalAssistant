State of Rajasthan v Radha Krishan Karwashra and others
Supreme Court of India

28 March 2006
C.A. Nos. 5338 and 5340-41 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It was submitted by Mr. Badridas Sharma, learned Counsel for the appellants, that the above appeals are of an entirely different type in which the respondent had challenged the order dated 25.04.1998 of the Avas Vikas Sansthan and by that letter/order, it was pointed out that 10 employees including Mr. Radha Krishan Karwashra had not accepted to join and do the alternative work offered to them and, therefore, those persons were treated as no more in the service of the Avas Vikas Sansthan. That the order of 25.04.1998 was not at all related to dismissal of service of employees as a result of dissolution of the Society.
2.  It was submitted that the writ petitions challenging the said order dated 25.04.1998 are still pending in the High Court at Jaipur in writ petition Nos. 5370/1998 and 5383/1998. Since this fact was pointed out by Mr. Badridas Sharma during the time of hearing of these appeals, we do not consider the merits of the claim made in this appeal.
3. In view of this, the above appeals are delinked from the batch of appeals in Civil Appeal Nos. 5302/2004 etc. etc. and disposed of accordingly. Both parties are at liberty to pursue the pending writ petitions before the High Court in accordance with law. No costs.
Appeals disposed of.
