State of Maharashtra and Others v Shri Krishna Trading Company and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 February 1992
C.A. No. 815 of 1992 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 15468 of 1990)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties. Special leave is granted.
1.  In view of the order which we are proposing to pass, it is not necessary to set out the facts in detail. A writ petition filed by the respondents out of which the present matter arises was dismissed in 1984 by a reasoned judgment running into 10 long pages. Subsequently, a review application was filed, which has been allowed by a perfunctory order of a few lines darted November 17, 1989. This is under challenge in the present case. The complaint is that the order does not deal with the question reagitated by the review petitioners nor does it assign reasons for reviewing the earlier judgment.
2.  The grounds appear to be well founded and accordingly we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned order dated November 17, 1989 and remit the Civil Application No. 5173 of 1989 (for review) to the High Court for reconsideration and disposal by a reasoned judgment. We agree with the learned counsel for the respondents that the matter is fit to be disposed of by the High Court expeditiously.
Appeal allowed.
