Bongaigaon Refinary and Petrochemicals Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

24 July 2001
C.A. No. 3024 of 1999 (Arising as an appeal from the judgment and order Dt. 29 July 1998, of the Gauhati High Court in I.T.R. No. 6 of 1989).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The order under challenge was passed on a reference to the High Court  1998 Indlaw GUW 65, under the Income-tax Act, 1961, made at the instance of the Revenue.
2. The High Court answered in the negative and against the assessee the following question:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that the items of income derived by the assessee during the formation period for the main business, were not taxable income but were to be adjusted against the project cost for the oil refinery and petrochemicals, the main business for which the company was set up ?"
3.  It did so based upon the decision of this court in Taticorin Alkali Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd. v. CIT 1997 Indlaw SC 3320.
4.  That was a case in which the question related to interest earned by a company during its formative period by investments. This court has held in CIT v. Bokaro Steel Ltd. 1998 Indlaw SC 1885, that it is so confined and did not apply where the receipts were directly connected with or were incidental to the work of construction of the assessee's plant.
5. The decision in CIT v. Bokaro Steel Ltd. 1998 Indlaw SC 1885(SC) has been followed by a two-judge Bench of this court in CIT v. Karnal Co-operative Sugar Mills Ltd. 1999 Indlaw SC 1260 and by a three-judge Bench in CIT v. Karnataka Power Corporation 2000 Indlaw SC 637.
6.  In fact, in the latter case, it was not disputed by the Revenue that the question that related to hire charges paid by contractors had to be answered in the light of the judgment in Bokaro Steel Ltd.'s case 1998 Indlaw SC 1885(SC).
7. It is, therefore, not possible now to take any view different from that taken in Bokaro Steel Ltd.'s case 1998 Indlaw SC 1885(SC). The High Court has already held that the interest income derived by the assessee during its formative period was taxable income. What remains for consideration is the income which the assessee derived from house property, its guest house, charges for equipment and recoveries from the contractors on account of water and electricity supply. These items are covered by the decision in Bokaro Steel Ltd.'s case 1998 Indlaw SC 1885(SC).
8.  To the extent that it relates to these items, i.e., items excluding interest, the question must be answered in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee. The order under challenge will stand modified to that extent.
Appeal allowed accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
