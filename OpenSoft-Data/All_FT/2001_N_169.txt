Bihar State Credit and Invest.Corpn.Ltd. and Others v Nirmal Kumar Shrivastava
Supreme Court of India

26 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15787/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The order of the Division Bench of Patna High Court is the subject matter of challenge in this appeal by grant of special leave. The sole question for consideration in this case is, whether the High court was justified in coming to the conclusion that the respondent must be deemed to have been confirmed in service.
2.  It is undisputed that the respondent had initially been appointed on temporary basis for a period of one year on 1.9.1986. But, subsequently by order dated 13.12.1991, the petitioner had been informed that he will continue on probation for a period of one year w.e.f. 6.9.1987. He thereafter continued till the order of termination. The High Court under these circumstances came to hold that the continuance of the respondent must be held to be a deemed confirmation.
3.  Under the service rules there is no maximum period of probation provided for and therefore in the absence of any (2) maximum period provided, the status of the respondent would be that of a "probationer", even the period of probation might not have been extended by any order in writing, and therefore, the High Court was in error in conferring a status of "confirmed employee" on the respondent.
4. Since the order of termination is not penal in nature and the respondent continued as a probationer, the impugned judgment must be held to be erroneous. We therefore set aside the impugned judgment and allow this appeal accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
