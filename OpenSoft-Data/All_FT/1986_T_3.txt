State of Andhra Pradesh v T. Nandagopal and Another
Supreme Court of India

8 September 1986
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 10906 of 1986 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 25 April 1986 of the High Court of A. P. at Hyderabad in W.P. M.P. No. 6334 of 1986 in W.P. No. 4597 of 1986)
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Normally, this Court does not interfere with interlocutory orders of this nature except under very exceptional circumstances. In the facts and circumstances of the case, there is no reason for us to depart from this well settled practice. Obviously, the High Court could not have prejudge the whole issue involved in the writ petition which is still to be heard on merits.
2.   We, therefore, made the impugned order subject to the result of the writ petition and without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties. Learned counsel for the State Government seeks two weeks time to implement the impugned order of the High Court. We grant two weeks time to the State Government to implement the direction made by the High Court as prayed for.
3.  We hope and trust that the High Court will endeavour to dispose of the writ petition on merits, as expeditiously as possible; and, in any event, not later than four weeks from today.
Special leave petition is accordingly disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
