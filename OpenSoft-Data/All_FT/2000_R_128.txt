Ram Narayan Singh and Another v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

13 January 2000
Cr.A. No. of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard learned counsel for the appellants and Mr. B.B. Singh, learned counsel for the State of Bihar.
2.  The application for bail during trial having been rejected, the appellants approached this Court. They are facing charges under Sections 406/420/34, Indian Penal Code, 1860 and are in custody for more than nine months by now. The legation is that the appellants misappropriated to the tune of Rs. 75,000/- for giving employment. The earlier order of the High Court was that if the trial does not commence within six months they can renew the prayer for bail.
3.  Having examined the manner in which the trial is proceeding and taking into account the fact that the appellants are already in custody for more than nine months, we think that a case for grant of bail has been made out.
4. We accordingly direct that the appellants be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Katihar.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
