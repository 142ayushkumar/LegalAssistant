V. Radha v Sri Appaiah and Another
Supreme Court of India

20 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8621/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Without entering into the merits and contentions, we dispose of this matter on a short point.
2.  A limited notice was issued in this case as to what would be the rate of interest payable on the amount of decree. There is dispute whether it should be 6% per annum for the delayed payment or 12% per annum. Looking to the totality of the circumstance, we feel it appropriate and accordingly order, the interest payable will be at the rate of 9% on the amount of decree for the said delayed payment.
3. However, this may not be treated as a precedent on the facts of this case. Appeal is partly allowed. Costs on the parties.
4.  Without entering into the merits and contentions, we dispose of this matter by short point.
Appeal partly allowed.
