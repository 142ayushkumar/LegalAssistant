The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. In view of the facts and circumstances of the present case we condone the delay, set aside the abatement of the appeal and direct that the names of the legal representatives of the deceased-respondent 2 Khairati Lal be brought on record, subject to payment of Rs. 1000 as costs to learned counsel for the respondents with in two weeks from today.
2. We condone the delay lest the public interest should suffer, and more particularly because the court has in a very recent decision in Chief Commissioner (now Lt. Governor), Delhi Admn. v. S. Dhanna Singh 1987 Indlaw SC 2889 reversed the judgment of the High Court and upheld the validity of the impugned notifications issued under Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894
3. We are deeply distressed that there should have been such inordinate delay which occurred due to the laches and gross negligence on the part of the concerned officers of the Delhi Administration.

5. The matter is adjourned for ten days.
Order accordingly.
