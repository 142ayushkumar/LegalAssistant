Jagriti Upbhogta Kalyan Parishad and others v U.O.I. and others
Supreme Court of India

13 January 2003
W.P. (Civil) No. 758 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India was filed in public interest, approximately six years earlier, bringing to the notice of this Court how various consumers, distributors and dealers of respondent No. 12-M/s. S.B. Petroleum Ltd. spread in nine States, namely Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Delhi, Punjab were taken for a ride and cheated by collection of crores of rupees. According to the petitioners crores of rupees were syphoned and personal properties acquired. Various orders were passed by this Court from time to time against respondent 12-Company and its Managing Director and his family members and also other Directors. Directions were also issued to various authorities noticing a total inaction on the part of the authorities. Some of the orders passed to which reference can be made in this regard are the orders dated 20th October and 17th November, 1997, 6th February and 20th March, 1998 and 3rd December, 2001. Various bank accounts and properties have been attached. The matter was also investigated by CBI and the Economic Offences Wing (CID) U.P. We have been informed by Shri Altaf Ahmad, learned Additional Solicitor General that 22 chargesheets were filed on 24th December, 1999 before Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate III, Lucknow. Learned Additional Solicitor General submits that primarily on account of the non-cooperation of the accused charges have not been framed. We, however, refrain from expressing any opinion except observing that all concerned are directed to cooperate in the expeditious disposal of the cases that have been initiated as a result of directions issued in this matter.
2.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not think it possible for this Court to either examine from time to time the progress of the criminal cases so as to ensure its expeditious disposal and to also go into the factual details of a large number of consumers and their rights, and also the rights, if any, of dealers/distributors. We may note that though large sums have been refunded, according to respondent no. 12, to the consumers but it seems that still there may be large number of consumers to get the refunds. We feel it would be appropriate, if the matter is transferred to the High Court in terms of the prayer made in I.A. No. 27/2002 filed by the learned Amicus Curiae.
Accordingly, we issue the following directions:
"a) All the case papers of this matter be transferred to High Court of Allahabad with a request to Hon'ble Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court to constitute a special bench either at Allahabad or at Lucknow to deal with the matter.
