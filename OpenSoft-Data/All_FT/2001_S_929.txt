Laxminarayan R. Bhattad and Others v State of Maharashtra and Anr
Supreme Court of India

11 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14140/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Application for exemption from filing c/c of the impugned judgment is ordered.
2.  Leave granted. Printing dispensed with; appeal shall be heard on the S.L.P. paper-book. Additional documents may be filed within four weeks.
3.  We direct the petitioner herein to hand over the possession of old Plot No.433 to the respondent authorities and the respondent authorities are at liberty to develop the same at their convenience. We, however, make it clear that this will not preclude the 2 petitioners from claiming their entitlement to T.D.R. as well as additional T.D.R. rights at the time of the hearing of their appeal.
4. The learned Additional Solicitor General, however, contends that the claim for additional T.D.R. rights are being raised for the first time and they should not be allowed to raise the same. We leave this contention open and it will be considered at the stage of final hearing of the appeal.
Hearing of the appeal expedited.
Order accordingly.
