Commissioner of Central Excise, Jaipur v Rural Engineering Company Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

13 April 2005
C.A. Nos. 6064-6065 of 1999 (Arising From Cegat's Final Order Nos. 1082-1083/99-A, Dt. 3.8.99),
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These Appeals are against the Judgment of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (in short "CEGAT"), New Delhi, dated 3rd August, 1999.
2.  The question is, whether the interest accrued on advances taken from the customers is to be included in the value of the goods supplied? Very fairly it is admitted that there is no proof that taking of the advances had any influence in reducing the price or that the advances taken were used as a working capital.
3. This case is, therefore, covered by the ratio laid down by this Court in the case of Metal Box India Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, Madras reported in 1995 Indlaw SC 17511995 Indlaw SC 1751.
4.  In these circumstances, we see no reason to interfere. The Appeals stand dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
