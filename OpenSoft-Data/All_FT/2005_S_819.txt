New India Assurance Company Limited v Sudhanshu Mohan Satpathy
Supreme Court of India

16 September 2005
C.A. No. 5778 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 22130 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard parties.
1.  This appeal is against an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi by which a delay of 75 days, in filing the revision petition, has not been condoned and the revision petition has been dismissed. In our view, the delay should have been condoned.
2. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order, condone the delay and remit the revision petition back to the National Commission for disposal on merits. The appellant shall pay to the respondent cost fixed at Rs.5000 within four weeks from today. The National Commission shall intimate the next date of hearing to both the parties.
The civil appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
