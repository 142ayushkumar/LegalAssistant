A. C. Narayanan v State of Maharashtra and another
Supreme Court of India

10 November 2008
CRL.M.P. No. 12258/2008 and Criminal Appeal No. 73/2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. It is stated in paragraph 5 of the application for restoration:
"That it is most humbly submitted that the request for filing the Additional Documents had been inadvertently made by a junior in the office of the Advocate on Record. It is most respectfully submitted that no additional documents are required to be filed, and the said Junior Advocate misunderstood the instructions and erroneously made the request."
2. It is difficult for us to really appreciate as to how any Advocate of this Court can make a representation before us that additional documents are required to be filed and then we are informed that such additional documents are not necessary. We hope that for the purpose of taking adjournment, such a practice is not resorted to.
3. However, as it is stated by Ms. Malhotra, learned senior counsel that no further additional documents are required to be filed, the order dated 6.5.2008 is recalled and the application for restoration is allowed.
Application allowed
