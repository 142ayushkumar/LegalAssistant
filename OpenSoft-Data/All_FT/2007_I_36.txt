1.  Heard Mr.G.Bikshapathy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and Mr.Sanjay Bhatt, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the contesting respondent No.1 (Industrial Dev.Bank of India Ltd.).
2.  This appeal was filed against the order passed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dt.27.04.2006 in W.P.No.7951 of 2006 and W.P.M.P.No.10172 of 2006. The High Court was approached by the first respondent herein against the direction given by the A.P.State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directing release of security to the appellant herein. The High Court stayed the operation of the order dt.06.04.2006 passed by the A.P.State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Hyderabad in CDIA No.33/2006 (CD No.1/2006). When the matter came up for admission before this Court on 19.06.2006, this Court passed the following Order :-
"Issue notice returnable within six weeks.
In the meanwhile, the operation of the impugned order passed by the High Court in WPMP No. 10172/2006 in WP No.7951/2006 dt.27.04.2006 shall remain stayed.
In the meantime, either the principal debtor or the guarantor are at liberty to deposit the money with the bank so that this Court may consider the prayer for return of share certificates and title documents to the petitioner- guarantor. This direction is issued since the GTL is ready to pay the outstanding principal amount of Rs.4.80 crores along with 9% interest per annum from December, 2003."

5.  It is thus seen that in compliance of the Order of this Court dt.19.06.2006, the guarantor deposited the money with the first respondent. Since the sum of Rs.54,22,237/- (Rupees fifty four lakh twenty two thousand two hundred thirty seven only) has been paid by the appellant to the first respondent bank towards full and final settlement of the dues of IDBI, the IDBI has requested the appellant herein to withdraw the cases pending before the A.P.State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Hyderabad and in this Court to enable them to release the securities at the earliest.
6. In view of the payment of Rs.54,22,237/- made by the appellant towards full and final settlement of the dues of IDBI, the said bank is directed to release the securities to respondent No.3 (Goldstone Technologies Ltd.) forthwith. In view of the final payment now received by IDBI, there is nothing further survives for the bank to pursue the Writ Petition No.7951/2006 filed by them before the High Court. Therefore, the IDBI is directed to withdraw the said Writ Petition from the High Court. Likewise, the appellant is also directed to withdraw the case filed by them before the A.P.State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Hyderabad immediately. The zerox copies of the letter dt.01.02.2007 and 03.02.2007 are placed on record and will form part of this Order.

The appeal stands disposed of accordingly. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
