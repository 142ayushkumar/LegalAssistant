State of Uttar Pradesh and Others v Messrs U.G.S. and Industries Limited and Anr
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.5220/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we are of the view that it will be in the interest of justice if the judgment of the High Court is set aside for the simple reason that the contentions raised by the appellants herein have neither been considered nor dealt with by the High Court.
2. We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and restore Writ Petition No. 906/1995 on the board of the High Court.
Appeal allowed.
