Deepak Kumar Jaiswal v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

5 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.)....../2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  The petitioner was arrested in connection with an offence under Section 135 of the Customs Act. The arrest was made on 13.6.2000. Initially we were inclined to entertain this SLP as the petitioner was languishing in the jail for more than six months as an under trial prisoner. But we have now noticed that the High Court permitted the petitioner to move the High Court again after six months and now that six months period is over.
2. If the petitioner approaches the High Court we have no reason to think that an appropriate order would not be passed by the High Court. That will be more convenient for the petitioner also, instead of coming to this Court.
3.Without prejudices to his right to move the High Court as observed by the High Court in the impugned order we dispose of this SLP.
Petition disposed of.
