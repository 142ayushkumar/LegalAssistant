The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner is the wife of the respondent. The respondent has filed a matrimonial suit being HMA No. 748 of 2000, titled Rabi Shankar Mukherjee v. Leena Mukherjee in the Court of the learned Additional District Judge, Delhi. The petitioner is a resident of Durgapur, District Burdwan, West Bengal.
