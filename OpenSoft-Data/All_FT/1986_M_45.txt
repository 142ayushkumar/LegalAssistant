Managing Committee, R. S. Khalsa High School, Ludhiana v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 September 1986
C.A. No. 3027 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we allow the appeal insofar that we direct the management to take the respondent, Kamikkar Singh Kallay, back into service with effect from the date on which he presents himself before the management for that purpose and to appoint him to a post aided by the State Government. We further direct that the respondent, Kamikkar Singh Kallay, will be entitled to back wages from February 17, 1977, for that period only during which he was available for service in the R. S. Khalsa High School and was not employed or occupied elsewhere. The computation of that period shall be made by the District Educational Officer Ludhiana, who will permit the parties to produce evidence in that behalf and hear them on such evidence before making his order. The arrears of back wages so computed will be paid by the school but will be the liability of the State Government.
2.   We make it clear that the appointment of the new employee in place of the said Kamikkar Singh Kallay with effect from November 17, 1977, shall remain undistributed.
3.  The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There is no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
