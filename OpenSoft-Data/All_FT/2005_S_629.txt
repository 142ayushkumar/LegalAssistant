State of Punjab and others v Babita Kumari
Supreme Court of India

20 April 2005
C.A. No. 7935 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 23-5-2002, in CWP No.8120 of 2002, of the Punjab and Haryana High Court challenging the award made by the Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Gurdaspur whereby the Labour Court directed the reinstatement of the respondent with full back wages on the ground that the respondent had completed 240 days of continuous service in the given year.
2. This finding of the Labour Court is based on material that was placed before it and also on the basis of the fact that the material which could have rebutted the claim of the respondent was not produced by the appellant even though the same was available with it. That being the case, in our opinion, the High Court was justified in dismissing the challenge to the award and confirming the same.
3.  We find no error to interfere in this appeal. The appeal fails and the same is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
