There is a finding of the revisional court that the petitioners have failed to deposit the amount as was required under Section 20(4) of the Act and therefore, they have incurred the liability to ejectment. I have scrutinized the finding of fact that the petitioners have infact committed default in payment of arrears of rent, therefore, liable to be evicted"
The Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
