Orma Impex Private Limited v Nissai Asb Pte. Limited
Supreme Court of India

19 August 1998
S.L.P. (C) No. 12788 of 1998 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 12 February 1998 in FAO No. 57 of 1997 of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi)
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  In this case, the High Court has taken the view that no further appeal would lie u/s. 50 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") against an order u/s. 45 refusing to refer parties to arbitration as passed by learned Single Judge.
2. Therefore, the view seems to be that unless the Act expressly provides for appeal against the decision of the learned Single Judge exercising powers u/s. 45 of the Act, no appeal would lie to the Division Bench. Unfortunately, S. 10 of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966 and cl. 10 of the Letters Patent which apply to the High Court of Delhi have not been noticed therein.
3.  However, there is a two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in State of W. B. v. Gourangalal Chatterjee  1993 Indlaw SC 1693  which supports the view taken by the High Court in the impugned judgment. In State of W.B. v. Gourangalal Chatterjee 1993 Indlaw SC 1693 this Court relied upon an earlier decision of the Court in Union of India v. Mohindra Supply Co. 1961 Indlaw SC 3391961 Indlaw SC 339. The said decision was rendered with reference to the appealability of an order passed by the High Court in an appeal from the order of the subordinate court and not from the order passed by a learned Single Judge sitting on the Original Side of the High Court. There is also another decision of a two-judge Bench of this Court in Vinita M. Khanolkar v. Pragna M. Pai  1997 Indlaw SC 17261997 Indlaw SC 1726 which appears to have taken a contrary view relying upon cl. 15 of the Letter Patent applicable to the High Court of Bombay. Thus, there appears to be conflict of decisions on this question.
4.  Even that apart, as early as in 1953, a three-Judge Bench of this Court in National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. v. James Chadwick and Bros. Ltd. 1953 Indlaw SC 94  especially in a para thereof, held that when a question is stated to be referred to an established court, without more, the ordinary incidents of the procedure of that court will get attached including right of appeal from its decision and accordingly, cl. 15 of the Letters Patent was held applicable to decisions rendered by learned Single Judges of the High Court exercising jurisdiction under the Trade Marks Act, even though under the said Act, no appeal was provided.
5.  It is, therefore, appropriate to direct this special leave petition to be placed before a Bench of three Judges of this Court. The office may obtain appropriate order from Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India in this connection.
