Union of India and Others v Kalpana Sharma
Supreme Court of India

11 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19703/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the proceedings of contempt initiated in the present case were clearly uncalled for. The High Court ought not to have by an interim order directed compassionate appointment of the respondent when that was the very relief which she was seeking in the writ petition itself. The proper course of action would have been to dispose of the writ petition expeditiously and not to give the direction which it did.
2. We further notice that in the order dated 8th July, 1999, the High Court had directed that the respondents should consider the case of appointment of the writ petitioner, but that cannot then be extended to give a direction to give her employment and thereby foreclosing the consideration.
3.  We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the impugned order dated 17th October, 2000 and direct the High Court to dispose of the main writ petition filed by the respondent within a period of six months if possible. It will be open to the parties to raise such contentions as may be available to them in accordance with law.
Appeal allowed.
