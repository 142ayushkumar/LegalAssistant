Birla Institute of Technology v Jaya Shree and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 August 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO.1949 OF 2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  The question involved in this case is one relating to admission of a student to the appellant institute. The contention put forth on behalf of the appellant is that there was some reservation in favour of the candidates who are children of the members of the staff of the institute and inasmuch as the respondent's brother had already been provided with a seat in the institute that for the second time such a facility could not be given to the respondent.
2. However, the High Court did not agree with that contention and directed admission of the respondent(Jaya Shree).
3.  When the matter was brought up before us while directing issue of notice we granted interim stay of the operation of the impugned order of the High Court. Thus the respondent was unable to get admission in the institute. In the circumstances, as the course is now coming to an end this year no useful purpose will be served by reexamining the various questions that were adjudicated before the High Court. Suffice to say, the questions arising in this matter are kept open for consideration in an appropriate case.
The appeal therefore stands disposed of as having become infructuous.
Appeal disposed of.
