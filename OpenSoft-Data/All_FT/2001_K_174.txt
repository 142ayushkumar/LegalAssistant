R. Saraswathi Amma v Kerala Financial Corporation and Anr
Supreme Court of India

30 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11875/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In the impugned order after noticing the contentions raised by the petitioner, the Division Bench observed that the remedy of the petitioner to have the record correct was to file a review petition before the learned Single Judge and that the appeal is not the remedy under circumstances. That view is indeed correct.
2. We, therefore, while dismissing the special leave petition clarify that the dismissal of the appeal by the Division Bench shall not come in the way of the learned Single Judge to decide the review petition, if filed, on its own merits.
The special leave petition is dismissed with the above observations.
Petition dismissed.
