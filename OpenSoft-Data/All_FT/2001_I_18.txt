State of Punjab and Others v Inderjit Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6940/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petition stated that the matter might be disposed of at the S.L.P. stage by setting aside the orders of the High Court and restoring the appeal to be heard and disposed of on merits, regardless of any technicalities.
2.  Having heard learned counsel, we think that that is the appropriate order to pass. Needless to say, it will be open to the respondents herein to rely upon the orders of this court, which shall be considered by the High Court in passing the final orders.
3. Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed. The delay of 71 days in filing the appeal before the High Court is condoned. The appeal before the High Court (L.P.A. No.295 of 1998) is restored to its file to be heard and disposed of on merits. This shall be done expeditiously.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
