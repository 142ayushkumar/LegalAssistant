He also submits that the petitioner is not cooperating with the visitation rights given to the respondent for the child Rs. Shubhan'.
4. The petitioner submits that she has no objection if the respondent-father takes the child as per the order of the Court on every Sunday for three hours. She is only worried that the child is not getting proper attention.
5. The respondent-father assures that he will take proper care of the child. Therefore, while allowing this transfer petition, it is made clear that petitioner shall cooperate with the order for taking the minor child every Sunday for three hours.

He also assures that he will always be in the company of the child.
