Girija M.V. and Others v State of Kerala and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16729-16730/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In the special features of these cases we think it would be proper for the respondents to extend the benefit of the order given by this Court in W.P.(C) No.493/91 in the order made on 9.5.1995 in as much as they are all qualified for the post of Junior Public Health Nurse. This order shall not be treated as precedent to be applicable to others.
2. In the event that services of any of the candidates/petitioners have been terminated during the pendency of the proceedings before this Court, though no salary need be paid to them for that period, they shall be given benefit of continuity of service in the matter of regularisation.
3.  The civil appeals are allowed accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
