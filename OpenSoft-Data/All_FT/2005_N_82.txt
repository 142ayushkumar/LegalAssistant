Neelam Kumari v Navinder Singh
Supreme Court of India

7 January 2005
Transfer Petition (C) No. 535 of 2004

Heard parties.
1.  This is the wife's petition for transfer of HMA No. 1012 of 2003 titled Navinder Singh v. Neelam Kumari from the Court of District Judge, Delhi to any competent court at Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh on the ground that she is financially incapable of bearing the cost of litigation in Delhi and she has no place to stay in Delhi. It is also stated that she has a small son whom she cannot leave alone. It is opposed on the ground that mere inconvenience of the petitioner wife is not sufficient for transfer.
2. In our view, grounds made out by the petitioner are adequate to direct a transfer.
3.  We, therefore, allow the transfer petition. HMA No. 1012 of 2003 is transferred from the Court of District Judge, Delhi to any competent court at Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh.
Petition allowed.
