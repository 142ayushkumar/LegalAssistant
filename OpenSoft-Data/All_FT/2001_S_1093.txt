Tayyab Hussain v State of Rajasthan and Anr
Supreme Court of India

23 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20340/2000
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is stated by learned counsel for the petitioner that there are documents which clearly show that the degree in Urdu, which the petitioner had obtained from Aligarh had been recognised by the State of Rajasthan. The High Court has proceeded on the basis that as the petitioner did not have Urdu as a subject in the Secondary School Examination, he was not qualified.
2. Case of the petitioner is that he had passed the examination equivalent to B.A. in Urdu and that was recognised. This requires investigation of fact.
3.  If review application is filed by the petitioner before the Division Bench within one month from today the High Court will deal with the same.
With these observations, the special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
