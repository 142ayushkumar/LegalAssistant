Bharat Chemicals Industries v State of Uttar Pradesh and others
Supreme Court of India

18 July 2001
C.A. No. 703 of 1981
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this appeal by special leave the core issue is a sequel to the decision of a seven-Judge Constitution Bench in Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of U.P. 1989 Indlaw SC 286 Subsequently, it appears that contrary views were expressed by different Benches of this Court as to whether money, which had not been recovered in respect of the period prior to 25-10-1989 could be recovered thereafter.
2. The matter has now been set at rest by a Constitution Bench in Somaiya Organics (India) Ltd. v. State of U.P. 2001 Indlaw SC 462 Learned counsel for the parties are agreed that the reasoning of the judgment and the conclusions arrived at therein by the Constitution Bench apply to this case.
3.  Therefore, we allow this appeal in terms of the judgment in Somaiya Organics case 2001 Indlaw SC 462 (supra). The reasoning and conclusions of that judgment shall apply to this case.
4.  As a consequence, the bank guarantee shall stand discharged and the appellant shall have the liberty to proceed in accordance with law. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
