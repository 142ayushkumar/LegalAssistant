1. Leave granted.
2. Learned counsel appearing for Respondent No.1, who is the Election Petitioner, submits that leaving the question of law open this appeal can be disposed of, since Respondent No.1 is willing to present himself for examination and cross examination. It is further submitted that this submission is made since the election petition has been pending for the last three years and for one reason or the other the same is getting adjourned by the appellant.
3. In view of the above, this appeal is disposed of with a direction to the Election Tribunal to dispose of the Election Petition No.02 of 2014 expeditiously, preferably within a period of three months from the next date of posting, when Respondent No.1 shall make himself available for examination.
4. We make it clear that we have not considered the merits of the case and the question of law is kept open.
5. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
6. There shall be no orders as to costs.
Order accordingly
