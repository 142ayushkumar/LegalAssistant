Roopa Ram v State of Rajasthan
Supreme Court of India

9 October 1998
Cr.A. No. 1066 of 1998 (arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 768 of 1998), Dt. 9 October 1998.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Leave granted limited to the nature of offence. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
2.  The appellant and two others were tried for committing the murder of one Naba in furtherance of their common intention. The trial Court convicted the appellant under Section 302, I.P.C. and acquitted the other two. As the appeal preferred by him in the High Court proved abortive, he has filed the instant appeal.
3.  In absence of any conclusive evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove that the injury inflicted by the appellant resulted in the death of the victim, the appellant could not be - in view of the acquittal of the other two against whom the allegation was that they also inflicted injuries on the deceased - convicted under Section 302, I.P.C. as he would be liable only for his own act, which in the instant case was of causing a grievous injury on the head of the deceased by a 'kudali' (a sharp cutting instrument).
4. The offence committed by the appellant will, therefore, come squarely under Section 326, I.P.C. We accordingly set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant under Section 302, I.P.C. and convict him under Section 326, I.P.C. For the altered conviction we sentence him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 7 years.
The appeal is thus allowed.
Appeal allowed.
