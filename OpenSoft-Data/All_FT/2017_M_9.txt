M. C. Mehta v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

17 November 2017
Writ Petitions (Civil) Nos. 13029/1985
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. On 13.11.2017, we had reserved orders on various applications filed for recall of the order dated 24.10.2017 regarding the ban on use of furnace oil and pet coke in the States of U.P., Haryana and Rajasthan.
2. Today, the learned ASG has placed before us a decision taken by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change of the Government of India on 15.11.2017 requiring the Central Pollution Control Board to issue a direction under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 to the States of U.P., Haryana and Rajasthan prohibiting any industry, operation or processes using pet coke and furnace oil as fuel with immediate effect until further orders. It is clarified by the learned ASG that this is with respect to entire State and not only NCR region.
3. Pursuant to the communication dated 15.11.2017, a direction has been issued on the same date i.e. 15.11.2017 by the Chairman, CPCB under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The direction is to the effect that there will be a prohibition on the use of pet coke and furnace oil by any industry, operation or processes within the the States of U.P., Haryana and Rajasthan with immediate effect until further orders.
4. It is submitted by the learned Amicus that a prohibition on the use of pet coke and furnace oil will solve only a part of the problem. A direction should also be issued to the effect there is a ban on the sale of pet coke and furnace oil in all these three States for being used as fuel.
5. The learned ASG says that he will look into the matter and will get back to us within a week or so.
6. We may note that pollution caused by pet coke and furnace oil is not a problem confined only to the NCR region but appears to be a problem faced by almost all the States and Union Territories in the country.
7. For the present, we do not propose to give any direction to any other State and Union Territory but we request all the State Governments and Union Territories to consider taking similar measures as have been taken by the Government of India and the Chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
