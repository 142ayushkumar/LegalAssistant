Collector Of Central Excise, Vadodara v Dhiren Chemical Industries
Supreme Court of India

21 February 2002
C.A. No. 7937 of 1995 with C.A. Nos. 2496-2497 of 1992
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The issue involved in these appeals is covered by the decision of a Constitution Bench in Collector of Central Excise, Vadodara v. Dhiren Chemical Industries 2001 Indlaw SC 21373. The Constitution Bench interpreted the phrase "on which the appropriate amount of duty of excise has already been paid" in favour of the Revenue.
2. However, it held that, regardless of the interpretation placed by it on that phrase, if there were circulars which had been issued by the Central Board of Excise and Customs which placed a different interpretation upon that phrase, that interpretation would be binding on the Revenue. It is not disputed that there are circulars issued by the Central Board of Excise and Customs which place a different interpretation upon that phrase and which apply to the facts of these two appeals. For that reason these appeals are dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
