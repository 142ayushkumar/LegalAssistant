U.P. Public Service Commission and Another v Praveen Shukla
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20355/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Notwithstanding due service of notice, the respondent has not appeared. The Service Commission is in appeal against the impugned order of the High Court. Under the rules of Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission, a candidate is required to give his date of birth in the application form, and it is clearly stipulated that the Commission is not bound to entertain an incomplete application form. A combined preliminary examination was held for selecting suitable candidates for entry into the U.P. Secretariat/U.P. Public Service Commission, and the respondent was one of the applicants. As his application was found to be lacking of the necessary particulars, the same was not entertained. He having approached the High Court, the High Court by the impugned judgment directed that he may be permitted to appear at the examination. That order, however, has been stayed.
2. It is contended on behalf of the appellant that in view of the specific provision contained in the Rules, and the material particulars have been lacking, the Commission was wholly justified in not entertaining the application of the respondent, and the High Court was in error in directing that the said respondent should be allowed to appear at the examination. We find sufficient force in the contention. The High Court also appears to have disposed of the matter without even noticing the Public Service Commission. The impugned order of the High Court is wholly unreasonable and contrary to the relevant provisions of the Rules. The said order is accordingly set aside, and the appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
