Rajasthan Transformers Manufacturing Asson. and v Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut P. Nigam Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10789/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  Admittedly, the writ petition filed by the petitioner is still pending in the High Court. We are not inclined to interfere with an interim order of vacating an order of stay on 16th February, 2001. The special leave petition is, therefore, dismissed.
2.  We, however, request the High Court, in view of the peculiar nature of the controversy raised, to dispose of the writ petition expeditiously uninfluenced by any observations made while granting or refusing stay or the dismissal of this special leave petition.
3.  Interim order dated 2nd July, 2001, granted by this Court, shall stand vacated.
Petition dismissed.
