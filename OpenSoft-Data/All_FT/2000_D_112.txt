St. Stephen's Teacher Training Institute v Director of Government Examinations, Tamil Nadu
Supreme Court of India

6 December 2000
C.A. No.4963 of 1999AA
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have no doubt whatsoever, having heard learned counsel for the appellant, that the appellant obtained the order in respect of which it filed the contempt proceedings by concealment of the fact that in an earlier writ petition it had obtained a similar order and that similar order had stood vacated when that writ petition was dismissed. There has been an attempt to interfere with the course of justice.
2.  At the very least, therefore, this appeal must be dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
