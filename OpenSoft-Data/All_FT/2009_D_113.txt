6 February 2009
Civil Appeal No. 807 of 2009 (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 7854/2007) with Civil Appeal No.808 of 2009 (@ SLP(C) No. 7855/2007) with Civil Appeal No.809 of 2009 (@ SLP(C) No. 7856/2007) with Civil Appeal No.810 of 2009 (@ SLP(C) No. 7857/2007) with Civil Appeal No. 811 of 2009 (@ SLP(C) No. 7858/2007)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  These appeals by special leave are directed against common judgment and final order dated 14.9.2006 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Civil Writ Petition Nos.2145/2005, 19408/2004, 3450/2005, 3456/2005 and 11581/2006, by which the High Court has directed to pay full back wages to the workmen. Having heard learned counsel appearing for the parties and after going through the materials on record and considering the fact that the respondents have already been reinstated in the service, we are of the view that the interest of justice would be met if instead of full back wages, 30 per cent of the back wages be paid. We accordingly modify the impugned order of the High Court to that extent and dispose of the appeals with no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of
