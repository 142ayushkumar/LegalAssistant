Sher-E-Punjab Silk Stores v Commissioner of Income Tax, New Delhi
Supreme Court of India

11 December 1972
C.A. No. 1690 of 1969
The Judgment was delivered by: K. S. Hegde, J.
1. This is an appeal by special leave. The appellant is the assesssee. In this case we are concerned with his assessment for the assessment year 1958-59. The relevant previous year ended on March 31, 1958. The assesses firm applied for renewal of its registration u/s. 26(A) of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922 (in short 'the Act') before the Income-Tax Officer on May 26, 1958. In that application he mentioned that the previous years' income had been divided among the partners. The Income-Tax Officer rejected that application. He did not believe the version of the assessee that the previous years' income had been divided. In appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner agreed with the conclusion reached by the Income-tax Officer. On a further appeal being taken to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal the Tribunal agreed with the conclusions reached by the lower authorities. Before the Tribunal yet another contention appears to have been taken. That contention was that at any rate the partners having divided the income of the previous year as evidenced by the balance sheet before the assessment Was made, the assessee firm was entitled for its registration u/s. 26(A). The Tribunal did not go into that question. The High Court agreed with the view taken by the Tribunal.
2. The only question that arises for decision in this case is whether it was incumbent on the part of the assessee to have divided the profits of the previous year before it made its application for renewal of the registration certificate. For deciding this question it is necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act as well as the Rules. S. 26 (A) of the Act reads, thus.-
"26A. Procedure in registration of firms
(1)Application may be made to the Income-tax Officer on behalf of any firm, constituted under an instrument of partnership specifying the individual shares of the partners, for registration for the purposes of this Act and of any other enactment for the time being in force relating to income-tax or super tax.
(2)The application shall be made by such person or persons, and at such times and small contain such particulars and shall be in such form, and be verified in such manner, as may be prescribed; and it shall be dealt with by the income-tax Officer in such manner as may be prescribed."
3. Turning to the relevant Rules, they are found in Rules 2, 3 and 6. These Rules read thus:--
"Rule 2-Any firm constituted under an Instrument of Partnership specifying the individual shares of the partners may, under the provisions of section 26A of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter in these rules referred to as the Act), register with the Income tax Officer, the particulars contained in the said Instrument on application made in this behalf.

The Income-tax Officer
Assessment for the Income-tax Year 19/19
3. We do hereby further certify that the profits (or loss if any) of the previous year were/period up to the date of dissolution were/will be divided or credited as shown below:-

(2) If any partner is entitled his share in column 6 the letter "P".
Note :-This application must be signed personally of any such person who is deceased".
10. From a reading of these provisions it is clear that in the case of an application for renewal it is incumbent on the part of the assessee to have divided the previous year's profits. This conclusion appears to be obvious from S. 26(A) read with Rules 2, 3, 6 and the forms set out earlier. The contention of Mr. Sharma, the learned counsel for the assessee, that if the relevant provisions are interpreted in the manner that we have done it leads to hardship to the assessee, is not relevant in view of the plain language of the provisions.
11. Our conclusion in this regard receives support from the decision of Madras High Court in Surajmall v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras, (43 I.T.R. 491 1960 Indlaw MAD 57), and that of the Allahabad High Court in Ganesh Lal Laxmi Narain v. Commissioner of Income-tax, U.P.,( 68 I.T.R. 696 1967 Indlaw ALL 58). In Khanjan Lal Sewak Ram v. Commissioner of Income- tax, U.P., (83 I.T.R. 175 1971 Indlaw SC 414) this Court had ruled that para 3 of Rule 6 (supra) is mandatory. We see no merit in this appeal. It is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dimissed.
