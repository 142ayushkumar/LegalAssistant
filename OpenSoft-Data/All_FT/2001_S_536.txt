Prafulla Kumar Satsangi v State of Bihar and Anr
Supreme Court of India

27 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2464/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have no reason to think that offences involved in these cases are of such a nature as would dis-entitle the appellants from the discretionary order envisaged under Section 438 of the Cr. P.C.
2. We, therefore, direct that the appellants, if arrested, shall be released on bail by the arresting officer on executing a bond each for such amount as the officer may fix with two solvent sureties to his satisfaction.
These appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
