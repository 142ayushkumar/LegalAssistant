Supreme Court of India

13  May  1993
Writ Petition (c) No. 715 of 1990
The Judgment was delivered by: R. M. Sahai, J.
Imams,incharge of religious activities of the mosque'
(1) have approached this court by way of this, representative, petition u/art. 32 of the
1.  Constitution for enforcement of fundamental right against their exploitation by Wakf Boards. Relief sought is direction to Central and State Wakf Boards to treat the petitioner as employees of the Board and to pay them basic wages to enable them to survive. Basis of claim is glaring disparity between the nature of work and amount of remuneration. Higher pay scale isclaimed for degree holders. Imams perform the duty of offering prayer(Namaz) for congregation in mosques. 'Essentially the mosque is a centre of community worship where Muslims perform ritual prayers and where historically they have also gathered for political, social and cultural functions'.
(2) The functions of the mosque is summarised by the 13th Century jurist Ibn Taymiyah 'as a. place of fathering where prayer was celebrated and when public affairs were conducted'.
(3) 'All mosques are where Muslim men on an equalitarian basis rich or poor, noble or humble, stand in rows to perform their prayers behind the imam
(4) Imams are expected to look after the cleanliness of mosque, call azans from the balcony of the minarets to the whole religious meetings and propagate the Islamic faith. They are expected to be well versed in the Shariat, the holy Quran, the Hadiths, ethics, philosophy, social, economic and religious aspects. "Imam or prayer leader is the most important appointee. In the early days the ruler himself filled this role; he was leader (imam) of the government of war, and of the common salat ("ritual prayer"). Under the Abbasids, when the caliph no longer conducted prayers on a regular basis, a paid imam was appointed. While any prominent or learned Muslim can have the honor of leading prayers,each mosque specifically appoints a man well versed in theological matters to act as its imam. He is in charge of the religious activities of the mosque, and it is his duty to conduct prayers five times a day in front of Mihyab'.
(5) On nature of the duties performed by the imams there is no dispute. But both the Union of India and various State Wakf Boards of different States which have put in appearance in response to the notice issued by this Court have seriously disputed the manner of their appointment, right to receive any payment and absence of any relationship of master and servant. It is stated that the imams or muazzins are appointed by the Mutwallis. According to them the Wakf Boards have nothing to do either with their, appointment or working. It is claimed that under lslamic religious practice they are not entitled to any emoluments as a matter of right as the Islamic law ordains the imams to offer voluntary service. They are said to be paid some money out of the donations received in mosques or by the Mutwallis of the Boards. Their job is stated to be honorary and not paid.Natureof duty under Islamic Sharjat is stated to lead prayers which is performed voluntarily by any suitable Muslim without any monetary benefit. Some of the affidavits claim that they are appointed by people of the locality.
2.   The Union Government has specifically stated that the Islam does not recognise the concept of priesthood as in other religions and the selection of imams is the sole prerogative of the members of the local community or the managing committee, if any, of the mosque. According to Karnataka Wakf Board Imamate in the mosque is not considered to be employment. The allegation of the petitioners that due to meagre payment they are humiliated or insulted in the society, is denied and it is claimed that they are respectable persons who carry on the duty of Imamate as a part of religious activity and not for earning bread and butter. The Delhi Wakf Board pointed out that the honorarium is paid to an imam as a consideration for his five time presence in the mosque regularly and punctually. The Board has denied any right to exercise an authority over the mosque where imams and muazzins are appointed by the mutwallis or by the managing committees. It is stated that holding of a certificate from a registered institution to enablea person to lead the prayer is not necessary as the only requirement for being an imam under the Sharjat is to (1) to (5).
3.  The Encyclopaedia of Religion Vol. 10 p- 121-122 have a thorough knowledge of the holy Quaran and the rites, rulesand obligations required for offering prayers according to the principles laid down by the Kuran and Sunnah. The affidavit filed on behalf of Wakf Board has pointed out that mosque can be categorised infive categories, one, which areunder direct control or management ofthe Government such as Mecca Masjid or the mosque situated in public garden which are not governed or regulated by the Muslim Wakf Board', second, mosques which are under the direct management of Wakf Board-, third, mosques whichare under the controlof mutwallis under various Wakfs according to the wishes of the Wakf as the creator of the Wakf, fourth, mosques which are not registered with the Wakf Board and are managed by local inhabitants and are under the management of the public who offer prayers regularly in a particular mosque-, and fifth, mosques which are not managed by mutwallis or the Muslin-is of the locality. It is claimed that imams of fourth and fifth category are not regular and any Muslim can lead the prayers, whereas under the third category mosques are having regular imams. Financial difficulty of the Wakf Board to meet the demand has also been pointed out.
4.   The Pondicherry Wakf Board has pointed that there is not even one employee excepta peon working therein and, therefore, it is not possible to meet the demand of the imam. It is also claimed that the Board has no control over the peshimams as they are considered to be well dignified personality of the society and they are given due respect by the Muslim community as a whole. In the counter-affidavit filed by the Punjab Wakf Board it has been stated that imams of mosques in Punjab were being paid on basis of their qualification. Imam: Nazara (Muntaii grade) are in the scale of Rs. 380-20- 58O25-830-30-980, whereas Imams Hafiz (Wasti grade),are paid Rs. 445-20-645-25895-30-1045, and Imam Alim (Muntaii grade) are paid Rs. 520-20-720-25-97030-1120. They are also paid Rs.30 per month medical allowance and muazzins are paid Rs. 310 per month. These scales were revised in 1992. According to them imams of all the mosques in Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh which come under the Punjab Wakf Board are being paid regularly and they are treated as regular employees. The Sunni Central Wakf Board of 'Uttar Pradesh filed only a Written submission stating that all the sunni mosqueswere managed by mutwallis of the concerned managing committees and not by the Wakf Board.
5.   The mosque differs from a church or a temple inmany respects.Ceremonies and service connected with marriages and birth are never performed in mosques.Tile rites that are important and integral functions of many churches such as confessions, penitencies and confirmations do not exist in the mosques. (6) Nor any offerings are made as is common in Hindu temples.'In Muslims countries mosques are subsidized by the States, hence no collectionof money from the community is permitted. The Ministry of Wakf(Endowments) appoints the servant, preachers and readers of the Koran. Mosques in non-Muslim countries are subsidised by individuals.They are administered by their founder or by their special fund. A caretaker is appointed to keep the placeclean. 5. The muazzin cells to prayer five times a day from the minaret. (7) In our country in 1954 Wakf Actwas passed by the Parliament for better administrationand supervision of Wakfs. To achieve the objective ofthe Act S. 9 provides for establishment of a Wakf Board the functions of which are detailed in S. 15. Sub-s. (1) of it reads as under
"(1) Subject to any rules that may bemade under this Act, the (general superintendence of all wakfs in State in relation to all matters,exceptthose which are expressly requiredby this Act to be dealt with by the Wakf Commissioner, shall vest) in the Boar d established for the State; and it shall be the duty of the Board so to exercise its powers under this Act as to ensure that the Wakfs under its superintendence are properly maintained controlled and administered and the income thereof is duly applied to the objects and for the purposes for the objects and for the purposes for which such wakfs were created or intended:
Providedthat in exercising its powers under this Act in respect of any wakf, the Board shall act in conformity with the directions of the Wakf, the purposes of the wakf and any usage or custom of the wakf sanctioned by the Muslim law".
6.  Cl. (b) of Sub-section (2)obliges the board "to ensure that the income and other property of a wakf are applied to the objects and for the purposes for which that wakf was created or intended".
7.   The board is vested not only with supervisory and administrative powers over the wakfs but even the financial power vests in it. One of its primary duties is to ensure that the income from the wakf is spent on carrying out the purposes for which wakf was created.
8.   Mosques are wakfs and are required to be registered under the Act over which the board exercises control. Purpose of their creation is community, worship. Namaz or Salat is the mandatory practice observed in every mosque.."(Among the Five Pillars (arkan;so., rukn) of Islam, it holds the second most import,position, immediately after the declaration of faith (shahadah) (8). The (6) & (7) Encyclopedia, Britannica Vol. 18 P. 883 (8) The Encyclopedia of Religion Vol. 13 P. 20-21 principal functionaryto undertake it is the Imam. The objective andpurpose of every mosque being community worship and it being the obligation of board under the Act to ensure that the objective of the wakf is carried on the Board cannot escape from its responsibility for proper maintenance of religious service in a mosque. Tosay, therefore, that the Board has no control over the mosque or Imam is not correct. Absence of any provision in the Act or the rules providing for appointment of Imam or layingdown condition of their service is probably because they are not considered asemployees. At the same time it cannot be disputed that due to change in social and economic set-up they too need sustenance. Nature of their job issuch that,they may be required to be present in the mosque nearly for the whole day. There may be some who mayperform the duty as part of their religious observance. Still others may be ordained by the community to do so. But there are large number of such persons who have no other occupation or profession or service for their livelihood except doing duty as Imam. What should be their fate? Should they bepaid any remuneration and if so how much and by whom? According to the Boardthey are appointed bythe mutwallisand, therefore, any payment by the board was out of question.
9.   Prima.facie it is not correct as the letter ofappointments issued in some states are from the Board. But assuming that they are appointed by the Mutwallis the Board cannot escape from its responsibility as the mutwallis too u/s. 36 of the Act are under the supervision and control of the Board. In series of decisions rendered by this Court it has beenheld that right to life enshrined in Art. 21 means right to live with human dignity. It is too late in theday, therefore, toclaim or urge that since Imams perform religious duties they are not entitled to any emoluments.
10.   Whatever may leave been the ancient conceptbut it has undergone change and even in Muslim countriesmosques are subsidised and the Imams are paid their remuneration. We are, therefore, not willing to accept the submission that in our set up or in absence of any statutory provision in the Wakf Act the imams who look after the religious activities of mosques are not entitled to any remuneration. Much was arguedon behalf of Union and the Wakf Boards that their financial position was not such that they can meet the obligations of paying the imams as they are being paid in the State of Punjab. It was also urged that the number of mosques is so large that it would entail heavy expenditure which the boards of different States would not be able to bear.We donot find any co-relation between thetwo. Financial difficulties of the institution cannot be above fundamental right of a citizen. If the boards havebeen entrusted with the responsibility of supervision and administering the wakf then it is their duty to harness resources to pay those persons who perform themost important duty namely of leading community prayer in a mosque the very purpose or which it is created. In the circumstanceswe allow this petitions and issue following directions
