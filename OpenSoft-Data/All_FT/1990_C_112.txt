Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Kanpur v B. K. Sharma
Supreme Court of India

9 October 1990
C.A. No. 823 and 824 of 1976
The Judgment was delivered by: S. RANGANATHAN, J.
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the appellant, we find that the precise question raised in the present appeal is squarely covered by the decision of this court in Ahmed Ibrahim Sahigra Dhoraji v. CWT, wherein the impugned judgment of the Allahabad High Court was also approved.
2. In this view, the appeals fail and are, accordingly, dismissed ; but there will be no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
