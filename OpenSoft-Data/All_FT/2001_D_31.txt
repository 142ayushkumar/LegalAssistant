Laxmikant Mohapatra and Anr v Damodar Mishra and Anr
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2002/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We are not inclined to uphold the condition for the bail imposed on the appellants one of whom is a Reader in Mathematics and the other is the Asstt.
2.  Manager in UCO Bank, that they shall not leave the territorial jurisdiction of certain places without permission from the court concerned. For the offence under Section 498-A IPC such a rigourous condition is uncalled for on the fact situation in the case. We, therefore, delete it.
3.  Mr. Hansaria, learned counsel appearing for respondent no.1 contended that appellants were threatening him and for such reason the condition was imposed. Respondent no..1 is residing within the limits of Cuttack city. So if appellants are to proceed to Cuttack for any reason they can do so after giving prior intimation to the SHO of the Police Station within the limits of which the appellants are posted for their work.
4.  This condition will be read as substitution for the condition deleted by us.
This appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
Appeal disposed of.
