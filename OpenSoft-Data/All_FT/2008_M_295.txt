Vinod Kumar Verma v Manmohan Verma and Another
Supreme Court of India

19 August 2008
Civil Appeal Nos. 5220-5221 of 2008 (Arising out of SLP (C) Nos. 11263-11264/2008)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  At the time of hearing of these appeals, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the landlord-respondent submits, on instructions that the possession of the premises in question has already been taken over by the landlord-respondent. That being the position, these appeals have now become in fructuous, which have been filed against the final judgment and order dt.25.02.2008 and 28.03.2008 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in RCR No.49 of 2007 and C.M.No.119 of 2008 (Review) in RCR No.49 of 2007, by which the Revision Petition filed by the tenant/appellant was dismissed and order of eviction was affirmed. Since the possession has already been taken over by the landlord-respondent, in our view nothing survives in these appeals and accordingly, the appeals are disposed of as in fructuous.
Interim order, if any, stands vacated.
There will be no order as to costs.
Order Accordingly
