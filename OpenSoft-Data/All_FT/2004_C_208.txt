Brij Lal and Other v Commissioner of Income Tax and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2004
C.A. Nos. 516 to 527, 528 to 531, 532, 3087, 3091, 3092 and 4599 to 4601 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
We have heard learned counsel for the parties for some time.
1.  Learned counsel for the appellants/petitioners submitted that in the case of CIT vs. Anjum M.H. Ghaswala, decided by the Constitution Bench, the question whether ss. 234A, 234B and 234C of the IT Act, 1961 (for short "the Act"), are at all applicable to proceedings of the Settlement Commission under Chapter XIX-A of the Act did not arise for consideration and the judgment of the Constitution Bench proceeds sub silentio on the point by assuming that these sections are so applicable.
2. However, this is a plea which we deem proper to be considered by a Constitution Bench.
3.  Another question which arises for consideration is whether the Settlement Commission can reopen its concluded proceedings by having recourse to s. 154 of the Act so as to levy interest under ss. 234A, 234B and 234C of the Act, though it was not done in the original proceedings. We think proper to leave this question also to be considered by the Constitution Bench in view of the far reaching implications and the question being of frequent recurrence.
4. Ordered accordingly.
SLP(C) Nos. 15769-15772/2004
5. Leave granted.
6. Printing dispensed with. The appeals shall be heard on the SLPs paperbook. Additional documents, if any, be filed within six weeks. Original record shall be requisitioned.
7. Interim order to continue.
8. Tag with C.A. No. 532 of 2004.
Remaining matters:
9. Service is not complete.
10. The appellants/petitioners to take steps within four weeks for completing the service.
11. The hearing in these matters is separated.
Order accordingly
