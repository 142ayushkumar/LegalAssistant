Sohan Lal v Asha Ram and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 August 1980
C.A. No. 2124 of 1978
The Judgment was delivered by: V. R. KRISHNA IYER, J.
1.  This election appeal would have invited adjudication of the issue raised by the appellant but for the fact that the U.P. Legislative Assembly has since been dissolved, fresh elections having taken place and a fresh House having come into existence with newly elected representatives. Perhaps Shri Lekhi's client has a substantial grievance.
2. It is also possible that the decision of the court below was wrong but we are not inclined to investigate the question at all and, therefore, do not propose to hear either Shri Lekhi or Shri Yogeshwar Prasad. The subsequent events we have adverted to have rendered this litigation so wholly unreal that it will be a waste of this Court's time to consider the issues.
3.  For this reason we dispose of this appeal without adjudication. The same fate will be shared by the cross appeal. Parties will bear their own costs.
Appeal disposed of.
