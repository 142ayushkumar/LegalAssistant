Bhupinder Singh v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 January 1987
W.P. No. 454 and S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 2306 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On October 3, 1985 the officers of the Enforcement Directorate searched House No. B. 20, Gujranwala Town, Part II Delhi and recovered certain quantity of foreign exchange. It appears that the petitioner was not immediately available. He was called and interrogated. He made a statement which was recorded by the officers of the Enforcement Doctorate. On March 19, 1986 an order for detention of the petitioner was made by the Shri M. L. Wadhawan, Additional Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, New Delhi.
2. The petitioner was arrested on April 16, 1986 and served with a copy of the order of detention. Grounds of detention were served on him four days later. On May 12, 1986 he was produced before the Advisory Board. He made a complaint before the Advisory Board that the copies of documents which are supplied to him alongwith the grounds of detention were not legible and he also placed before the Advisory Board a copy of representation said to have been made by him for supply of eligible copies of documents.
3. There is a controversy whether this representation was made on May 8, 1986 or May 12, 1986. From the original files produced before us we find that the representation was typed on May 8, 1986, but actually signed by the detenu on May 12, 1986. But that would not make any difference for the purposes of this case. On May 19, 1986 the Under Secretary to the Government of India conceded the demand of the detenu for eligible copies of documents and directed the Directorate of Enforcement to supply a duplicate set of documents to the petitioner.
4. A copy of this letter was also sent to the detenu and was acknowledged by him on May 21, 1986. There is a controversy as regards the date on which the legible copies of documents were actually given to the detenu. According to the detenu they were served to him on July 1, 1986, whereas according to the counter affidavit of Shri S. K. Chowdhary Under Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, the documents were supplied on June 21, 1986. It does not make any difference whether the documents were supplied on June 21, 1986 or on July 1, 1986 since we find that even before legible copies of documents were supplied to the detenu, the detention order was confirmed on June 14, 1986.
5. The detenu was thus clearly denied the opportunity of making a representation and there was therefore a clear contravention of the right guaranteed by Article 22 of the Constitution. The detenu is entitled to be set at liberty. We are told that the detenu is now on parole. He need not surrender2. In SLP (Crl.) 2306/86 special leave is granted and the appeal is allowed in terms of the above order in the writ petition.
Appeal Allowed.
