The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. Leave granted.
3. The acquisition which had been made in the year 1980 is subject matter of challenge in the appeal. The Notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act had been issued on 24.06.1980 for acquisition of appellant(s) property and declaration under Section 6 was issued on 17.10.1980.
4. There was an interim stay by the Division Bench of the High Court in the Writ Petition filed by the several persons including the appellant(s) herein.
5. The Haryana Urban Development Authority issued a Notification under Section 4 on 29.01.1990 and thereafter a similar Notification under Section 4, issued on 26.04.1995.
6. The matter had been decided by the High Court on 12.11.2009. There were certain interim orders which were passed by the High Court restraining the Government from seeking possession of the land. Thereafter, award had been passed on 09.08.2010.
7. The matter came to this Court on 08.03.2010. This Court passed the order of staus quo with respect to the possession and at the time of passing of the award, there was no interim stay on proceedings by this Court. Passing of the award was not stayed by this Court.
8. Mr. Amarendra Saran, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has argued that once fresh Notification under Section 4 was issued on 29.01.1990, followed by another notification under Section 4 on 26.04.1995. By these notifications acquisition of the land of the appellant(s) stood abandoned and it was not open to give effect to the Notification dated 24.06.1980. It was also urged that inquiry under Section 5A was not properly conducted and the appellants were not given an opportunity to participate in inquiry under Section 5A of the Act. The passing of the award on 09.08.2010 was bad in law for the reason that there was interim order granted by this Court with respect to possession. It was further submitted by Mr. Saran that certain lands had been released out of the same zone reserved for economically weaker sections of the society, whereas the prayer made by the appellant(s) for releasing the land had been rejected on the ground that the land of the appellant(s) fell in Zone II, which was reserved for economically weaker sections of the society. It was also urged that they are ready to provide Group Housing Scheme for economically weaker sections of the society, in case their land is released. Thus, it would be in the interest of justice to quash the order with respect to rejecting the prayer of the appellant for releasing of the land.
9. Mr. Ajay Bansal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents submitted that there was no abandonment of acquisition with regard to land covered under Notification dated 24.06.1980 issued under Section 4 of the Act. As a matter of fact, there was additional requirement of land and due to interim stay of the Court, certain fresh notifications were issued that too after 10 years and 15 years of the notification issued under Section 4 of the Act in the instant case. The issuance of fresh notifications would not come in the way of the acquisition in question in the instant case as it has never been abandoned. Learned counsel contended that land could not have been released as it was falling within zone II, reserved for economically weaker sections of society. The inquiry under Section 5A had also been held before issuance of declaration under Section 6 but no objections were preferred by the appellants under Section 5A and it appears that some of them have acquired the land and after issuance of the notification under Section 4 they could not question the legality of the acquisition. It was further contended that since there were interim orders passed by the High Court as such award could not have been passed, this Court has only ordered status quo with respect to possession that is why award had been passed on 09.08.2010. Hence no case for interference is made out.
10. Firstly, we examine the question of abandonment. No doubt that three successive notifications had been issued under Section 4 of the Act and there has been lot of time gap in these notifications. First notification in the instant matter was issued in the year 1980, subsequent notification was issued after 10 years in 1990, and thereafter in April, 1995. The land of the appellants were excluded from subsequent acquisition, by modifying the notification. It could not be said that there was subsequent notification with respect to some of the same land. Since there was further requirement of land which arose and there was necessity for acquisition of other land, it was open to the respondents to make fresh acquisition.
11. Secondly, coming to the question of no proper inquiry held under Section 5A. The inquiry was held under Section 5A. It is clear from the elaborate judgment of the High Court that due publicity had been made in the village/locality and a large number of objections had been preferred which also makes it clear that due opportunity had been given to the persons in the village and they were aware about the acquisition. The objections had not been submitted by the appellants. The submission is thus too tenuous to be accepted.
12. Thirdly, coming to the submission raised by learned Senior Counsel that there was discrimination in not releasing the land. It was submitted that land of others in the same zone had been released and discrimination had been made with respect to the appellants. It was clarified by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents that land which had been released fell under another Zone and not in Zone II, which was reserved for economically weaker sections of the society. Be that as it may. We are of the considered opinion that there is no concept of negative equality. In case any land had been released by the respondent(s), out of the land reserved for economically weaker sections of the society, it would not give any legal right to appellants as such land should not have to be released.
13. We cannot perpetuate illegality as that would be against interest of weaker sections of the society. Thus, we find that once the land is reserved in Zone II which is reserved for economically weaker sections of the society, it was not open to release the land and no illegality had been committed by the respondents by rejecting the prayer made by the appellant(s) for release of land.
14. Coming to the another submission raised by Mr. Saran that appellants are holder of an agreement and are ready to provide Housing Scheme to the economically weaker sections of the society. We are not at all impressed by this submission. In the circumstances of the instant case such a prayer cannot be allowed as the economically weaker sections of the society cannot be deprived of their right of having the benefits for which they are entitled to under the scheme of planned development. There was no interim stay on passing of award as such it was rightly passed.
15. Thus, we find no ground for interference in the judgment and order passed by the High Court. Appeals being bereft of merits are dismissed. No costs.
Appeals dismissed
