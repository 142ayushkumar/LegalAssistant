Balveer v State of Rajasthan
Supreme Court of India

12 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1259/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court has rejected the bail application filed bythe petitioner. In our view there is no justifiable reason forinterfering with the said order. However, learned counsel for thepetitioner submits that some other accused, who were involved in thesame case, are released on bail.
2. In our view, that would hardly bea ground for releasing the petitioner on bail who is the mainaccused.
3.  Further, if the High Court has released some other accusederroneously on bail that also would not furnish a good ground forreleasing the petitioner on bail.
4. Hence this bail application is rejected. However, the trial court is directed to expedite the trial.
This special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
