Goplramnath v Muthuvelu
Supreme Court of India

12  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1859-1861/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are also concerned with the dilatory tactics adopted by the respondent so far by dodging cross examination of the witnesses who were examined in chief.
2.  Yet we persuaded ourselves not to issue notice to the respondent as that would provide yet another opportunity to him for further protracting the matter.
3.  We have taken note of the observation made by the High Court in the impugned order that if the respondent is not availing himself of the last given opportunity to cross examine the witnesses he shall be foreclosed from cross examining the witnesses thereafter.
With these observations the SLPs are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
