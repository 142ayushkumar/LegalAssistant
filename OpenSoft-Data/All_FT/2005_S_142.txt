Supreme Court of India

26 April 2005
C.A. No. 2924 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 10061 of 2005 (CC No. 4706 of 2005))
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  Heard the learned counsel for the appellants as well as the learned counsel for Respondent 1, who is the sole contesting respondent.
2.  By the impugned order the High Court directed the first appeal, filed by the appellants and dismissed earlier in default of appearance, to be restored for hearing but subject to deposit of an amount of Rs 39,22,425.40 paise with interest calculated at the rate of 12% per annum with half-yearly rests and calculated from the date of the filing of the suit till the date of deposit.
3.  We have perused the decree passed as also the several orders passed at earlier stages of these proceedings. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are satisfied that the ends of justice would meet if an amount of Rs 35 lakhs is deposited by the appellants with the trial court within a period of eight weeks from today, a condition precedent to the restoration of the appeal for hearing before the High Court.
It is directed accordingly.
4.  The impugned order of the High Court stands modified as indicated hereinabove. In the event of the appellants failing to deposit the amount as directed hereinabove the impugned order of the High Court shall stand.
5. The amount, if deposited, shall be available to be withdrawn by the decree-holder Respondent 1 by furnishing security for restitution to the satisfaction of the trial court.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
