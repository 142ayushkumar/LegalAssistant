Satish Kumar v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 March 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The conviction of the appellant for the offence under Sections 302/201 Indian Penal code and the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for life and one year respectively for the said offences as imposed by the trial court was upheld by this Court reversing the order of acquittal made by the High Court. It is not denied that the appellant who is a graduate had been given 'B' class facilities in the jail, both during the period of trial and subsequently after conviction also. By government instructions issued on 21-1-1985, 'B' class facilities were sought to be withdrawn from the convicts who are convicted for committing murder of the bride for dowry.
2.  In the instant case, on facts, it deserves to be noticed that no finding was recorded either by the trial court or by this Court that the appellant had committed the murder of his wife, Smt. Shashi Bala, on account of non-receipt of dowry. It is conceded that there is no finding that it was a case of dowry death. On facts, therefore, the government instructions issued on 21-1-1985 would not be applicable to the case of the appellant. Even otherwise, we have doubts whether Para 576-A of the Punjab Jail Manual could be amended by mere executive instructions, as has been done on 21-1-1985, and the effect of the instructions being extended even to cases where convictions stood already recorded, but we express no opinion on that issue and leave that question open to be decided in an appropriate case.
3.   The appeal succeeds, on facts, and the respondents are directed to give the benefit of 'B' class facilities to the appellant while undergoing the sentence in jail.
Appeal allowed.
