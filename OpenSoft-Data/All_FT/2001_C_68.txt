Ashok Kumar Aggarwal v Central Bureau of Investigation
Supreme Court of India

8 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3021/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr. Jaspal Singh, learned senior counsel submits that petitioner is not interested now in urging the question whether a co-accused has a right to cross-examine a person to whom pardon is tendered during the proceedings for tendering such pardon. Learned senior counsel submits that he wants to urge the point that the special Judge under the Prevention of Corruption Act has no power to grant pardon during the stage of investigation. We are not inclined to entertain such a plea.
2.  This stage as the stage for raising such a contention would arise only if any person is examined in the court of special Judge as an approver. Without prejudice to the right of the petitioner to raise such contention, if he feels that such contention is necessary, we dispose of this Special Leave Petition with the above observations.
Petition disposed of.
