Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18547/2000
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have perused the orders passed by the Rent Controller, the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court.
2.  We are satisfied that on the facts and circumstances of the case as emerging from the material on record the Tribunal was justified in holding that Section 14(1)(k) of Delhi Rent Control Act had been complied with by the landlord, and the High Court rightly confirmed the same.
3.  Regarding Section 14(11) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958, the order of the Tribunal shows that the parties were directed to appear before the Rent Controller on the date specified in the order. It is stated before us that the said proceeding is pending before the Controller.
The special leave petition being devoid of merit is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
