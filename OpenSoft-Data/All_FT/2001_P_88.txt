Maharashtra State Sec. and Higher Sec.Board v Pashmeen N. Ghai and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10738-10739/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard Mr. Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel for the petitioner - Board and M/s. R.F. Nariman, and Lalit, learned counsel appearing for the respondents.
2.  In matters pertaining to discipline in educational institutions in particular and other educational matters in general, the High Court must exercise its power of judicial review with caution and interfere only in exceptional cases which are clearly made out. The High Court in the present case appears to have overlooked this salutary principle.
3.  Indeed, the rule which was breached by the respondents had a salutary purpose to achieve and such rule is required to be respected by compliance and not by breach. We do not agree with the approach and reasoning adopted by the High Court in the impugned judgment. However, looking to the consequences which the setting aside of the judgment and order of the High Court may entail on the career of two respondents - both brilliant students - whose innocence while committing breach of the rule is not disputed, we are not inclined to invoke our discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution.
4. We, however, wish to emphasise that the judgment of the High Court under challenge before us shall be considered as confined only to the peculiar facts of the present case and not laying down any law in general terms.
5.  Leave to appeal is refused. The special leave petitions are, therefore, dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
