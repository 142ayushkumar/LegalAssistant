V. Bhaskar Rao and Others v Ganga Rao K. and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6790/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We have also perused the judgment passed by the High Court which is under challenge and the other relevant papers placed before us by learned counsel for the parties.
2.  The short question that arises for consideration is whether the High Court committed an error in holding that the application filed by the petitioners seeking determination of the mesne profits/damages in the final decree proceeding was, in the facts and circumstances of the case was not maintainable. On perusal of the record we find that in the memo filed on behalf of the petitioner before the trial court it was stated inter alia that the question of mesne profits/damages may be left open to be decided later in the proceedings.
3.  There is no direction in the preliminary decree or the final decree for determination of mesne profit/damages in the proceeding.
4. In the absence of any direction either in preliminary decree or final decree for holding enquiry as to mesne-profits, the High Court was right and justified in passing the order under challenge. The said order does not suffer from any infirmity which warrants interference by the court having regard to facts and circumstances of the case.
Hence the special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
