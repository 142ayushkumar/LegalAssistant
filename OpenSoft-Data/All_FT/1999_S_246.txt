State of Andhra Pradesh and Others v Tuljaram Balaji and Another
Supreme Court of India

20 August 1999
C.A. No. 4692 of 1999 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (C) No. 20812 of 1998)
The order of the court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The facts of this case are similar to the facts of Civil Appeal No. 6066 of 1995 (State of Maharashtra v. Digambar 1995 Indlaw SC 3011995 Indlaw SC 3011995 Indlaw SC 301. In that case this Court has held that the High Court was not right in entertaining the petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution as it was filed after a delay of 20 years. In this case, the delay is of 27 years.  Therefore, following the decision of this Court in that case, this appeal is allowed. The judgment and order passed by the High Court in Writ Appeal No. 890 of 1998 is set aside and the writ petition filed by the writ petitioners in the High Court stands dismissed. We, however, observe that in case the writ petitioners are able to prove that they had not voluntarily given up the land and that the possession of land was forcibly taken over by the State Government, the State Government may consider giving of compensation to the respondents.
We have made this observation in view of peculiar facts and circumstances of this case and, therefore, this observation should not be treated as having been made for the benefit of all similarly situated persons.
Appeal allowed.
