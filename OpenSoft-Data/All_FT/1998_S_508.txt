1.  These appeals are in respect of licences for retail vending of country liquor for the year 1980-81. What was challenged in the HIGH Court was the direction given in the Radiogram dated September 16, 1980, by the Excise Commissioner, U.P. The directions were in respect of number of shops which could be permitted to be opened for vending country liquor and bhang. Since the matters are of 1980-81, they really now do not survive as they have become infructuous.
Therefore, keeping the question of law open, the appeals are dismissed
