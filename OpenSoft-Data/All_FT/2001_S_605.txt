Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 6587/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard Mr. Shirish Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner.
In the order under challenge the High Court has observed inter alia that the petitioner may renew his prayer for bail after four months. The order was passed on 26.9.2001. The petitioner has been in jail since 15.6.2001.
2. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the submissions made by learned counsel for the petitioner we are of the view that the High Court was not justified in asking the petitioner to wait for four months.
3.  It is therefore ordeered that if the petitoner files a fresh application for bail before the High Court the same will be disposed of on merit expeditiously notwithstanding the observations in the order under challenge.
The special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
