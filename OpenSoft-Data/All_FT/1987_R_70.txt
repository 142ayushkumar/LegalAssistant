Rampyari Bai v Municipal Corporation and Another
Supreme Court of India

13 January 1987
C.A. No. 8762 of 1985 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 27 April 1985 of the High Court of M.P. at Jabalpur in Civil Misc. Case No. 209/85)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This special leave petition is against the judgment of the High Court of M.P. at Jabalpur. The question was whether the petitioner Rampyari Bai was valid married wife of Mannulal. According to the plaintiff she had married Manulal about 30 years prior to his death and had been living with him as his wife Ramdulari Bai has not been living with him. It has been held by the first appellant court that the factum as well as the validity of the plaintiff's marriage with Mannulal has not been proved and, therefore, there could not be any valid nomination made in her favour by Mannulal, according to the rules applicable to the payment of family pension.
2. The first appellate court on facts found that there was no marriage. In appeal the High Court of M.P. affirmed the decision of the first appellate court and negatived the claim of the petitioner. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case we do not see any reason to interfere with the decision of the High Court. There is no merit in this case. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
