Lal Umesh Bahadur Pal and Others v Commissioner of Income Tax, Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

17 September 1971
C.A. No. 17 of 1969
The Judgment was delivered by: HEGDE, J.
The question referred to the High Court for its decision is:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal acted rightly in holding that the sum of Rs. 64,020 was not assessable as income of the assessee in the assessment year 1956-57."
1.  The High Court answered the question in favour of the department. The decision of the High Court must be held to be clearly wrong. See the decision of this court in Commissioner of Income tax v. Amalgamated Development Ltd. In that case this court ruled that:
"The amount of the consideration not received by the assessee but which the purchasers agreed to pay in future and for which lands were mortgaged by them in favour of the assessee, could not be considered to be revenue receipts for the assessment periods, and the assessee was liable to be taxed only on the actual realisations in cash."
This decision completely covers the facts of this case.
2.  In the result this appeal is allowed, the answer given by the High Court is discharged and in its place we answer the question in favour of the assessee and against the department. The department to pay the costs in this appeal to the assessee.
Appeal allowed.
