Ex-CAPTAIN Vedpal and Others v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 November 1986
W.Ps. (Civil) Nos. 3379-81 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
In the counter-affidavit, in paragraph 6, it is stated:
"The State Government has already taken tentative decision to allow to the petitioners the benefit of military service rendered by them up to the termination of emergency i. e. January 10, 1968. The revised seniority list has been circulated subject to representations by the affected officers"
1.  Our judgment after review entitled these officers to get credit for the period of military service rendered by them up to the termination of emergency. The tentative decision of the government is, therefore, in accord with our decision. We understand that the final seniority list after hearing the objections has also been prepared. Nothing more needs to be done. If any one is entitled to any consequential benefit as a result of the revised seniority list, they will submit their claims to the government, who we hope, will consider their representations. If any of these persons continue to have grievance, they will approach the High Court for appropriate relief.
Order accordingly.
