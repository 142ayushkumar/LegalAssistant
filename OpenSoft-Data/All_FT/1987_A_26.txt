Additional Commissioner of Income Tax, Kanpur and Another v J. K. Synthetics Limited
Supreme Court of India

19 November 1987
C.As. Nos. 980 and 981 of 1975 (Appeals against the judgment and order Dt. 7 May 1974, of the Allahabad High Court in W.P. No. 247 of 1974)
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  The crucial question which arises in these appeals is whether an order of an Income-tax Officer merges in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner even in respect of those points decided by the Income-tax Officer which are not the subject matter of the appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
2.  It is clear that in view of the decision of this court in J.K. Synthetics Ltd. v. CIT 1981 Indlaw SC 337, the question set out earlier has become academic in these cases because even if it is answered in favour of the appellants, the appellants must still lose on the merits. There is no serious controversy in this regard.
3.  In these circumstances, we do not feel called upon to decide the question and dismiss the appeals with no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
