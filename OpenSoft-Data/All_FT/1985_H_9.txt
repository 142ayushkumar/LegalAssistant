Harbans Singh, Shani Devi and Others v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 February 1985
C.As. Nos. 470 and 471 of 1985 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. Nos. 12723 & 12747 of 1984).
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Having regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case and particularly in view of the fact that the appointment of the arbitrator was not made by the Union of India for a period of over 16 years, we think this is a fit case in which solatium at the rate of 30 per cent of the amount of compensation and interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum should be awarded to the appellants.
2.   We are making this order having regard to the fact that the law has in the meanwhile been amended with a view to providing solatium at the rate of 30 per cent and interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum. The appeal is accordingly disposed of but with no orders as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
