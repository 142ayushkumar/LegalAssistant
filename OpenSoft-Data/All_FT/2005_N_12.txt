Sanjay Kumar Gulati v N. P. Singh and another
Supreme Court of India

28 January 2005
C.A. No. 788 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 20710 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Application for setting aside the abatement and application for bringing LRs on record are allowed.
Leave granted.
2.  We see no ground to interfere with the order of eviction passed by the trial court as affirmed by the High Court in revision. The trial court after referring to the evidence has given a clear finding that the building was constructed only in or after the year 1988.
3. Therefore, by the time the suit was filed, the building was less than ten years old. Hence, it was rightly held that the landlord can invoke the benefit of Explanation I to Section 2(2) of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972.
4.  Hence, the appeal is dismissed. However, time for vacation of the premises is extended up to the end of July 2005, subject to furnishing usual undertaking to this effect in the Registry of this Court within four weeks.
Appeal dismissed.
