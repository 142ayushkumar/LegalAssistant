Messrs Jitinder Filling Station v Miri Ram Gian Chand and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7529-7530/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Upon hearing submissions made on behalf of the parties and on perusal of the records it appears that the High Court disposed of the two Civil Revision Nos.672 of 2001 and 1081 of 2001 with a direction for expeditious disposal of the matter. In our view no exception can possibly be taken to such an order of expeditious disposal.
2. The High Court also noted the factum of resiting of the pump on 5.3.2001 and having regard to the balance of convenience and the concept of irreparable injury, the High Court directed the status quo to continue.
3. We do not see any reason at this juncture specially in the wake of expeditious disposal to intervene under Article 136 of the Constitution. As such, these special leave petitions fail and are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
