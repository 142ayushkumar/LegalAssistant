Vijayakumar Bhavanirao Kulkarni v Khadarabi and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19431-19432/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave granted.
1.  By the impugned order, the High Court arrived at a conclusion that the Insurance Company would not be liable on the ground that the deceased was a gratuitous passenger. For that purpose the Court relied on the decision rendered by this Court in Smt. Mallawwa etc. vs. Oriental Insurance Com. Ltd. and others.
2.  Learned counsel for the appellant rightly pointed out that the case of Smt. Mallawwa etc. (Supra) would not be applicable to the facts of the present case because the accident took place on 13th July, 1996 i.e. after coming into force of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. This question is decided by this Court in New India Assurance Co. vs. Satpal Singh and others.
3. Hence, the owner of the vehicle is entitled to reimbursement of the compensation amount deposited by him.
4.  We direct the Insurance Company to do so within eight weeks from today. The appeals are allowed accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
