Supreme Court of India

10 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6983/2000
The Order of the Court was as folows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that at the time when the petitioner filed this special leave petition, a civil suit filed by the petitioner on 3rd January, 1997 was still pending. It is submitted that as pointed out by the private respondents in their counter affidavit, that civil suit has been decided on 2nd November, 2000. Having come to know about it now, the petitioner is advised to take appropriate proceedings challenging the judgment and decree of the trial court in the civil suit.
2. It is submitted that the petitioner may be permitted to withdraw this special leave petition and be granted liberty to file an appeal against the judgment and decree of the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Abohar dated 2nd November, 2000. It is submitted that because of the pendency of the proceedings in this Court, the respondents may not raise the plea of `limitation' against the petitioner in the event an appeal is filed. Learned counsel appearing for all the respondents submit that they shall not raise the plea of `limitation' in the event such an appeal is filed by the petitioner within one month from today, but that they reserve their right to contest the appeal, if filed, on merits.
3.  We record the statement of the learned counsel for the respondents and bind them with it. While dismissing the special leave petition as withdrawn we also grant liberty, as prayed for by learned counsel for the petitioner.
Petition dismissed.
