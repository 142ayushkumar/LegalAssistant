Ismail Rasulbhai Vohra v Regional Director, S. T., Vadodara
Supreme Court of India

16 July 1990
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 2907 of 1988 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 17 December 1987 of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in S.C.A. No. 4544 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Though notice was ordered on the earlier occasion and the matter has come up thereafter, we have looked into the papers again and are satisfied that the cause of justice would be better served in not entertaining the claim for back wages by two reasons:
(1) On his own showing the workman has been earning during the period he was out of employment; and
(2) He had at one stage in the original form given up his claim for back wages and there is no explanation as to why the surrender of the claim had been made and later revived.
The order for notice is recalled and the SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
