Anita Bhatia and Others v Kenyan Airways
Supreme Court of India

20 February 2006
C.A. No. 27965 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Delay condoned.
2. Heard the learned senior counsel for both the parties at length. We do not find any justification to interfere with the impugned order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. We, therefore, dismiss this appeal.
1. However, the dismissal of this appeal shall not preclude the appellants herein from filing a civil suit as directed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in its review order dated 19.10.2005. We also direct the Civil Court to dispose of the suit as expeditiously as possible. The suit shall be filed within a period of two months from today as undertaken by the learned counsel for the appellants. We make it clear that the proposed suit before the appropriate Court would be only in respect of the quantum of compensation.
No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
