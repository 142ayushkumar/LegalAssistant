Collector of Central Excise, Baroda v Extrusion Processes Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

15 July 1997
C.A. No. 1918 of 1989, (Arising as an appeal against CEGAT Order No. 503/87-B1, Dt. 9 September 1987.)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The respondent is a manufacturer of printed aluminium collapsible tubes containers falling under Tariff Item No. 27, of the erstwhile Central Excise Tariff. In the Budget of 1980, Section 2(f), of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 and tariff description of Item No. 27(f) were amended to specifically include lacquered/printed aluminium containers. The assessee claimed that it was not liable to pay duty on the basis of the amended provisions introduced in the 1980, Budget because the products has already been manufactured before June 19, 1980. The Collector of Central Excise (Appeals) in his Order dated January 7, 1982, accepted the case of the assessee that the goods had been fully manufactured and ready for sale on June 18/19, 1980.
2. He however, held that since they were removed from the factory after that date, they were liable to payment of duty as per the amended provisions. The said view of the Collector has been reversed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal by the impugned judgment.
3.  The said view of the Tribunal is in consonance with the decision of this Court in Collector of Central Excise, Hyderabad etc. v. M/s. Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd. 1996 Indlaw SC 6171996 Indlaw SC 617 wherein it has been laid down that the taxable event is the manufacture or production of goods and not removal of goods that has been manufactured prior to March 1, 1978, but removed after March 1, 1978, would not attract levy of duty which came into effect on and from March 1, 1978.
4. In view of the said judgment, we do not find any merit in this appeal and it is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
