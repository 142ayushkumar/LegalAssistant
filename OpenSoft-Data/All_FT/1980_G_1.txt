1.  This appeal by special leave is directed against a judgment of Allahabad High Court. The only short point raised by Mr. Garg is that the finding of mala fides given by the High Court and the observations made by it against the appellants ought not to have been made because the material produced before the High Court was not sufficient to warrant such finding or observations.
2.  Mr. Goyal submits that so far as the respondent is concerned, he had already been allowed to pass all the examinations and has now started his practice and is not at all interested in whatever may happen to the appellants. Mr. Goyal has stated that he does not want to press any finding arrived at or observations made against the appellants.
3. Accordingly, all the finding and observations mentioned in the first paragraph of this Order are hereby expunged.
4. The appeal thus stands disposed of. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
