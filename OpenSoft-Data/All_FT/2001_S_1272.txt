State of Uttar Pradesh v V.M.Singh and Anr
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8535-8536/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Considering the stand taken by the State Government and the affidavit which is tendered after a lapse of long time, we do not think that impugned orders passed by the High Court calls for any interference as the appointment of the commissioner was only to assist the Court and the amount fixed is also meagre.
Hence these petitions are dismissed.
2.  The amount which is ordered to be deposited by the State of U.P. shall be taken by the Registry and transfered to Supreme Court Legal Services Committee Fund. Commissioner to expedite the work.
Petitions dismissed.
