Narcotics Control Bureau v Karma Phuntsok and others
Supreme Court of India

22 August 2005
Cr.As. Nos. 1046-47 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (Cri.) Nos. 5220-21 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  These appeals are directed against the orders dated 11-9-2003 and 25-9-2003, passed by the Delhi High Court, suspending the conviction during the pendency of the appeal.
2.  The respondents were convicted u/s. 29 read with S. 20(b)(ii)(c) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, (the NDPS Act) and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and a fine of Rs 1000.
3. On appeals being filed, the learned Judge suspended the sentence and the respondents were enlarged on bail on executing a personal bond for a sum of Rs 50,000 with one surety for the like amount, to the satisfaction of the trial court.
4.  We have perused the order passed by the learned Judge and we find that there is not even a whisper about the condition contained in S. 37 of the NDPS Act with regard to enlarging of the accused on bail.
5.  Mr Jaspal Singh, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents contended that the learned Public Prosecutor did not oppose the bail as contained in S. 37(1)(b)(ii) of the NDPS Act. According to him, unless the Public Prosecutor opposes the bail application, S. 37 will not apply.
6.  Mr Singh seriously contended that inasmuch as the appellant have not put on record that the Public Prosecutor had opposed the granting of bail it must be presumed that this is an order covered under S. 37(3) read with S. 439 CrPC. To say the least, the argument appears to be baseless.
7.  We cannot accept the contention that in a matter involving seizure of commercial quantity of a substance prohibited by the NDPS Act when the Public Prosecutor appears on notice of the bail application, he would be standing there as a mute spectator not opposing the bail application unless he was at the beck of the accused. We find no substance in this argument.
8.  In our view, the very fact that the Public Prosecutor appeared would suggest that he appeared to oppose the bail application. In any event, the order of the High Court does not suggest that the Public Prosecutor had agreed for bail being granted. In the aforesaid circumstances, we find no substance whatsoever in the contention raised by Mr Singh.
9.  In the view that we have taken, both the orders dated 11-9-2003 and 25-9-2003 passed by the High Court are set aside and the appeals are allowed.
10.  The bail bonds of the accused stand cancelled. They are directed to be taken back into custody forthwith. Compliance report within two weeks.
Appeals allowed.
