Commissioner Of Central Excise, Aurangabad v Caprihans India Ltd
Supreme Court of India

29 April 2008
C.A. No. 7634 of 2002 withC.A.Nos. 4494-4495 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question which fell for consideration before the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (for short, 'the Tribunal') was whether the benefit of exemption as per Entry 57 of the table to Notification No. 4/97 dated 1st March 1997 was available to the respondent in respect of the product, viz., 'SUNPAC' being manufactured by it. As per the said entry goods classifiable under heading 39.23, 39.24 and 39.26 of the schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act other than the goods of polyurethane, insulated ware, bags or sacks made out of fabrics woven from strips or tapes of plastic and fabrics for making bags or sacks, were fully exempt from payment of duty.
2.  The respondent claimed classification of the said product under sub-heading 3926.90 of Chapter 39. A show cause notice was issued to the respondent demanding duty on the ground that the said product is classifiable under Chapter Heading 3920.39 as a sheet of plastic. Respondent filed its reply. Relying on a decision of the Tribunal in Appeal No. 2597 of 1985 holding that it was not a sheet, the Assistant Commissioner dropped the demand.
3. However, the Commissioner allowed the appeal filed by the Revenue holding that the aforementioned decision of the Tribunal would not apply and the said product would be classifiable under Chapter Heading 39.20 and hence not entitled to exemption.
4.  On an appeal filed by the respondent, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the product manufactured by the respondent would not be classifiable either under Chapter Heading 3926.90 or 3920.39 but the same would fall under Heading 39.16. In view of this, the Tribunal concluded that the respondent would not be entitled to the benefit of exemption under entry 57 of the table to the impugned notification since that entry does not include articles of Heading 39.16.
5.  We agree with the view taken by the Tribunal that the aforesaid entry of the impugned notification does not entitle the respondent to claim exemption.
6.  This controversy does not remain alive any longer as it is brought to our notice that the exemption has already been removed and same amount of duty has been made applicable under Chapter Heading 3926, 3920 and 3916.
7.  The appeals are dismissed leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
Appeals dismissed.
