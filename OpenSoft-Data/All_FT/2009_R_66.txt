The only question raised is that since the parties have settled their dispute and want to compound the offence i.e Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short 'the Act'), the court should have permit it to be in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short 'Code').
