Topline Shoes Limited and Anr v Corporation Bank and Anr
Supreme Court of India

21 November 2000
C.A..No.7132/1999
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  In this appeal the appellants are calling in question an order made by the National Consumers Disputes Redressal Commission ( for short 'the Commission') by which it declined to adjudicate the grievance raised by the appellants by stating that it was not an appropriate forum.
2.  It is brought to our notice by the learned counsel for the respondent bank that a proceeding is pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal at Ahmedabad (for short 'the Tribunal') against the appellant and the appellant brings to our notice that he has already made a counter claim in that proceeding and both submit the proceedings before the Commission and the Tribunal arise out of same cause of action. If that is so, appropriate course for the appellant would be to pursue the remedy before the Tribunal rather than the remedy before the Commission. Perhaps bearing this aspect in view the Commission has passed the order under appeal.
3. In that view of the matter we think it appropriate not to interfere with the order made by the Commission. The appeal is therefore dismissed. However, we make it clear that it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible.
Appeal dismissed.
