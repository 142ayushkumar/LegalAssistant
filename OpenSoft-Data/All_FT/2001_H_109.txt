Hind Equipment Corporation Private Limited and Anr v Messrs Associate Enterprise and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19304/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
Taken on board.
1.  This is a clear case of an abuse of the process of the Court. Decree was passed in favour of the respondent in 1987, under one ploy or the other the execution has been thwarted. The decree was a subject matter of appeal and even this Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition (C) No. 16169/2000 on 12th October, 2000, thereby upholding the decree. It is clear that any suit filed thereafter purporting to challenge the validity of the decree would not be maintainable.
2. We see no reason to interfere in this petition which is, accordingly, dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
