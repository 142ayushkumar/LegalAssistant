Commissioner of Income Tax v Novelty Jewellers
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2001
C.A. No. 1777 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  We are of the view that questions of law do arise, but we entirely agree that the questions could have been better drafted.
2. We thing, therefore, that the order under challenge should be set aside and the Tribunal directed to refer to the High Court for its consideration a question or questions reframed to bring out the precise point of law involved, after drafting an appropriate statement of case. For the purposes of refraining the questions, the Tribunal shall give notice to both the parties.
The civil appeal is allowed accordingly.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
