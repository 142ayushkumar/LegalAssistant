Commissioner of Gift Tax, Madras v C. Muth Kumarswamy Mudaliar
Supreme Court of India

31 January 1995
C.A. No. 899 of 1977
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal by the Revenue is by a certificate granted by the High Court. The question of law referred to the High Court for its decision was as under:
"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in holding that Section 17(1)(a) of the Gift tax Act, 1958, as amended by the Gift Tax Amendment Act, 1962, would not apply to the levy of penalty in this case?"
2.  The High Court answered the question against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee. This has given rise to the present appeal.
3.  The material facts are only a few. The last date for filing the return under the Gift Tax Act by the assessee was 30-6-1962. The assessee filed the return on 22-10-1963. The assessment was completed on 31-3-1964 and a notice was issued to the assessee to show cause why penalty should not be imposed in terms of Section 17(1)(a) of the Act failure to file the return within the prescribed period. The assessee gave the reply on 29-4-1964. The Gift Tax Officer imposed a penalty of Rs.2605, which was reduced on appeal by the Commissioner to Rs.1000.
4. Thereafter the Tribunal took the view that the question of imposition of penalty in this case will be governed by the provision in Section 17(1)(a) of the Act as it stood prior to its amendment w.e.f. 1-4-1963, under which there was no requirement to impose a minimum penalty as prescribed by the amendment. The Tribunal's order, therefore, gave rise to the aforesaid question of law which requires the decision on the point whether the amendment made w.e.f. 1-4-1963 in Section 17(1)(a) prescribing a more harsh penalty, is attracted in the present case.
5.  The High Court, as stated earlier, has affirmed the view taken by the Tribunal, and answered the question of law against the Revenue. The High Court has clearly stated that the assessee not having filed the return by the last date prescribed for filing the return, i.e. 30-6-1962, had rendered himself liable for levy of penalty on that day in accordance with the provision as it stood prior to its amendment on 1-4-1963.
6.  We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and are satisfied that there is no ground to interfere in this appeal. It cannot be disputed that the liability for penalty was incurred by the assessee on his failure to file the return on 30-6-1962, i.e. much before the amendment was made in the provision w.e.f. 1-4-1963. It cannot also be doubted that in the event of the adjudication for imposition of penalty being completed prior to 1-4-1963, which possibility, as a matter of law, cannot be excluded, the question of applying the amended provision would not have arisen and the question of penalty to be imposed on the assessee had to be determined in accordance with the law existing prior to the amendment. This alone is sufficient to indicate the fallacy in the contention of the Revenue.
Consequently, the appeal fails and is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
