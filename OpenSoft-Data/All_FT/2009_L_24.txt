T. Madhava Reddy and Another v Land Acquisition Officer-Cum-Mandal Revenue
Supreme Court of India

22 January 2009
Civil Appeal No. 4070 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The Land Acquisition Officer awarded compensation in relation to the land belonging to Appellant No.1 at the rate of rupees ten thousand per acre, whereas in relation to Appellant No.2 compensation was awarded at the rate of Rupees six thousand per acre. On an application filed under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the Reference Court after making a detailed analysis of the evidence produced by the parties, enhanced the compensation in relation to the land of Appellant No.1 from Rupees ten thousand per acre to rupees twenty thousand per acre, whereas, in relation to the land of Appellant no.2 from rupees six thousand per acre to rupees ten thousand per acre. On appeal, the High Court reversed that order.
2.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records, we are of the view that the impugned order is liable to be set aside because the High Court has not recorded any reason whatsoever for upsetting the well reasoned award passed by the Reference Court after due consideration of the material produced by the parties.
3.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned order rendered by the High Court is set aside and award dated 20th August, 1990, passed by the Reference Court is restored. No costs.
Appeal allowed
