State of Tamil Nadu and Others v K. V. Seshadiri and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 January 1988
C.A. No. 274 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. We find that the learned Chief Justice of the High Court of Madras had recommended to the State Government to put the Personal Assistants and the Judgment Writers attached to the judges at par with the Reporters in the Legislative Assembly in regard to payability of the special pay of Rs.100 per month in addition to pay. While disposing of the writ petition, the High Court had directed that the respondents would get special pay of Rs.100 in addition to the special pay which they have been receiving already.
2.   This obviously was not the recommendation of the learned Chief Justice. On the basis of the recommendation the respondents become entitled to Rs.100 as by way of special pay and Mr. Shanti Bhushan appearing for State has no objection to accept that part of the decision relating to monthly payment of Rs.100 as special pay to each of the respondents.
3.  We accordingly modify the decision of the High Court and direct that the special pay admissible to the respondents shall be confined to Rs.100 per month from April 1, 1984. It is open to the respondents to give any further representation they like to make in this regard and if an when made the same may be disposed of on its own merit.
The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
