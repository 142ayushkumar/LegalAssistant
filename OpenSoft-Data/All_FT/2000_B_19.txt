Vice-Chancellor, Utkal University and Another v Babaji Charan Rout and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 August 2000
C.A. No. 4444 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Respondent 1, herein, claimed to have been recruited as a daily wager through a Selection Committee and in the select list, his position was shown at Sl. No. 25. In the year 1996, a seniority list was prepared in pursuance of the directions of the High Court wherein Respondent 1 was shown at Sl. No. 32. Respondent 1, thereafter, filed writ petition - O.J.C. No. 1196 of 1996 before the Orissa High Court. The Division Bench of the High Court directed the appellants herein to consider the question of absorption of the respondents as well as other daily wagers as per the gradation list in a phased manner. Since no action was taken by the appellants, Respondent 1 was compelled to file another writ petition OJC No. 12763 of 1996 seeking relief for regularisation in service. In para 4 of the counter-affidavit filed by the University in the High Court, it was stated that Selection Committee on 14-6-1985 prepared a panel whereby 29 names in order of preference were recommended for appointment and the name of Respondent 1 was shown at Sl. No. 25.
2. It was also stated in the counter-affidavit that the gradation list that was prepared in the year 1996, the name of Respondent 1 was shown at Sl. No. 32. Before the High Court, learned counsel representing the appellants stated that it was due to some mistake. Under such circumstances, the High Court by an order dated 20-1-1998 directed the appellants herein to regularise the services of the writ petitioner who is Respondent 1 in this appeal. Against that said judgment, the appellants are in appeal before us.
3.  It is admitted that consequent upon the judgment under appeal, the appellants have regularised the services of Respondent 1 w.e.f. 9-3-2000. In view of the fact that the services of Respondent 1 has already been regularised inasmuch as under law, his services were also required to be regularised, we are not inclined to interfere with the order of the High Court to the extent it directed to regularise the services of Respondent 1.
4.  The only question which is disputed is whether the name of Respondent 1 ought to be at Sl. No. 25 or at Sl. No. 32. So far as this question is concerned, Respondent 1 may make a representation before the authority concerned which we hope the same would be decided by the authority.
5.  With these directions, the appeal stands disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
