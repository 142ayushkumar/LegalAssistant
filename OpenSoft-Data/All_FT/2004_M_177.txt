3.  In FIR No. 26 of 2002 the petitioner was granted bail on 30-5-2002. An application for cancellation of bail was filed on the ground that the petitioner had threatened the complainant with dire consequences. This application was dismissed by the High Court on 23-8-2002. After the registration of FIR No. 293 of 2002 a second application for cancellation of bail was filed. Application for cancellation of bail as well as application for grant of bail in FIR No. 293 of 2002 were taken up by the High Court on 7-5-2003. Relying upon a decision of this Court in Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh 2002 Indlaw SC 1792002 Indlaw SC 179 the bail granted in FIR No. 26 of 2002 was cancelled. Prayer for grant of bail in FIR No. 293 of 2002 was declined by the same order.
4.  Aggrieved against the aforesaid order of the High Court, the petitioner filed the present special leave petition seeking bail. It was contended that he had already undergone more than fourteen months of imprisonment as under trial prisoner and therefore he should be shown mercy and released on bail.
5.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, this Court on 6-10-2003 granted bail temporarily to the petitioner for a period of four months subject to his furnishing a bail bond in an amount of Rs. 10,000 with one solvent surety of like amount in each of the two cases i.e. FIRs Nos. 26 of 2003 and 293 of 2002 respectively of Police Station Gandhi Nagar and Shipra Path, Jaipur to the satisfaction of the trial court. He was directed to report at Police Station Gandhi Nagar once in every fortnight. It was made clear in the order that if the petitioner misuses the liberty given to him his bail application would be liable to be cancelled. The case was ordered to be listed after fourteen weeks.
6.  The respondent State filed Crl. M.P. No. 714 of 2004 in the instant special leave petition for cancellation of the temporary bail given to the petitioner on the ground that he had misused the liberty granted to him. It was alleged that he had grossly abused his liberty by entering in a conspiracy and getting one Rajendra Kumar Jain assaulted who had bought shops/properties from the petitioner and his family. In this regard FIR No. 451 of 2003 dated 27-11-2003 under Sections 341, 323, 308 and 120-B IPC has been registered at Police Station Bajaj Nagar, Jaipur. As per medical report, apart from the simple injury Rajendra Kumar Jain had received two grievous injuries as well.
7.  Crl. M.P. No. 714 of 2004 is taken up with the special leave petition for disposal.
8.  On the asking of the Court the learned counsel for the respondent State produced the case diaries in FIR No. 451 of 2003. On a perusal of the contents of FIR No. 451 of 2003 and the extracts from the case diaries, we are prima facie satisfied that the petitioner has misused the liberty granted to him by this Court on 6-10-2003. Without expressing any opinion on the merits we deem it appropriate to cancel the temporary bail granted to the petitioner on 6-10-2003. He is directed to surrender to the authorities concerned forthwith.
9.  Accordingly, Crl. M.P. No. 714 of 2004 is allowed and temporary bail granted to the petitioner is cancelled. The petitioner shall be rearrested forthwith. As a consequence thereof the special leave petitions are dismissed.
10.  The next date for recording of the remaining evidence before the trial court is 11-3-2004. The trial court is directed to dispose of the case without granting any adjournments of long duration. The case should be disposed of expeditiously and preferably within a period of two months and if need be, by taking up the case on day-to-day basis. Nothing stated herein shall be taken as an expression of opinion on merits of the accusation of the petitioner.
Petition dismissed.
