The Order of the Court was as follows :
Civil Appeals Nos. 332-51 of 2000
1.  In this batch of appeals, the scope of Section 51-A of the Land Acquisition Act arises for consideration, with particular reference as to whether it is necessary, before placing reliance upon a certified copy of a registered sale deed(s), to disclose the guideline or yardstick for fixing up the market value of an acquired land, to examine anyone connected with the said sale deed(s) or the transaction covered by it, as a condition precedent.
2.  In the decision in Land Acquisition Officer & Mandal Revenue Officer v. V. Narasaiah2001 Indlaw SC 20254 rendered by a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court, as could be seen, on perusal of paras 16 and 17, it has been held that even without examining persons connected with the transactions mentioned therein, a particular certified copy of the sale deed could be relied upon in evidence on being marked and such a consequence would inevitably follow from the very language of Section 51-A of the Act.
3.  In State of Haryana v. Ram Singh2001 Indlaw SC 20100 applying the above principle, a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court has taken a similar view. But, unfortunately, the decision in Meharban v. State of U. P. 1997 Indlaw SC 1199 rendered by a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court taking a different view has not been specifically referred to or overruled, in the latest decision in Narasaiah 2001 Indlaw SC 20254 (supra).
4.  Having regard to all this, we consider it appropriate and necessary to direct the Registry to place these matters before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for the purpose of placing the matters before an appropriate larger Bench for deciding this issue and give a quietus to the controversy, finally.
Rest of the matters be listed on 12-9-2002.
Order Accordingly
