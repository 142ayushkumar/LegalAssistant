Uday Singh and Anr v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.21238/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that observation of the High Court with a right of appeal available under Section 6 of the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 is fallacious because the said action envisages an appeal only against the order passed under Section 5 of the Act. Learned counsel submits that petitioner would be advised to move the High Court for review of the impugned order.
2. In view of the course to be adopted, learned counsel seeks permission to withdraw this Special Leave Petition. Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
