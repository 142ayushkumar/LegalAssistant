Supreme Court of India

12 April 2006

The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. 1 The point involved in the present case is whether sections 80HH and 80-1 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, are independent of each other and therefore a new industrial unit can claim deductions under both the sections on the gross total income independently or that deduction under section 80-I can be taken on the reduced balance after taking into account the benefit taken under section 80HH.
2. 2 The Madhya Pradesh High Court in/.P.Tobacco Products P.Ltd.v.CIT, took the view that both the sections are independent and, therefore, the deductions could be claimed both under sections 80HH and 80-1 on the gross total income. Against this judgment a special leave petition was filed in this court which was dismissed on the ground of delay on July 21, 2000. The decision in/.P.Tobacco Products P.Ltd.
3. 3 Since the special leave petitions filed against the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court have been dismissed and the Department has not filed the special leave petitions against the judgments of different High Courts following the view taken by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, we do not find any merit in this appeal.
4.   The Department having accepted the view taken in those judgments cannot be permitted to take a contrary view in the present case involving the same point. Accordingly, the civil appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
