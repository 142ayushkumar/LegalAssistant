Sharad Bansilal Vakil v Cibatual Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 August 1996
C.A. No. 3011 of 1980
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. This is an appeal by the learned counsel who appeared for the Union of India in a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court filed against the Union of India by the first respondent. The appeal is necessitated by observations in the judgment under appeal which are of a personal nature. We do not think that we should reproduce the same.
2. It would appear that in the course of his argument the learned counsel was somewhat more emphatic than the High Court would have wished, but the observations were not called for.
3. Needless to say, the appeal is not contested.
4. The appeal is allowed. The observations against the appellant personally in the paragraphs of the judgment aforementioned are set aside and shall be deemed to stand deleted.
5. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
