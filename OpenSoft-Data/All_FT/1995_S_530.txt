Prakash Marotirao Shere v State of Maharashtra and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 November 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. By our order dated October 30, 1995, we directed the Government to appoint an administrator. We are informed that pursuant to the said order, the administrator came to be appointed and he took charge on 1st November, 1995. We are also informed that pursuant to our observations, election process was set in motion. Objections to the preliminary voters list are to be considered by tomorrow and thereafter, depending on the order to be passed, the competent authority required to finalise the voters list on or before December 30, 1995. It is required to notify the election process on or before January 2, 1996 under Rule 16 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Election Committee Rules, 1971. The entire process of election is to be completed within a period of 45 days.
2.  We hope and trust that the competent authority would continue the election process schedule hereinbefore mentioned and would conduct the election of the Society as expeditiously as possible without any delay unless he is prevented by any order of the Court or the authorities in that behalf.
3.  The administrator would continue in office till the elections are over and the elected committee takes over the management.
4.  Shri Dushyant Dave, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants seeks to contend the correctness of the action taken against them on several legal grounds. Since the administrator has already been appointed, we are of the view that the issues raised have become academic. Therefore, we are not expressing any opinion on merits. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.
