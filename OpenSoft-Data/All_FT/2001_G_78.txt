Jagdish Chandra (Dead) By LRs and Anr v Gokul Chandra(Dead) By LRs and Anr
Supreme Court of India

19 September 2001
C.A. No.2743/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The plaintiff-respondents herein filed a suit for declaration. The suit was decreed. Aggrieved, the defendant-appellants herein preferred a First Appeal before the High Court. It appears that the High Court issued notice on the said appeal. Subsequently, the appeal was listed before the Court with the report that the defendant-appellants had not taken steps for service.
2. It further appears that the counsel for the appellants did not appear in the case and, therefore, the High Court dismissed the appeal on account of non-prosecution.
3.  Subsequently, defendant-appellant No. 1 died and, therefore, defendant-appellant No. 2 moved an application for substitution. On that application the High Court issued notice to the legal representatives of defendant-appellant No. 1. While the substitution application was pending, defendant-appellant No. 2 came to know that the entire appeal has been dismissed for non-prosecution. It is under such circumstances the defendant-appellant filed an application for restoration of the appeal along with the application for condonation of delay. The High Court dismissed the applications. It is against the said order, the defendant-appellants are in appeal before us.
4.  We have heard counsel for the parties and are satisfied that the appellants had made out a sufficient cause for condonation of delay as well as recall of the order dismissing the appeal in default.
5. We, therefore, after condoning the delay, set aside the order dated 20th July, 1989 under challenge and send the matter back to the High Court to decide the appeal on merits.The appeal is allowed with costs quantified at Rs.2, 500/- payable by the appellants to the respondents.
Appeal allowed.
