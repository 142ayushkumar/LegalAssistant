Anan T Sing H v Sta T E Of M.P .
Supreme Court of India

5  May  2008
CRIM I N A L A P P E A L NO. 8 0 5 OF 2 0 0 8(Arising out of SL P (C rl.) No. 5 8 9 0 / 0 6 )
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. This Appeal has been filed against the order of the High Court rejecting the appellant's application for grant of bail on the ground that nothing new had transpired since the dismiss al of the earlier bail application.
There is no dispute that the appellant was convicted u/s. 302 with the aid of S. 14 9 on account of the fact that he was present at the time when the incident took place and was also carrying firearms.
3. However, it also appears that apart from the above, there is no other specific role which has been attributed to him in the matter.
These observations are being made only for the purpose of considering the appellant's application for grant of bail. We are informed that the appellant has been in jail since 30th September, 1997 , and there is no likelihood of the appeal being heard by the High Court.
4. In such circumstances, the appellant be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Trial Court and we also request the High Court, if possible, to expedite the hearing of the appeal and dispose of the same as expeditiously as possible. The Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of
