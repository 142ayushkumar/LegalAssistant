Kadhar Naina Ushman v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

4 March 2003
W.P. (Cr.) No. 100 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India has been filed seeking quashing of order of detention dated 23rd October, 2001 passed by Government of Tamil Nadu under Section 3(1) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (for short 'COFEPOSA') with a view to preventing the petitioner from smuggling goods in future. The aforesaid order was modified in terms of G.O. No. SR. 1/1155-21/2001 dated 9th April, 2002. The necessity to modify the order dated 23rd October, 2001 arose on account of the surrender of the petitioner before the Magistrate and his subsequent remand to the Central Prison, Chennai.
2.  The facts, in brief, are that the petitioner was apprehended on 22nd August, 2001 while attempting to smuggle out of India foreign currency. He was arrested on 24th August, 2001. The application for release on bail on medical grounds filed by the petitioner was rejected by the concerned Magistrate on 27th August, 2001 and by Sessions Judge on 28th August, 2001. The petitioner was, however, released on bail in terms of the order of the High Court dated 30th August, 2001. The grant of bail, to the petitioner, was not opposed by the public prosecutor before the High Court. The petitioner was directed to be released on bail by the High Court on his executing a bond for Rs. 10,000/- with two sureties for a like sum each.
3. It appears that on furnishing the bail bond and the sureties the petitioner was released on bail. On 3rd April, 2002, however, brother of the petitioner who was one of the surety, withdrew his surety, the petitioner did not give alternative surety and was arrested and remanded to judicial custody. The modified order of detention was served on the petitioner while in custody.
4.  Various grounds have been pleaded to challenge the order dated 23rd October, 2001 and 9th April, 2002. It is not necessary to consider those grounds except the ground of delay in execution of the order of detention. According to the petitioner the detaining authority was not serious in detaining him as no attempt, much less any serious attempt, was made for long period after the passing of detention to execute that order. It is well settled that delay in execution of the order of detention would not by itself invalidate the order of detention and would not show that the detaining authority is not serious in detaining the detenu. It is open to the detaining authority to offer satisfactory explanation and place before the court the attempts made to execute the order of detention. In case satisfactory explanation is given the delay in execution would become inconsequential.
5.  In the present case, as already noticed, the detention order was executed on 9th April, 2002. It was passed on 23rd October, 2001 and modified on 9th April, 2002. Earlier to 23rd October, 2001, the petitioner had been released on bail in terms of the order of the High Court dated 30th August, 2001. The respondent - State of Tamil Nadu, in the counter affidavit, filed by its Deputy Secretary, has stated that the detention order dated 23rd October, 2001 could not be executed as the petitioner went in hide and was absconding all the time and action was taken under Section 7(1)(b) of the COFEPOSA on 7th February, 2002. It has also been stated that all efforts taken by the police to implement the detention order proved futile as the detenu was absconding to evade arrest. Except these general and vague averments, no particulars have been mentioned in the affidavit. There is nothing in the affidavit which could show as to what efforts were made between 23rd October, 2001 and 7th February, 2002.
6. In absence, this Court is constrained to take the view that no efforts were made for nearly 3 1/2 months i.e. between 23rd October, 2001 and 7th February, 2002 to apprehend the petitioner. It is also not the case of the respondents that any application was filed before the Magistrate either praying for the cancellation of the bail or praying that the petitioner shall not be granted exemption from personal appearance since he is evading arrest pursuant to the order of detention. Clearly, therefore, the respondents have miserably failed to offer any explanation let alone a satisfactory explanation in respect of delay in execution of the order of detention. The inevitable conclusion is that the respondents were not serious in detaining the petitioner under the preventive law of COFEPOSA.
7.  For the aforesaid reasons, the order of detention dated 23rd October, 2001, as amended on 9th April, 2002 is quashed. The petitioner is directed to be released forthwith if not required in any other case. The Writ Petition is allowed accordingly.
Petition allowed.
