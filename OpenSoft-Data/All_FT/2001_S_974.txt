Jaysingh Wadhu Singh v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

9 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2364/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr. KTS Tulsi, learned senior counsel submitted that petitioner would be advised to raise these questions before the Trial Court at the appropriate stage since this Court by the order dated 17.8.2001 in SLP(Cr)No.2188 of 2001 granted permission to the petitioner to raise all such questions over again, untrammelled by the impugned order.
2. As the said permission was granted in the afore-cited order we make it clear that the petitioner will have the same permission in regard to the contentions raised in these bail applications. At this stage, Mr. KTS Tulsi, learned senior counsel requested for permission to withdraw this SLP. It is accordingly dismissed as withdrawn.
3.  It is needless to say as the petitioner is in custody the Trial Court shall adopt steps for expeditious disposal of the case.
Order accordingly.
