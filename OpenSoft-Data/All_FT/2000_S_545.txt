State of Madhya Pradesh and Another v Idol Shri Ram Mandir of Village Sardarpur
Supreme Court of India

8 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.1230/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The trial court decreed the respondent's suit holding the temple to be private temple. The appeal was dismissed by the appellate court being barred by time.
2.  The High court also dismissed the second appeal summarily without entering into any question.
3.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we find the delay for which appeal was dismissed was only 25 days. Learned counsel for the respondent attempted to show that the explanation was not justified and hence the dismissal by the appellate court could not be said to be illegal. However, looking to the issue in this case and the period of delay, even on the facts and circumstances of this case, we feel that the appellate court should not.
4.  Have dismissed the appeal on the ground of it being barred by time. Another submission raised by the learned counsel for the respondent is, as rejection of application by the appellate court, not condoning the delay is not a decree, hence no second appeal arises. It is not necessary to enter into this question on the fact of this case. However, we may record when the application is rejected not condoning the delay consequently even unnumbered appeal was also dismissed.
5.  Accordingly, the present appeal is allowed. The impugned judgments of both, the High Court and first appellate court are set aside. The case is remanded back to the Additional District Judge, Sardarpur to decide the appeal afresh treating it as not barred by time after giving opporltunities to the parties.
6. However, we award costs of Rs. 2,000/- on the appellant. The amount to be deposited in the first appellate court which may be withdrawn by the respondent.
Appeal allowed.
