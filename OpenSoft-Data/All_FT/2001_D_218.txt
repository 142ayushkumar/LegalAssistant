Supreme Court of India

7 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4452/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Upon hearing the submissions made on behalf of the parties, we do feel it expedient that the matter in issue be remanded back to the High Court for being disposed of on merits. Mr. L. Nageswara Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners in SLP(C) No.4452/2000, states, on instructions, that his client will not take the plea of limitation before the Appellate Court. The appeal being Appeal No.153/1986 be heard along with the judgment and order dated 3.5.1985 as modified on 17.6.1985. It is ordered accordingly.
2. Since the matter is pending for quite some time, the High Court would do well to dispose of the appeal within a period of six months from the date of communication of the order.
3.  Application for deletion of the names of respondent Nos.5 to 19 is allowed.
4.  The special leave petitions stand disposed of at the admission stage itself with the aforesaid observations.
Petitions disposed of.
