Chiranjilal (Dead) By Lrs. v Hari Das (Dead) By Lrs.
Supreme Court of India

5 October 2004
C.A. No. 3745 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we find there is obvious conflict among the three two-Judge Bench decisions i.e.
(i) Shankar Balwant Lokhande v. Chandrakant Shankar Lokhande1995 Indlaw SC 393,
(ii)  W.B. Essential Commodities Supply Corpn. v. Swadesh Agro Farming and Storage (P) Ltd.1999 Indlaw SC 1516, and 
(iii) Hameed Joharan v. Abdul Salami 2001 Indlaw SC 21137.
2. Yet another two-Judge Bench decision in Renu Devi v. Mahendra Singh 2003 Indlaw SC 183 would also have some bearing on the point.
3.  In this view of the matter, we deem it appropriate that this case be placed before a three-Judge Bench to resolve the conflict in the aforesaid decisions.
May be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate orders.
Order accordingly.
