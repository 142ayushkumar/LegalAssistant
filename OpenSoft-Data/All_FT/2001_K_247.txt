Kundan Mal and Others v State of Rajasthan
Supreme Court of India

20 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1514/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned in SLP(Crl) 2361/2001.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The impugned order passed by the High Court does not call for any interference. Hence, special leave petitions are dismissed.
2. However, it would be open to the petitioners to raise all the contentions during the trial. It would also be open to the petitioners to apply to the trial court for granting exemption from appearance. The trial court would consider the same and as far as possible grant such exemption on such terms and conditions which would not in any way delay the trial. In any case, with a condition that on behalf of the accused, Advocate would remain present on the date of posting of the matter and the Advocate would not seek adjournment on the ground that he is not having proper instructions.
Petitions dismissed.
