State Of U.P. v Shiv Singh Yadav & Ors.
Supreme Court of India

16 February 2009
TRANSFER PETITION (C.) NOS.821-825 OF 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard both sides.
1.  28 housing plots were allotted by the Lucknow Development Authority. Some of the persons, who have not been given allotment, filed writ petitions pointing out certain irregularities committed by the Lucknow Development Authority. We are told that those Writ Petition Nos. 7040, 7577, 7327, 7519 and 7576 of 2007 are now pending before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, Bench at Lucknow. Meanwhile, for cancellation of 28 plots and for constitution of Enquiry Committee, another public interest litigation was filed by one Vishwanath Chaturvedi before this Court being Writ Petition (C) No. 445/2005 and the same is pending consideration. As these writ petitions, which are pending in the Lucknow Bench are similar to the Writ Petition pending before this Court and relate to the same issue, to avoid conflicting decisions being taken on the same set of facts, we direct that all the above writ petitions i.e. W.P. Nos. 7040, 7577, 7327, 7519 and 7576 of 2007 be transferred to this Court. The order be communicated to the Registrar General of the Allahabad High Court, Bench at Lucknow and the records be sent to this Court at an early date.
The transfer petitions are allowed accordingly.
