Ink Master Private Limited v Collector of Central Excise, Calcutta
Supreme Court of India

10 September 2002
C.A. No. 1591 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Ms. Sumita Goel, learned counsel for the appellant, submits that the advocate on-record had received instructions from his Kolkata office that inspite of repeated reminders, the clients are not responding as they have closed their company and settled in England forever. On the basis of this letter, learned counsel for the appellant has filed I.A. No. 4 of 2002 for discharge from the case as advocate on-record.
2. In view of these facts, we allow the interlocutory application and permit the advocate to withdraw from the case.
3.  In as much as the appellant's whereabouts are not known, the question of issuing notice to them does not arise.
We, accordingly, dismiss the appeal for non-prosecution.
Appeal Dismissed.
