Neelam Mann v Charanjit Singh Mann
Supreme Court of India

13 July 2005
C.A. No. 3638 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 12377 of 2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The decree of divorce by mutual consent granted by the Matrimonial Court was set aside by the learned Single Judge of the High Court in appeal on the ground that contrary to the provisions of Section 13-B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the decree was erroneously passed without expiry of the waiting period to be granted to the spouses to stand by the joint petition for mutual divorce.
2.  Against the order passed by the learned Single Judge, the husband preferred a letters patent appeal to the Division Bench of the High Court. By the impugned order, the Division Bench of the High Court, stayed the operation of the entire judgment of the learned Single Judge of the High Court and directed that the appeal will be set down for hearing within one year.
3.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we find that the impugned order of the Division Bench of the High Court is palpably erroneous. On an application for stay, the Division Bench ought not to have stayed the whole judgment with adverse consequences against the wife.
4. It is also not correct on the part of the Division Bench to have fixed a period of one year for hearing of the appeal disregarding the provisions of Section 21- B which allows six months' period for trial of the petitions.
5.  For the reasons aforesaid, the appeal is allowed. The impugned order of the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside. The case is sent back to the High Court to expeditiously decide the letters patent appeal on merits within a period of six months.
Appeal allowed.
