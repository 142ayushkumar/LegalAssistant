State of Punjab Through Secretary, Home v Subhash Kumar and others
Supreme Court of India

6 August 2004
Cr.A. No. 806 of 2004 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 2905 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  By the impugned order, the High Court has quashed FIR No. 55 dated 27-4-2001. The FIR was registered against four respondents for having committed theft of cheel logs from the forest of Kukanet. In sum and substance, the allegation is of illegal felling of trees and theft of the same from the forest. Curiously, the High Court by entering into the factual arena has passed the impugned order quashing the FIR. Such a course is wholly impermissible. The High Court acted more as an investigating agency at a stage when the FIR was under investigation. At this stage, we wish to say no more lest it may prejudice the parties.
2. For the aforesaid reasons, we allow the appeal and set aside the impugned order. The investigation should continue in accordance with law.
Appeal allowed.
