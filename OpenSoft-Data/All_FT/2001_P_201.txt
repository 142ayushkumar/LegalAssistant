Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17467/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the interim order passed by the High Court, on the facts of this case, ought not to have been passed because that had the effect of really allowing the writ petition of the respondents.
2.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal and set aside the interim order dated 10.10.2000 of the High Court.
3. The High Court is requested to dispose of the writ petition of the respondents at an early date.
Appeal allowed.
