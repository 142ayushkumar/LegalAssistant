Mehsana Dist. Co-Op. Milk P.U. Ltd. v Union Of India
Supreme Court of India

31 March 2003
C.A. No. 2668 of 2003, Dt. 31 March 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The issue here relates to the order passed by the Commissioner (Appeals), Central Excise and Customs, under Section 35F of the Central Excise Act, 1944. By the impugned order, the appellants have been directed to deposit an amount of Rs. 30 lakhs by way of pre-deposit. The reasoning given in support of such order is wholly unsatisfactory. The appellate authority has not at all considered theprima faciemerits and has concentrated upon theprima faciebalance of convenience in the case. The Appellate Authority should have addressed its mind to theprima faciemerits of the appellants' case and upon being satisfied of the same determined the quantum of deposit taking into consideration the financial hardship and other such relevant factors.
2. We accordingly set aside the decision of the High Court as well as the impugned order dated 14-8-2002 and remand the matter back to the appellate authority for redetermining the issue under Section 35F of the Act after affording an opportunity of hearing to the parties. The appeal is allowed without any order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
