Manjit Singh Grewal Alias Gogi v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 March 1989
Cr.A. No. 168 of 1989
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  This an appeal from the decision of the High Court of Delhi, dated November 30, 1988. The High Court dismissed the criminal writ petition on the ground that there was no violation of the procedural safeguards in this case. The appellant has been detained under an order dated June 9, 1988 under Section 3 (1) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange & Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974
2.  It appears that the appellant had asked for certain copies of the documents which admittedly were there with the respondent - Union of India. Copies of the documents were supplied, but the same were not legible.
3.   This position is also apparent. It is not necessary in the facts of this case to go into the question whether these documents were relevant or material.
4.  In view of the fact that the copies of the documents were, in fact, supplied at the request of the appellant, but the copies supplied were illegible, we are of the opinion, that the safeguards provided by the Constitution have not been followed.
5.    In that view of the matter the decision of the High Court cannot be sustained and, therefore, is set aside. The order of detention dated June 9, 1988 is quashed and the appellant be set at liberty unless he is required in respect of any other proceedings.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal Disposed of.
