Krishi Upaj Mandi Samiti Sagar (M.P.) v Pradeep K. Verma and Another
Supreme Court of India

8 November 2000
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3807 OF 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having heard learned Senior Advocate for the appellant, we think this is a fit case in which we should not interfere with the order made by the High Court affirming the award made by the tribunal with certain modifications in the award made by the Labour Court.
2.  Certain contentions have been urged on behalf of the appellant but it is not necessary to make any detailed examination. Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant submits that so far as the question whether the appellant is an industry or not is now concluded by a decision of this Court in Agricultural Produce Market Committee Vs. Shri Ashok Harikuni and Anr. etc. and, therefore, it is unnecessary to examine this aspect of the matter.
3.  So far as the question whether the services of respondent No. 1 could have been put to an end to in the circumstances pointed out, we think it is unnecessary to re- examine the matter when the Labour Court has fully examined this question on the facts arising in the case.
4.  In that view of the matter, we think it is unnecessary to interfere with the order made by the High Court affirming the award made by the tribunal, in the special features of the case.
The appeal stands thus dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
