Lakshmi Ammal v Madhavakrishnan (K. N.) And Ors
Supreme Court of India

7 August 1978
Civil Appeal No. 1264 of 1978. Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 11-8-1976. Of the Madras High Court in CRP. No. 2084/76
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1. It is unfortunate that long years have been spent by the courts below on a combat between two parties on the question of court fee leaving the real issues to be fought between them to come up leisurely. Two things have to be made clear. Courts should be anxious to grapple with the real issues and not spend their energies on peripheral A ones. Secondly, court fee, if it seriously restricts the rights of a person to seek his remedies in courts of justice, should be strictly construed. After all access to justice is the basis of the legal system. In that view, where there is a doubt, reasonable of course, the benefit must go to him who says that the lesser court fee alone be paid.
2. In this particular case there is hardly any difficulty in holding that the plaintiff in paragraph 14 of the plaint has clearly alleged that sh., is in joint possession and is seeking partition and separate possession of her half share in the suit properties as heir of deceased, Paramayee. Obviously, the court fee that is payable is as she has claimed, namely under sec. 37(2) which corresponds to Art. 17(b) of the  which is the predecessor legislation on the subject. We allow the appeal and send the case back to the trial court and direct that court to proceed with the suit expeditiously.
3. We make it clear that our decision on the question of court fee does not have any implications on the merits including the validity or otherwise of the Will. No costs.
