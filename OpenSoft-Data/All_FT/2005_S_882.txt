Punjab State Electricity Board v Swaran Singh
Supreme Court of India

7 January 2005
C.A. No. 203 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 14395 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
We have heard counsel for the parties.
1.  The High Court by its impugned judgment and order dated 8.05.2003 upheld the order passed by the first appellate court finding the plaintiff-respondent herein entitled to regularisation of his services. The High Court was impressed by the fact that the respondent has been in service since August 1976 and that he had already rendered 20 years of service on the date of the filing of the suit i.e. on 31.01.1996.
2. In these circumstances, the High Court held that the petitioner-appellant Board should not contest the claim taking the shelter of technicalities. It is no doubt true that the respondent was appointed on adhoc basis on 20.08.1976 to work as a lower division clerk. In September 1978 the Board issued memorandum for regularisation of employment of certain categories of employees who were working on adhoc basis. Since the respondent was not considered to be eligible under the aforesaid memorandum, he was not regularised.
3.  Ultimately, pursuant to an advertisement issued by the Board in May 1980, only to accommodate ad hoc employees whose services could not be regularised under the various instructions of the Board, the respondent applied. This is apparent from Annexure P-3, his application pursuant to the said advertisement. It is not disputed before us that the appellant Board appointed the respondent as lower division clerk on a regular basis w.e.f. 4.08.1982.
4.  In these facts and circumstances, the order passed by the High Court does not appear to be justified because the respondent got benefit of the policy of the Board to provide employment benefits to those adhoc employees who could not be regularised under the earlier instructions. He availed of the benefits under the said policy of the Board and applied in response to the advertisement issued in May 1980. Pursuant thereto, he has been appointed on regular basis. In these circumstances, there appears to be no justification for granting regularisation to the respondent with effect from any earlier date.
5.  We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the orders of the High Court and the first appellate court and restore the judgment and order of the trial court dated 29.09.1998.
6.  We hold that the respondent shall be treated as regular employee of the Board with effect from 4.08.1982.
Appeal allowed.
