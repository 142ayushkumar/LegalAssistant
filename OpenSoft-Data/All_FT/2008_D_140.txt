Director General Of Police, Haryana & Ors v Dharmender Singh
Supreme Court of India

6 February 2008
Appeal (civil) 2688 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This appeal is preferred by the Director General of Police, Haryana against the judgment of the High Court dated April 24, 2006 passed in C.W.P. No.4916 of 2005.
2.  In view of the order that we propose to pass it may not be necessary to recite the entire facts leading to the filing of this appeal. Suffice it to say that the respondent applied for enrolment and he was not allotted belt number on the ground that the respondent was arrested in connection with FIR No.43 dated July 20, 2002 under Sections 323/341/34 IPC which fact he did not disclose in Column 11 of his application form. This matter is no more res integra. It is squarely covered by the recent judgment of this Court rendered in A.P. Public Service Commission vs. Koneti Venkateswarulu and others, (2005) 7 SCC 177 2005 Indlaw SC 509.
3.  In the result this appeal is allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed
