Jenith Mohan(Minor) Rep.By N.Mohan Kumar v Government of Tamil Nadu and Others
Supreme Court of India

28 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14459/2001

The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court dismissed the writ petition on the ground that learned counsel for the writ petitioner (also the present petitioner) fairly conceded that the matter was covered by the decision referred to in paragraph (2) of the High Court's order. As against that decision, special leave petitions have been dismissed.
2. It is now contended that, that is not a decision which applies to the present case. Having regard to the fact that, that was the concession of learned counsel for the petitioner, it is not a submission that can be accepted.
3.  As we were on the point of dismissing the special leave petition, an application was made by learned counsel for the petitioner that it should be allowed to be withdrawn so that a review petition could be filed before the High Court on the ground that this was not a decision that applied to the facts of this case. Having regard to the concession by learned counsel for the petitioner before the High Court, the application is refused.
The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
