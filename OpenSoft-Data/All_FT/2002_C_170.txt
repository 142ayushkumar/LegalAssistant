Commissioner of Income Tax v L.M.P. Precision Engr. Company Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

18 December 2002
C.A. Nos. 3720, 3721 and 4538 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The assessment years in question are 1985-86, 1986-87 and 1987-88. It is not in dispute that the assessments had in fact been completed under section 143(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Subsequently, re-assessment proceedings were completed under section 147. The Revenue sought to impose penalty under section 273(2)(aa) on the assessee in respect of the order passed under section 147.
2.  The contention of the assessee was that in view of the decision of this Court in Modi Industries Ltd. v. CIT 1995 Indlaw SC 1529, the penalty proceedings under section 273 would not lie in respect of an assessment under section 147 and that the phrase 'regular assessment' used in section 273 referred to the original assessment made under section 143(3).
3.  The Tribunal upheld the submission of the assessee. A reference was made under section 256(2) before the High Court on the following question:
"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that penalty under section 273(2)(aa) cannot be levied as it has been initiated in the re-assessment proceedings?"
4.  The High Court rejected the reference application on the ground that the issue was squarely covered by the decision in Modi Industries Ltd.'s case (supra).
5.  The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted before us that the decision in Modi Industries Ltd.'s case (supra) did not consider the question whether the first assessment in respect of escaped income under section 147 was the 'regular assessment' for the purposes of section 273. He has relied upon the provisions of section 215(6) in support of his submission that for the purpose of section 273, a regular assessment in respect of reassessment must be the order that is passed for the first time under section 147 in respect of the escaped income.
6.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee has submitted that the decision in Modi Industries Ltd.'s case (supra) must be taken to have concluded this issue as well and has pointed out several observations in the judgment of this Court which, according to him, supports this stand. It is further submitted that in any event the assessee's case was not covered by the provisions under section 215(6).
7.  We are of the view as the aforesaid submission on behalf of the parties would show that there is a question of law, which required consideration. It cannot be said on a bare perusal of the decision in Modi Industries Ltd.'s case (supra) that it has concluded the issue relating to assessments under section 147 in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue, as appears to have been assumed by the High Court.
8. We, therefore, set aside the judgment of the High Court and direct the Tribunal to draw up the statement of case and refer the question set out above, to the High Court for its opinion. It is made clear that this Court has not expressed any view on the rival contentions of the parties. The Appeals are disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
