Malkiat Singh and Another v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 February 1981
Cr.A. No. 209 of 1981.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
It appears that in this case the accused have entered into a compromise with the persons injured in the occurrence out of which this appeal arises.
Taking note of this fact and following the decision of this Court in Ram Pujan v. State of U.P. 1973 Indlaw SC 4311973 Indlaw SC 4311973 Indlaw SC 431 the High Court in effect reduced the sentence of imprisonment of the two of the appellants before it to the periods already undergone by them, but in the case of the other two who are appellants before us a different order was made.
1.  We think that the ends of justice would be met if the sentences of imprisonment passed on the appellants before us are also reduced to the periods undergone by them. We do not disturb the sentences of fine imposed on the appellants. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
