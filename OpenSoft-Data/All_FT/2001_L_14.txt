Punjab State Milk Federation and Anr v Lajpat Rai and Anr
Supreme Court of India

11 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9897/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This matter was passed over on the first call, but even on the second call the counsel is not present. There was a request by the counsel for adjourning this matter to the next week which we refused.
2.  We have examined the records ourselves. The S.L.P. has been filed against the dismissal of the second appeal in limine. The plaintiff's suit was decreed. A first appeal was filed which was dismissed against which the second appeal had been filed.
3.  Having examined the judgment of the trial Judge and the first appellate court, we do not find any infirmity therein which requires the interference by the second appellate court.
This petition under Article 136, is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
