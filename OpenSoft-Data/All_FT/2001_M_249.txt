State of Gujarat v Mayank Vinaychandra Shah and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2382-2399/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  As per the orders, impugned bail has been granted to the respondents on conditions enumerated in the order itself.
2.  Mr.Harish N. Salve, learned Solicitor General of India appearing for the State of Gujarat submitted that those conditions are quite sufficient particularly when investigation has been completed and charge-sheets have been laid before the court. But he expressed apprehension that as the accused are  persons of high influence they may adopt dilatory tactics for prolonging the trials.
3.  We make it clear that if the prosecuting agency feels that any of the accused resorts to such tactics it is open to them to move for cancellation of the bail and any such move made will be disposed of by the trial court without much delay. We hope that this rider is sufficient to take care of the apprehensions expressed by the learned Solicitor General of India.
4. The committal courts shall commit the cases as expeditiously as possible, so that, trial court can proceed further without delay. With these observations these Special Leave Petitions are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
