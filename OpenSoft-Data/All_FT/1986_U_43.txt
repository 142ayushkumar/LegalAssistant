Conscientious Group v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

12 December 1986
Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 4210 of 1986 in W.P. No. 1251 of 1986.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr. Birla states that in view of the fact that the Attorney General has stated that he is not in a position to consider this matter for the time being since he is a petitioner in the National Anthem case Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala, 1986 Indlaw SC 626, he applies for leave to withdraw.
2.   Hence the Cri. M.P. is allowed to be withdrawn with liberty to him to refile the application after obtaining consent of the Attorney General as soon as the National Anthem case Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala, 1986 Indlaw SC 626 is over.
While allowing the application to be withdrawn, we must express our view that every one is entitled to criticise the judgment of the court but no one should attack the judges who delivered the judgment as that denigrates the judicial institution and in the long term impairs the democratic process. That is something which must be avoided at all costs.
Order accordingly.
