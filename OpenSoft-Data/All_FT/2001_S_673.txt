Patel Jivaji Panaji v State of Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

10 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3786/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In view of the order passed on 19.10.2001, this special leave petition is confined to the prayer for bail of petitioner No.2 - Patel Jivaji Panaji only. On perusal of the relevant papers and on consideration of the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, we do not find that there was any cogent reason for refusing the prayer for bail of petitioner No.2.
2. The High Court, in our view, was not right in rejecting the application for bail filed by him. Accordingly, the order dated 07th August, 2001 of the Gujarat High Court in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.5763 of 2001 is set aside. The petitioner No.2 herein shall be released on bail on execution of a bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties each for the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.
The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
