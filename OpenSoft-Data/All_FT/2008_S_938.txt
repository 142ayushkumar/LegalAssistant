Supreme Court of India

17 July 2008
Special Leave Petition (C) No. 8524 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  In view of our order passed today in the case of M/s. Supreme Industries Ltd. Vs. M/s. Ranisati Pipe Industries & Ors., 2008 Indlaw SC 2336 Civil Appeal arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.8750/2007, nothing survives in this Petition filed by M/s. Farmers Tractors. The reason is that petitioners-M/s. Farmers Tractors were intervenors in the High Court. They had opposed the original Writ Petition filed by respondent No.5 herein- M/s.Ranisati Pipe Industries. Since the original Writ Petition sands dismissed as withdrawn, nothing survives in this Special Leave Petition and the same is, accordingly, dismissed as infructuous.
No orders as to costs.
