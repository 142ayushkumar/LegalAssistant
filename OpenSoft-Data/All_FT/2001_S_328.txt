Siddanath v North West Karnataka Road Trpt. Corporation
Supreme Court of India

15 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11173-11174/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  By the impugned judgment, writ appeal filed by the respondent-Corporation was disposed of by a Division Bench of the High Court, in the `same terms' in which by an earlier decision dated 25th May, 2000 Writ Petition No.3449/1998 was disposed of. It is conceded at the Bar that the facts of the case relating to the appellant before us are different from the facts which were in issue in Writ Petition No.3449/1998 and, therefore, learned counsel for the respondent-Corporation fairly conceded that the present matter should have been independently heard and decided by the High Court.
2. In view of the stand so taken, we set aside the Orders dated 3rd July, 2000 and 23rd February, 2001 passed by the High Court disposing of the writ appeal and rejecting the prayer for review.
3.  The writ appeal shall stand restored on the file of the High Court and heard and decided afresh on its own facts, after affording the parties opportunity of hearing.The appeals are disposed of. No order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
