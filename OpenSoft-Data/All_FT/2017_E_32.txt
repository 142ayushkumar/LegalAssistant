1. Leave granted.
2. When the matter was pending before this Court, we sought the assistance of Mr. R. Basant, learned senior counsel, to mediate between the parties and explore the possibility of a settlement.
3. It is heartening to note that the mediation has been fruitful and the parties have settled their disputes amicably. They have also filed a Joint Memo dated 31.07.2017. In terms of the settlement, the appellant has handed over a Demand Draft for a sum of Rs.61,00,000/- (Rupees Sixty One Lacs) to Respondent No.2, which has been duly acknowledged by the learned counsel for Respondent No.2.
4. Therefore, this appeal is disposed of in terms of settlement by way of Joint Memo dated 31.07.2017, which shall form part of this judgment.
5. In view of the settlement, as above, the appellant is permitted to withdraw the deposit made before this Court, pursuant to the order of this Court, along with the accrued interest.
6. Though Mr. R. Basant, learned senior counsel, was requested by the parties to accept some remuneration, learned senior counsel has graciously declined the request. However, since the parties have been benefited by the process, we direct both the parties to pay an amount of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) to the Supreme Court Bar Clerk's Association, within a month, which shall be equally shared between them.
7. I.A. No.2 also stands disposed of.
8. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
9. There shall be no orders as to costs.
Order accordingly
