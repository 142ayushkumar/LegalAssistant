Shiv Bahadur Singh and Others v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

9 October 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Cr.) No. 715/2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The only complaint made by the appellants in this appeal is that the Advocate whom they engaged was elevated as a Judge of the High Court, therefore, the Advocate who appeared and was heard on the date of hearing before the High Court, was neither instructed by them nor was permitted to represent them in the appeal.
2.  Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of this case we think it appropriate that the appellants should be given an opportunity of being appropriately represented in the appeal which was pending before the High Court, namely, Criminal Appeal No.410 of 1989.
3. In this view of the matter, we set aside the impugned order and remand the matter back to the High Court. The High Court now will have to hear the matter on merits without, in any manner, being inhibited by the judgment of the High Court in the impugned judgment, including the sentence passed therein.
The appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
