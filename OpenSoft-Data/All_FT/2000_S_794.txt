Basudev Mandal v State of W. B
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2000
Cr.A. No. 755 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appellant in this case was convicted under Section 302 and was sentenced to imprisonment for life on 26-9-1986. He is alleged to have murdered his mother-in-law around 7.30 a.m. on 13-7-1979. The High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence and dismissed the appeal.
2.  The case rested on circumstantial evidence. The trial court and the High Court referred to various circumstances and concluded that the circumstances have formed themselves into a completed chain. The courts relied on the testimony of PWs 2, 3 and 5 as testifying to the important circumstances.
3.  We do not find any reason to interfere with the conviction and sentence.
4. We notice also that the appellant would have been in jail for more than 14 years by now. If he was in jail for at least some time during the pre-conviction period it is for the authorities now to decide whether the time thus so far spent by the appellant in jail can be considered for his release.
With these observations the appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
