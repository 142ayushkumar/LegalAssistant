1. Leave granted.
2. In the nature of the order we propose to pass, it is not necessary to issue notice to the respondents. In all connected matters, this Court has directed the Reference Court to release 50% of the amount deposited by the State without security and the remaining 50% with security to the satisfaction of the Court.
3. That order will govern the case of the appellants as well. The High Court may adopt the same pattern in all the connected cases, so that parties do not have to unnecessarily travel to this Court.
4. In view of the above, the appeal is disposed of. No costs.
