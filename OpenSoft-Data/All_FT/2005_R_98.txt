Ram Chander and others v Sita Ram and others
Supreme Court of India

7 February 2005
C.A. No. 937 of 2005 (Arising Out of S.L.P.(C) No. 24586/2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We find that the impugned order of the High Court is very laconic and does not deal with the merits of the case. Learned counsel for the appellants states that the case of his clients is distinguishable from other cases. The order of revisional authority was of reversal of the orders of the two authorities below. In such a situation, the High Court should have gone into the merits of the case.
2.   We, therefore, set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court for a fresh decision in accordance with law after hearing the parties.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
3.  Status quo shall be maintained by the parties until further order by the High Court.
Appeal allowed.
