Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14904/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  It is conceded that no Letters Patent Appeal lies against the judgment and order passed by the learned single Judge in exercise of power under Article 227 of the Constitution.
2. In view of that matter, the appeal filed by the respondent before the High Court of Bombay was not maintainable. Under such circumstances, we set aside the judgment and order under challenge.
3.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
