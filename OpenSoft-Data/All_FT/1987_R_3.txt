R. Bejal v Messrs Triveni Structurals Limited
Supreme Court of India

29 January 1987
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 449 of 1987 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 23 September 1986 of the High Court of Delhi in Suit No. 1426 of 1983)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We are in complete agreement with the Delhi High Court regarding the interpretation of Section 20 of the Civil Procedure Code. The suit could be instituted in Delhi only if any part of the cause of action arose within the original jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court which condition is not satisfied in the present case. The High Court was, therefore, perfectly justified in returning the plaint for presentation to the proper court.
2. The special leave petition is devoid of merits and it is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
