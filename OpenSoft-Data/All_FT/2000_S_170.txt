State of Uttar Pradesh v Sheetla Prasad Srivastava and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14733/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, the State did not contest the case. The appeal filed in the High Court was accompanied by an application seeking condonation of delay.
2. The High Court has found that no reasons, much less sufficient or cogent reasons were given in that application and, therefore, rejected the application seeking condonation of delay.
3.  We have also perused the affidavit filed in support of the application seeking condonation of delay in the High Court.
We are not persuaded to take a view different than the view taken by the High Court in the matter. The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
