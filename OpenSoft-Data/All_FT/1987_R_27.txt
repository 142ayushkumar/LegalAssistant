Rai Singh v State (Delhi Administration) and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 March 1987
Cr.A. No. 135 of 1987 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri) No. 3505 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Special leave granted. We are informed that the order dated October 24, 1986 which has been passed by the High Court earlier was an ex parte order and it was inconsistent with the order passed by the Magistrate on October 21, 1986. In these circumstances the appellant was right in moving the High Court by a petition to reconsider the ex parte order and to vacate it. The High Court should have in the circumstances heard both the parties and passed an order regarding the custody of the vehicle in question during the pendency of the criminal case. The High Court was in error in refusing to hear the appellant merely because the ex parte order dated October 24, 1986 had been complied with by the appellant.
2. We, therefore, set aside the order dated November 24, 1986 and remand the case to the High Court to consider whether the ex parte order dated October 24, 1986 should be allowed to remain in operation. The status quo will continue until the High Court passes the order. We direct the High Court to dispose of the matter within three weeks. A copy of this order shall be sent to the High Court by tomorrow evening. Both the parties may appear before the Registrar of the High Court on March 20, 1987 so that the case may be fixed for final hearing before the High Court within one week thereafter.
3. We do not express any opinion on the merits of the case and also correctness of the order dated October 24, 1986.
4. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
