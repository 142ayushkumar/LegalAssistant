Spl. Deputy Collector, A.P v N. Bali Reddy and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil).../2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  For condoning the delay of 2720 days an action was moved and when that was not granted review was sought for through a highly delayed petition. When that was rejected Special Leave Petitions were filed for which also applications for condoning the delay of more than 100 days are there. Delay is galore at every stage.
2.  Evidently some officers are guilty of serious lapses or latches. We are not told of any action being taken against them. Learned counsel himself was not informed whether any action has been taken against them. This is a very unsatisfactory situation. We do not want to interfere.
Accordingly, these Special Leave Petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
