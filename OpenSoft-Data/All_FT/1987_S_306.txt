Babubhai and Others v State of Madhya Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 January 1987
C.A. No. 1239 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. This appeal arises out of Special leave granted by this Court on February 24, 1984. The appeal is directed against the order dismissing an application for restoration of a writ petition dismissed by the High Court. The writ petition was dismissed for want of prosecution. Thereafter an application for restoration of that writ petition was made.
2. The High Court found no sufficient reason to restore the writ petition, and as such dismissed the said application. Being aggrieved therefrom the appellant came up in special leave petition and thereafter having obtained leave, this appeal is pending before this Court. The appellant had filed an affidavit of one Shri Srivastava in support of the averment made by the appellant for restoration of the writ petition. The appellant had sought relief of the restoration by stating facts which the High Court found were not borne out from the record and which were not supported by the affidavit of Shri Srivastava.
3.  In these circumstances the High Court was of the opinion that it was not a fit case for setting aside the order of dismissal passed by the High Court on December 10, 1980 in Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 92 of 1980. Having perused the records and in the facts and circumstances of the case, we find no reason to interfere with the order of the High Court. In the premises this appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed, with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
