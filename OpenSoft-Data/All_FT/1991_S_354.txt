State of Maharashtra v Sukhdev Singh and Another
Supreme Court of India

29 October 1991
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  All the learned counsel appearing in the Death Reference No. 1 of 1989 and appeal are agreed that the hearing will need at least three working weeks and, therefore, it would be desirable to commence the hearing from November 12, 1991 so that these cases could be heard without break. Counsel state that in the meantime the statements regarding the evidence, etc. will also be made.
2.   We, therefore, accede to this request and direct that these matters be taken up for hearing from November 12, 1991 onwards.
3.  Mr Nimbalkar, who is appointed amicus curiae to assist this Court insofar as the charges against the accused are concerned, states that he is facing problem regarding accommodation since he comes from Pune.
4.   Counsel for the State of Maharashtra is requested to arrange for his accommodation in Maharashtra Sadan on the dates these matters are heard by this Court. We do hope that such arrangements will be made and he will be accommodated in Maharashtra Sadan along with his junior, Mr Savarkar, w.e.f. November 11, 1991 till the hearing of these matters concludes. An interim remuneration of Rs 5000 may be granted to Mr Nimbalkar as he has come to Delhi on more than seven occasions and has spent from his pocket to attend to these matters. The payment should be made to him expeditiously but in any case before November 11, 1991. On November 12, 1991 these matters will be shown as first after the miscellaneous matters.
Order accordingly.
