Director, Haryana State Lotteries Department v Suresh
Supreme Court of India

17 January 2007
Special Leave Petition (civil) 1332 of 2007 ARISING FROM 10015 of 2006
The Judgment was delivered by : G. P. Mathur, J.
Delay condoned.
1.  The special leave petition has been filed against the order dated May 31, 2006 of High Court of Punjab and Haryana, by which the writ petition filed by the petitioner herein has been admitted.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that no order on the stay application filed by the petitioner has been passed by the High Court. No material has been filed along with the special leave petition to show that the stay application filed by the petitioner has been rejected. In these circumstances, we do not consider it a fit case for interference under Article 136 of the Constitution.
3.  The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed. It is, however, made clear that it will be open to the petitioner to make a prayer before the High Court seeking stay of the award passed by the Labour Court.
Petition dismissed
