B. N. Sharma v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

27 February 1996
C.A. No. 2025 of 1978
The Judgment was delivered by: JEEVAN REDDY, J.
1.  This appeal has to be allowed following the decision of this court in CIT v. Onkar Saran and Sons 1992 Indlaw SC 1133. The question referred for the opinion of the High Court under section 256(2) of the Income-tax Act was 1977 Indlaw ORI 14
"Whether the amount of penalty imposable should have been worked out on the basis of the law in force at the time the return was filed and the delinquency of excluding the part of the income had been committed ?"
The High Court has answered the said question holding:
" Our answer, therefore, to the question is: The amount of penalty imposable is to be worked out on the basis of the law in force on the date the Income-tax Officer directed initiation of the proceeding under section 271(1)(c) of the Act."
2. It is, however, held by this court in Onkar Saran and Sons case , that in such cases it is the law obtaining on the date of the filing of the return which contains the concealment or misstatement, as the case may be, that is relevant and not the date on which the penalty proceedings are initiated.
Accordingly, the question is answered in the following words:
"The amount of penalty imposable should be worked out on the basis of the law in force at the time of filing of the return whether original and/or revised which contained the alleged concealment or misstatement."
The appeal is allowed in the above terms. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
