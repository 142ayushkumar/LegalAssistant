Hari Singh Choudhary and Others v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 December 1986
Civil Miscellaneous Petition Nos. 22009-15 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard Shri M. K. Ramamurthy for the petitioners and the learned Additional Solicitor-General for the respondents. The main contention of the petitioners is that the direction given by this Court in its judgment entitled Satyavir Singh v. Union of India has not been complied with by the appellate authority. We are inclined to agree with the petitioners' grievance that the appellate authority has not in terms complied with the directions. The learned Additional Solicitor-General has, therefore, agreed that the Appellate Authority shall re-dispose of the appeals in accordance with law and keeping the directions of this Court in the judgment referred to above in view while dealing with the matter.
2.   The re-disposal shall be done within four months from today. Civil miscellaneous petitions are disposed of accordingly. No costs. Status quo with regard to possession of official residence shall be maintained.
Petitions disposed of.
