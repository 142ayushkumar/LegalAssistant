Mohanlal Jati Amal Jati v Iswar Radha Krishna Jew Thakur and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20692/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the petitioner. We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned interim order passed by the High Court at this stage. It goes without saying that the observations and findings recorded in the order under challenge are made for the purpose of deciding the application filed under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 read with Section 94 of the Code of Civil Procedure and will not influence the Court in deciding the suit on merit.
2.  It will be open to the petitioner to move the trial court for expeditious hearing of the suit.With these observations, the SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
