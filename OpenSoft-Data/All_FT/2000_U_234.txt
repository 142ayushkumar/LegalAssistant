University Grants Commission v Sasikala and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13404/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
We have heard the counsel for the parties.
1.  In view of the orders passed by this Court on 9.4.1999 in I.A. No. 3 in W.P.(C) No. 67/1998, the High Court ought not to have passed interim orders directing the continuation of the services of the respondents.
2. We, accordingly, allow this appeal and set aside the interim orders which have been passed in favour of the respondents who have been working as Research Scientists on a tenure basis.
However, we make it clear that as long as they have worked they will be entitled to the salaries due to them. Payment, if any, be made to them within two months of the claim being made.
Appeal allowed.
