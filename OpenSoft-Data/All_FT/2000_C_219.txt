Commissioner of Income Tax v Trustees of H. E. H. Nizam's Miscellaneous Trust
Supreme Court of India

15 February 2000
C.A. Nos. 8158 to 8160 of 1995
The Judgment was delivered by: WADHWA, J.
1.  These appeals are by the Revenue against the judgment of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and pertained to the asst. yrs. 1981-82, 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85. In these appeals, the question which arises for consideration is as under:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is justified in directing the ITO to allow 7-1/2 per cent of the net income of the trust after deducting from its total income the remuneration paid to the trustees as expenditure for administering the trust under ss. 57(i) and 19(1) of the IT Act, 1961 ?"
2.  In CIT vs. Trustees of H. E. H. The Nizam's Miscellaneous Trust 1984 Indlaw AP 146 for the asst. yrs. 1971-72 and 1972-73, the Andhra Pradesh High Court considered this question and stated as under:
"In our opinion, 7-1/2 per cent of the net receipts of the income of the trust after deducting from its total income the remuneration paid to the trustees constitutes reasonable expenditure for administering the trust under ss. 57(i) and 19(i) of the Act."
3.  This judgment has not been appealed against by the Revenue. Following this judgment, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal filed by the Revenue. The Tribunal declined to refer the question to the High Court for its opinion. The High Court also dismissed the reference application filed by the Revenue under s. 256(2) of the IT Act, 1961. Aggrieved, the Revenue has come to this Court.
4. From the question itself it would appear that it is more a question of fact than a question of law. Since the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court for the earlier years reported in CIT vs. Trustees of H. E. H. The Nizam's Miscellaneous Trust (supra) has not been appealed against by the Revenue, we see no ground to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. These appeals are, therefore, dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
