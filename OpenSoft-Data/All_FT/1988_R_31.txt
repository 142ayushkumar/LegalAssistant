The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having perused the medical report and having considered the circumstances of this case, we quash the order of the High Court granting interim bail to the respondent and direct the respondent to surrender by Monday April 11, 1988 to the authorities.
2.   At the same time, we trust it will be possible for the High Court to dispose of the bail application pending before it at a very early date.
3.  We are informed that the respondent has to undergo an operation in the hospital. If any date is fixed in that behalf by the hospital authorities, an application may be made in the High Court for suitable orders enabling him to be available for operation.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
