Mohinder Singh v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.5871/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that there was no justification for transferring the appellant when he had already been placed under suspension and an inquiry was being conducted against him.
2. The transfer would be of no avail because the effect of the transfer order is not to reinstate the appellant but he will be continued under suspension and it is meaningless to transfer such an officer. If the officer had been first transferred and then placed under suspension, then it would have been a different matter altogether.
3.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal and hold that the appellant will not be transferred as long as he is under suspension. It will be open to the respondents to conduct the inquiry as expeditiously as possible. If the appellant does not cooperate, the respondents will be at liberty to hold the inquiry ex parte.
Appeal allowed.
