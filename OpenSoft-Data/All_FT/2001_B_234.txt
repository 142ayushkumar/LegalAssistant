Bipin Bihari Shukla and Others v Bacha Shukla
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19074/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court in a second appeal has interfered with the fact finding entered by the First Appellate Court on the question of undue influence, fraud etc in the execution of Ext.A-Sale Deed. It is true that the trial court has dismissed the suit and it was in reversal of the said decree that the first Appellate Court has decreed the suit.
2.  To confer jurisdiction on the High Court under section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a substantial question of law is sine qua non. We have not seen from the impugned judgment, as to whether any such substantial question of law had been formulated by the respondent when he filed the second appeal. The High Court was not bothered to see whether any such substantial question of law had arisen in the second appeal.
We, therefore, set aside the impugned judgment.
3.  The second appeal shall stand remitted to the High Court for disposal afresh according to law.
In the above terms, we dispose of this appeal.
Appeal disposed of.
