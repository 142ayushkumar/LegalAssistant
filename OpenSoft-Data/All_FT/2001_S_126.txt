Sanku Anjaneyulu v State of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

17 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 901/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  On examining the impugned judgment the Court, on being satisfied that there is total lack of materials so far as Accused No.2 is concerned, the Court had issued notice to the State to find out whether there is any material to sustain the conviction under Sections 365/109 IPC. Mr. Prabhakar appears for the State of A.P. The only material alleged to be there against Accused No.2 is that it is his car that was used for the offence in question. That itself would not be sufficient to convict a person under the charge of Sections 365/109 IPC.
2. We, therefore, set aside the conviction of Accused No.2 and acquit him of the same. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
