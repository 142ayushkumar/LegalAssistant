Jiyajeerao Cotton Mills Limited v Collector of Central Excise, Indore
Supreme Court of India

8 October 1996
C.A. No. 2685 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have read the judgment and order of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal and the notification is amended. We have also seen the meaning of the words "Controlled Cloths". Since the drill manufactured by the appellant falls outside the definition of "Controlled Cloths" it does not obtain the benefit of the amended notification
The appeal is accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
