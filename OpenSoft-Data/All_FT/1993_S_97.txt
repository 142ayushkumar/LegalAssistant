Shanker Motiram Nale v Shiolalsing Gannusing Rajput
Supreme Court of India

30 March 1993
C.A. No. 1836 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is obviously incompetent. It is against an order of a Division Bench of the High Court rejecting the application for review of a judgment and decree passed by a learned Single Judge, who seems to have retired in the meantime. It is not against the basis judgment.
2.   Order 47 Rule 7 of CPC bars an appeal against the order of the court rejecting the review.
On this basis, we reject the appeal. No costs.
I.A. No. 1/93 (Application for substitution)
3.  No orders are necessary in view of the rejection of the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
