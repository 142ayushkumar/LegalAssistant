Union Of India & Anr v Hansoli Devi & Ors
Supreme Court of India

3 October 2002
C.A. No.9477 Of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The above appeal has been filed against the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh dated 12.01.1993 in C.W.P. No.800 of 1992 where under the High Court, while allowing the writ petition and quashing the order passed by the Land Acquisition Collector made on 19.05.1992, rejecting the application for re-determination of the compensation under Section 28-A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act'), directed the re-determination of the amount of compensation payable to the claimants in this case in the light of Land Acquisition Case No.158/79, the award in which came to be passed on 5.7.1990.
2.  The objection taken on behalf of the appellant before the High Court, which did not find favour of acceptance with the learned Judges was that, after the reference court has decided another land reference No.120/79 on 21.02.1987, the very claimants sought re-determination of the amount of compensation under Section 28-A of the Act and the same was dismissed by the Land Acquisition Collector on 26.12.1988 and, therefore, it was not permissible for the respondent-claimants in this case to move another application under Section 28-A of the Act for re-determination of the amount of compensation after the reference court has decided yet another land reference case No.158/79 on 05-07-1990.
The reason which weighed with the Division Bench of the High Court seems to be that the District Court happens to have made different awards on different dates and, therefore, each one of such award will give rise to a separate cause of action, for purposes of Section 28-A of the Act.
3.  Heard Mr. N.N. Goswamy, learned senior counsel on behalf of the appellants. There was no appearance for the respondent-claimants to make any special plea against the claim made before us. The learned senior counsel, while relying upon the decision reported in 1995 Indlaw SC 1758Union of India and Anr. Vs. Pradeep Kumari and Ors.
contended that a Bench of three learned Judges in the said decision has laid down the various conditions to be satisfied, to enable any claimant seeking for re-determination of compensation by invoking Section 28-A of the Act and condition No.(vi), as noticed in  the reported decision reads as follows :
"Only one application can be moved under Section 28-A for redetermination of compensation by an applicant."
4. This decision and the conditions enumerated therein, have also been specifically noticed by the Constitution Bench which decided Civil Appeal No.9477 of 1994 etc. etc. on 12.09.2002. Though, the High Court was right in assuming to a certain extent that when there are more than one award arising out of the claims made in respect of the acquisition under the same notification, the claimants seeking redetermination may avail of anyone or other of such awards, apparently seems to have fallen into an error in over looking the fact that such scope to avail of the remedy under Section 28-A on the basis of anyone or more than one awards made on different occasions or point of time by the reference court, cannot be also for more than once. Each one of them though may provide the occasion to apply, only one application can only be made taking advantage of any one of them only.
5.  In view of the decision noticed supra, the inescapable conclusion seem to be to hold that every time a new award of the reference court is pronounced, successive applications cannot be made relying upon every one or more of them.
6.  For all the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside and the writ petition filed before the High Court by the respondent-claimant shall stand dismissed.No costs.
Appeal allowed.
