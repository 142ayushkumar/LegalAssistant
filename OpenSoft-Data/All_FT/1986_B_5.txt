Babban Pandey and Others v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 December 1986
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 12997 of 1986 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 9 July 1986 of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in C.W.J.C. No. 6082 of 1985).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The only question which has been decided is as to who are entitled to act as the trustees of the property which has been admittedly dedicated to the deity and belongs to the temple.
2.  There is no dispute that the property belongs to the deity and that the only effect of the subsequent document dated March 13, 1970 is that the wife and the daughters of the settlor have been constituted as sevaits-trustees subsequent to the death of the settlor.
3.   We wish to make it clear that the trust created in favour of the deity and the temple by registered document dated June 10, 1964 cannot and has not been revoked and that the title to the property vesting in the deity and the temple remains unaffected. The wife and daughters will be working as sevaits-trustees appointed under subsequent document dated March 13, 1970 in place of the petitioners. The only change that has taken place is in regard to the persons who will administer the trust and not in regard to the vesting of the property in the deity. With these clarificatory observations, the special leave petition will stand disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
