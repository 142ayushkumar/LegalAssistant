Shri Kamlaprasad v Central India Spg., Wvg. and Manufacturing
Supreme Court of India

12 January 1978
C.A. No. 1338 (L) of 1971
The Judgment was delivered by: V. R. Krishna Iyer, J.
1.  We heard the appeal to some extent but at an intermediate point felt that the subject-matter involved only one workman and the alleged misconduct resulting in dismissal was not so serious, although he was dismissed by the Management and his dismissal though upset by the labour court was reversed by the Industrial Court and challenged unsuccessfully in the High Court.
2. On a suggestion from us, counsel for the Management, Mr. Bobde agreed that the respondent would pay the appellant a sum of Rs. 10,000/- within one month from today as an ex gratia payment.
3.  The costs which we direct the respondent to pay the appellant, the appeal being one regarding a single workman will be assessed at Rs. 2,000/-. With these directions, we dispose of the appeal.
Appeal disposed of.
