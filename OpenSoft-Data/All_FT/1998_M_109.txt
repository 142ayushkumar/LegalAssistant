M. Satyanarayana Murthy and Others v Mandal Revenue, Officer Cum Land Acquisition
Supreme Court of India

25 August 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  There is a delay of 2 years and 321 days in filing this review petition. The explanation for the delay contained in the application seeking condonation of delay is wholly unsatisfactory and not at all reasonable. Besides, we also find that the petitioners had filed earlier also a review petition No.214 of 1995 against the same order, which was dismissed by this Court on 22.2.1995. Both in the memorandum of the review petition and in the application seeking condonation of delay, though this fact is mentioned, but the number of the review petition has been left blank and so also the date on which the same was dismissed.
2.  This shows the casual manner in which this second review petition has been filed. Recourse to successive review petitions against the same order is not permissible more so because no error apparent on the record has been brought out. It appears to us that the petitioners are unnecessarily taking liberties. The filing of the second review petition is an abuse of the process of the court. We, therefore, dismiss this review petition both on the ground of unexplained inordinate delay and on merits with Rs 5,000/- as costs. The directions with regard to disbursement of the costs shall be issued after the same are deposited in the Registry.
Petition dismissed
