Dharam Singh v Gulzari Lal and others
Supreme Court of India

19 September 2005
Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No(s). 18852/2005 in C.A. No. 2/2005
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. The question as regards the interpretation of S. 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 arises for consideration in this appeal. Our attention has been drawn to the decision of this Court in State of Maharashtra vs. Mahboob S. Allibhoy & Anr. [(1996) 4 SCC 411 1996 Indlaw SC 819], wherein a two-Judge Bench has taken the view that no appeal shall lie under S. 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act against the interlocutory order passed by the High Court stating that the words: "any order" must be read with the expression 'decision' used in the sub-section so as to exclude any interlocutory order of the High Court from the scope of the appeal.
3. However, in R.N. Dey and Ors. vs. Bhagyabati Pramanik & Ors. [(2000) 4 SCC 400 2000 Indlaw SC 278], another two-Judge Bench of this Court has held that where after initiation of a proceeding for contempt, an order is passed without discharging the rule issued under the provisions of Section 19, it would be an order or decision in exercise of its jurisdiction to punish for contempt and against such order an appeal shall be maintainable. It appears that various High Courts have taken different views on interpretation of the Judgment in Mahboob S. Allibhoy 1996 Indlaw SC 819 (supra) as some of the High Courts are of the opinion that even if a direction is issued to the contemnor by way of interlocutory order the same would attract the provisions contained in Section 19; as such an order or decision of the High Court would be in exercise of its discretion to punish for contempt. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the matter being of some importance requires consideration by a larger Bench. Accordingly, we direct that the matter may be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for necessary orders.
4. In the meantime, there shall be a stay of the operation of the order passed by the learned Single Judge.
Order accordingly
