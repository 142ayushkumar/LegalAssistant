Commissioner of Income Tax A.P.-I, Hyderabad v Messrs Srinivas Pltry. and Cattle Feeds P.Ltd
Supreme Court of India

26 March 2001
C.A. No.5390/1998
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The High Court declined to call for a reference of the following question.
"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was correct in law in treating the poultry sheds as "Plant" and thereby allowing the assessee company a higher rate of depreciation?"
2. It did so on the basis that no referable question of law arose.
3.  We are unable to agree. A question of law does arise and, therefore, it is necessary to direct the Tribunal to refer the aforestated question to the High Court for its consideration, after drawing up a Statement of Case.
Order on the appeal accordingly. No order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
