Chander Bhan v Ram Dayal
Supreme Court of India

8 September 2000
C.A. No. 4962 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This is the tenant's appeal against eviction order passed by the courts below, on the ground of bona fide need of the landlord. The decree was passed by the trial court and confirmed by the appellate court. The appellant's second appeal was also dismissed by the High Court. The ground of bona fide need is for his son for doing general merchant business at the disputed shop at Alwar. Submission for the appellant is that he is doing business at Delhi, hence this ground has no merit. This is the changed circumstance which is referred in the counter-affidavit.
2. We have considered this additional point which has been stated in the counter-affidavit, coupled with the fact also disclosed in it that now his grandsons are grown up who could look after the business at Delhi. The reason why the landlord wants his son settled at Alwar is that he has grown old and the son doing business can do both, looking after him and the business. This suit for eviction was filed in 1975. On account of delay in disposal of this case, alternatively he shifted to another place to earn his livelihood, but if his own shop is available, the reason for bona fide need on the fact of this case does not cease.
3.  On the facts and circumstances, we do not find it to be a fit case to interfere with the impugned order under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. The present appeal is accordingly dismissed. On the fact of this case, after hearing counsel for the parties we order the appellant tenant to vacate the premises by or before 31-3-2001 subject to the usual undertaking to be filed by him, in this Court, within three weeks from today. Costs on the parties.
Appeal dismissed.
