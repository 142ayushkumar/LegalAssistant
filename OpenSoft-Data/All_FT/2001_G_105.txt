Supreme Court of India

5 February 2001
IA 1 in & S.L.P.(C).../2000 (cc 3435-3437/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitions have become infructuous now in view of the subsequent developments. The High Court had directed the State Administrative Tribunal to dispose of the original applications within a time fixed.
2. Though out of the time, the State Administrative Tribunal has disposed of the original applications later. There is no need to keep these SLPs pending. The SLPs are accordingly dismissed.
3.  Mr. J.R. Reddy, learned senior counsel submitted that contempt proceedings have been initiated against the official of the State on the basis of the interim order passed by the High Court with reference to the interim order. The Tribunal has now passed final order, and hence we do not think it necessary to proceed with the contempt initiated before the High Court.
Petitions dismissed.
