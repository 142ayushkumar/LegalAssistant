Chandigarh Administration and Anr v Sabzi Mandi Rehari Farhi Asson. and Anr
Supreme Court of India

15 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)..../2000 (CC:8297)
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  There is an inordinate delay of 283 days in filing this special leave petition. In the application seeking condonation of delay - (I.A.No.1), the only explanation furnished is contained in paragraph-3, which reads thus :
"That there has been a delay in the filing of the special leave petition and the petitioner submits that the same is not deliberate but has been caused due to administrative decision to be taken at the highest level regarding filing of the special leave petition before this Hon'ble Court".
2.  This explanation is hopelessly vague. It is neither satisfactory nor even reasonable. The application seeking condonation of delay is, accordingly, rejected.
Consequently, the special leave petition is dismissed as barred by time.
Petition dismissed.
