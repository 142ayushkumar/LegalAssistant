Parvati Devi and Others v Commissioner of Police, Delhi and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 February 2000
Cr.A. No. 198 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellants moved the High Court of Delhi claiming compensation as the husband of Appellant 1 died on account of electrocution while walking on the road. That the death was on account of electric shock is established in view of the CFSL report from Calcutta. But as the appellants could not produce relevant materials indicating the negligence of any particular officer of the authority, the High Court refused to award compensation. It is against this order, the present appeal has been filed. Once it is established that the death occurred on account of electrocution while walking on the road, necessarily the authorities concerned must be held to be negligent, and therefore, in the case in hand, it would be NDMC who would be responsible for the death in question. It is found from the records that the appellant was serving as a machineman in The Statesman and was aged 54 years on the date of death, and the age of retirement is 60 years.
2. Taking these factors into consideration, we direct that the appellants, who are the legal heirs of the deceased, be awarded compensation to the tune of Rs. 1,00,000 and NDMC should pay the same within 3 months from today failing which it will carry interest at the rate of 12%. This should be in total satisfaction of the compensation for the legal heirs of the deceased.
The appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
