Addl. Commissioner Of Income Tax, Gujarat v I.M.Patel And Co.
Supreme Court of India

28 April 1992
Civil Appeal Nos. 2626- 28 of 1979
The Judgment was delivered by: Mohan, J.
1. All the three appeals can be dealt with under the common judgment since the assessment years are different while the assesses the respondent is one and the same. The three assessment years in question are 1964-65, 1965-66 and 1966-67.
2. For the year 1964-65, the assesses returned an income Rs. 48,000 while he was assessed on an income of Rs. 58,557 imposing a penalty of Rs. 9,690. For the year 1965-66, the assesses returned an income of Rs.45,000. He was assessed on an income of Rs. 52,337 together with the penalty of Rs. 6,115. For the year 1966-67, he returned an income of Rs. 51,000 while he was assessed on an income of Rs. 62,560 and a penalty of Rs. 3,915 was imposed. It requires to be stated, at this stage, that for the respective assessment years the returns, as per the statute, ought to have been filed on July 31, 1964, July 31, 1965 and July 31, 1966 respectively.
However, the assesses filed the returns for all these years on March 24, 1967. It was the filing of these belated returns which obliged the assessing authority to impose penalty as warranted u/s. 271(1)(a) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"). When the assesses questioned the correctness of the imposition of penalty by way of an appeal against the order of the Income-tax officer; the Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the same. Thereupon, the matter was taken up to the Tribunal. The Tribunal deciding in favour of the assesses referred the following question of law:
"Whether in the facts and circumstances, the tribunal in justified in law in cancelling the penalty levied on the assesses u/s. 271(1) (a) for the three assessment years 1964-65 to 1966-67".
4. Originally, the matter came up before a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court. However, the matter was referred to the Full Bench because the Division Bench found itself unable to agree with the view taken by the earlier Division Bench ruling reported in 36 STC 347 Morvi Cotton Merchants Industrial Corpn. Ltd. v. State of Gujarat 1974 Indlaw GUJ 3 and in Special Civil Application No.1059 of 1972 decided by the same Bench of July 18, 1974. In these cases, the Division Bench took the view under the provisions of S. 271(1)(a) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Under the Sales Tax Act, where also the words "without reasonable cause" have been set out in Section providing for penalty the burden is on the Revenue to prove absence of "reasonableness cause."
5. Thus, the Division Bench felt since these decisions, though related to sales tax, had a direct bearing on an interpretation of S. 271(1) (a) of the Act the reference comes to be made.
6. The Full Bench of the Gujarat High Court, after referring to the case-law, ultimately disagreed with the view expressed by the Full Bench of the Kerala High Court reported in 103 ITR 149 Commissioner of Income Tax v. Gujarat Travancore Agency 1974 Indlaw KER 25 and concluded as under:
"In the light of the above discussion, our conclusions are as follows:-
(1) Under S. 271(1)(a) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, failure without reasonable cause to furnish return in question is an ingredient of the offence;
(2) S. 271(1)(a) provides for penalty in cases where the assesses has either acted deliberately in defiance of law or was guilty of conduct contumacious or dishonest, or acted in conscious disregard of his obligation.
(3) The legal burden is on the Department to establish by leading some evidence that prima facie the assesses has without reasonable cause failed to furnish the return without the time specified in S. 271(1)(a) read with the relevant other Sections referred to in that section. Once this initial burden which may be slight has been discharged by the Department, it is for the assesses to show as in a civil case on balance of probabilities that he had reasonable cause in failing to file the return within the time specified;
(4) Mere falsity of the explanation furnished by the assesses cannot help the Department in establishing its case against the assesses at the time of imposition of penalty".
7. In view of the above discussion and in view of our conclusion, we answer the question as reframed by us as follows:
"Reasonable cause is an ingredient of the offence for which the penalty is provided and the taxing authority has prima facie to prove absence of reasonable cause in the sense that has been explained above." The matter will now go before the Division Bench for disposing of the case in accordance with law." Thereafter, the matter came before the Division Bench which held that the view expressed by the Tribunal that the assesses had shown "reasonable cause" in erroneous on the facts and in the circumstances of the case.
Accordingly, the reference was answered in the affirmative and against the revenue. It is under these circumstances, the Civil Appeals have to be preferred by the Revenue".
8. Mr. J. Ramamurthy, learned counsel appearing for the Revenue would submit that the decision of the Kerala High Court reported in 103 ITR 149 1974 Indlaw KER 25 which has been differed from the impugned judgment, which is now reported in 107 ITR 214, Addl. Commissioner of Income-tax, Gujarat v. I.M. Patel and Co. 1976 Indlaw GUJ 29001 has come to be affirmed by this Court in GUJARAT TRAVANCORE AGENCY V. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, KERALA 177 ITR 455 1989 Indlaw SC 734 SC 1989 Indlaw SC 734. further the same principle, as laid down in the above ruling of the Supreme Court, has to be reiterated in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Kalyan Dass Rastogi 193 ITR
9. Based on this Decision, the argument of learned counsel proceeds that there is a fundamental distinction between the levy of penalty u/s. 271(1)(a) as opposed to S. 271(1)(c) of the Act. The former relates to the obligation of the assesses to file a return within the due date, while the latter deals with concealment where statutory obligation has been imposed requiring the assesses to file the return within the due date. It is for him to show, should he file a belated return, a "reasonable cause"? The burden is ultimately on the assesses to plead and prove the "reasonable cause". Consequently, no 'mens rea' could arise at all. In contradistinction to this whether, it is a case of concealment of income u/s. 271(1)(c) then the question of mens rea may come in. Unfortunately, in the judgment under appeal this distinction has not been borne in mind which led to the non-application of the ratio of the Full Bench of the Kerala High Court reported in 103 ITR 149 1974 Indlaw KER 25 (Supra). It was this aspect of the matter which comes to be clarified in 177 ITR 455 1989 Indlaw SC 734 (Supra) which has subsequently been applied in 193 ITR 713 1991 Indlaw SC 443 (Supra). Thus, it is submitted that the Revenue is entitled to succeed.
10. In opposition to this, the learned counsel for the assesses drew our attention to the passages occurring in the impugned judgment, wherein the requirement of proving mens rea had come to be insisted upon. According to him there is not much of a difference between a case falling u/s. 271(1)(a) or sub-s. (1)(c).
11. We have given our careful consideration to the above submissions. We are of the view that the Revenue is entitled to succeed. As a matter of fact the very question with which we are concerned is no longer res Integra as has rightly been pointed out by Mr. Ramamurthy. In 177 ITR 455 1989 Indlaw SC 734 (Supra) Court answered the question in the following words:-
"Learned counsel for the assesses has addressed exhaustive arguments before us on the question whether penalty imposed u/s. 271(1)(a) of the Act involves the element of mens rea and in support of his submission that it does, he has placed before us several cases decided by this Court and the High Court in order to demonstrate that the proceedings by way of penalty u/s. 271(1)(a) of the Act are quasi-criminal in nature and that, therefore, the element of mens rea is a mandatory requirement before a penalty can be imposed u/s. 271(1)(a). We are relieved of the necessity of referring to all those decisions. Indeed, many of them were considered by the High Court and are referred to in the judgment under appeal. It is sufficient for us to S. 271(1)(a), which provides that penalty may be imposed if the Income-tax Officer is satisfied that any person has, without reasonable cause, failed to furnish the return of total income, and to section 276C which provides that if a person wilfully fails to furnish in due time the return of income required u/s. 139(1), he shall punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine. It is clear that in the former case what is intended is a civil obligation while in the latter what is imposed is a criminal sentence.
There can be no dispute that having regard to the provisions of s. 276(3) which speaks of wilful failure on the part of the defaulter and taking into consideration the nature of the penalty, which is punitive, no sentence can be imposed under that provision unless the element of mens rea is established. In most cases of criminal liability the intention of the Legislature is that the penalty should serve as a deterrent. The creation of an offence by statute proceeds on the assumption that society suffers injury by the Act or omission of the defaulter and that a deterrent sentence must be imposed to discourage the repetition of the offence. In the case of a proceeding u/s. 271(1)(a), however, it seems that the intention of the Legislature is to emphasise the fact of loss of revenue and to provide a remedy for such loss, although no doubt an element of coercion is present in the penalty. In this connection, the terms in which the penalty falls to be measured are significant. Unless there is something in the language of the statute indicating the need to establish the element of mens rea, it is generally sufficient to prove that a default in complying with the statute has occurred. In our opinion, there is nothing in s. 271(1)(a) which requires that mens rea must be proved before penalty can be levied under that provision."
12. In view of this, it is no longer open to argument whether any mens rea is required to be established u/s. 271(1)(a). As a matter of fact, in the subsequent decision of this Court in 193 ITR 713 1991 Indlaw SC 443 Commissioner of Income-tax v. Kalyan Das Rastogi 1991 Indlaw SC 443 squarely applied this ratio. In the result, the reference is answered in favour of the Revenue.
13. The appeals will stand allowed setting aside the judgments of the High Court and the Tribunal. The order of assessment as passed by the Assessing Authority and as confirmed by the Assistant Appellate Commissioner in relation to penalty is hereby confirmed. There shall be no order as to costs.
