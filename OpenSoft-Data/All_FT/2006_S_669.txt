Commissioner of Central Excise, Vadodara v Steelco Gujarat Limited
Supreme Court of India

19 July 2006
Civil Apeal No. 4776 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, West Regional Bench at Mumbai (for short 'the Tribunal') decided two questions of law:
(i) relating to the demand raised by the revenue of Rs. 1,19,51,387/- made by notice dated 19-4-1996 and
(ii) regarding the entitlement of the assessee to take Modvat credit of the duty on consignments of hot rolled steel coils which were paid by other manufacturers after they were cleared.
2.  This Court granted leave restricted to the demand for Rs. 1,19,51,387/- made by notice dated 19-4-1996.
3.  Without setting aside any of the findings recorded by the Commissioner (Appeals) or the original authority which framed the assessment, Tribunal taking altogether a new point which had not been taken by the assessee earlier, allowed the appeal on question No. 1. We are not satisfied with the manner in which the Tribunal has dealt with the matter.
4. In our view, a deeper consideration is required. Accordingly, we set aside the order of the Tribunal in so far as question No. 1 regarding demand of Rs. 1, 19, 51, 387/- made by notice dated 19-4-1996 is concerned and remit the case back to the Tribunal for a fresh consideration in accordance with law. Counsel for the department has rightly not challenged the question No. 2 since the leave was restricted to question No. 1 only. The findings recorded by the Tribunal on question No. 2 has attained finality.
The Appeal is allowed in the above terms. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
