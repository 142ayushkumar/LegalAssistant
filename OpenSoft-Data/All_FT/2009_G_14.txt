Supreme Court of India

23 January 2009
CRIMINAL APPEAL NOs.158-159 OF 2009
(Arising out of SLP(Crl.).637-639/09 CRLMP Nos.16878-16879 of 2008)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Delay condoned. Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Petitioner has moved an application seeking permission to compound the offence in view of compromise entered into between the parties. It has been submitted before us that the petitioner and the Respondent no.1/Complainant entered into compromise and the petitioner has paid Rs.2,25,000/- to the complainant to get withdrawal of all cases from the courts. The Respondent no.1 has agreed and signed the compromise petition. That being so, we feel that in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, it would be appropriate to set aside the impugned orders and quash the proceedings, if any. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of
