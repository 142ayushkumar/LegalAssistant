"(1) Whether in view of the provisions contained in Article 262 of the Constitution of India and Section 11 of the Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956, the suit is not maintainable?
(2) Whether, a suit for enforcement of and interim order of the Inter- State Water Disputes Tribunal (constituted under the Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956) is a suit relating to a water dispute? If yes, what is its effect?
(3) Whether, the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 13 of the Constitution of India cannot be invoked unless the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal has recorded a finding the there has been a violation of its order dated 25.6.1991 and/or 3.4.1992?

If Yes, what is its effect?

(7) What order?"
6. The parties did not desire to lead any oral evidence and the suit was set-down for hearing.
7. During the pendency of this suit, the Court was informed the efforts are being made to bring about an amicable settlement between the parties. However, no information is available with regard to the final outcome of the efforts in this behalf. Inasmuch as the suit is being referred to Constitution Bench, it is possible that in the meantime, an amicable settlement may be arrived at.
8. Having considered the submissions urged on behalf of both the parties, it appears to us that this suit involves substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the constitution and, therefore, it will be appropriate if this suit is heard and decided by a Constitution Bench of this Court.
Ordered accordingly.
Order accordingly
