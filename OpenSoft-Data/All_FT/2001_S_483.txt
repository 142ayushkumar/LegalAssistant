Kamal Ram Kumar Patwa and Anr v State Transport Appellate Tribunal and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15289/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We do not think that there is any justification for the petitioner to rely upon the decision of this Court in Mithilesh Garg & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., which was rendered in an altogether different context. The contention urged is that with the new Motor Vehicles Act coming into force, the scheme framed under the old Motor Vehicles Act stood repealed. This contention cannot be accepted.
2. On the other hand, the scope of the provisions of the new Act makes it clear that even the pending schemes can be considered under the new Act. If this is so, the new Act has no effect upon the scheme that has been framed already.
3.  We do not think that any substantial point has been urged on behalf of the petitioner.
The special leave petition is therefore dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
