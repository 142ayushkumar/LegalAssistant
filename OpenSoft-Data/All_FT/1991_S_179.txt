Dr. Dhanwanti Vaswani v State and Another
Supreme Court of India

12 September 1991
S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 461 of 1991 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 25 May 1990 of the Delhi High Court in Cr. M. (M) 127 of 1987)
The Judgment was delivered by: S. RATNAVEL PANDIAN, J.
1.  The above petition is directed against the impugned judgment and order dated May 25, 1990 of the High Court of Delhi in Cri. M (M) 127 of 1987 partly allowing the petition so far as respondent 2 Girish Kakkar is concerned and consequently quashing the criminal proceedings initiated against him by the petitioner, complainant herein, and dismissing the prayer for quashing the criminal proceedings so far as the respondents 3 to 6 before the High Court are concerned, who are not the parties to this SLP. A brief facts of the case are thus.
2.  The petitioner herein filed a complaint against 7 accused persons under Section 500 IPC on the accusation that accused 2 and 3 made imputations both by signs and visible representations as well as in writing that the petitioner/complainant is not the wife of D.M. Vaswani, intending to harm and having reasons to believe that such imputations would harm the reputation of the complainant in the eyes and estimation of relatives, friends and associates of the complainant and in the eyes of general public. Similar imputations were also made by the accused 4 and 5. Accused 6 and 7 also made similar allegations. Summons were issued to all the accused by the Metropolitan Magistrate on July 24, 1982. It appears from the impugned judgment that the above order of the Magistrate was challenged by the respondents 3 to 6 before the High Court (presumably accused 3 to 6) and D.M. Vaswani by filing a petition in Cri. M (M) 257 of 1984. In that petition, Girish Kakkar and Ram Saran (who were petitioners 1 and 2 before the High Court in Suit No. Cri. M (M) 127 of 1987 and accused 6 and 7 before the Magistrate) were not impleaded as the parties in the said petition which was dismissed.
3.   Thereafter, notice under Section 251 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was given on October 10, 1986 to all the accused persons which led to the filing of the petition before the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking quashing of the criminal proceeding and the order dated October 10, 1986 passed by the Magistrate. The learned Judge of the High Court after examining the matter in detail passed the impugned judgment.
4.  We heard the petitioner and perused the judgment and other connected documents. It is seen from the impugned judgment that Ram Saran Kakkar, who was petitioner 2 in the petition filed under Section 482 CrPC and accused 7 in the criminal proceeding died during the pendency of the matter before the High Court. According to the petitioner, a prima facie case is made out against all the accused inclusive of respondent 2 herein and the learned Magistrate has issued the summons only on being satisfied that a case punishable under Section 500 IPC has been clearly made out against all the accused persons and issued the notice under Section 251 CrPC on October 10, 1986. According to the petitioner, the facts cited in the impugned judgment are contrary to the real facts and the learned Judge has overlooked and ignored certain salient features and passed the order quashing the proceeding as against respondent 2 herein and the impugned judgment is opposed to the principle laid down by this Court in J.P. Sharma v. Vinod Kumar Jain 1986 Indlaw SC 561986 Indlaw SC 561986 Indlaw SC 56.
5.  We have meticulously examined the above contentions of the petitioner. In Sharma case, this Court after examining the ambit and scope of Section 482 of the Code has held that the question to be determined by the Code at the stage of summoning the accused is whether on the basis of the allegations in the complaint without adding or subtracting anything a cognizable offence is made out and at that stage the truth or otherwise of the allegations does not come for scrutiny.
6.  Reliance was also placed on some more decisions, namely (1) Chandra Deo Singh v. Prokash Chandra Bose alias Chabi Bose 1963 Indlaw SC 3981963 Indlaw SC 3981963 Indlaw SC 398 and (2) Nagawwa v. Veeranna Shivalingappa Konjalgi 1976 Indlaw SC 6211976 Indlaw SC 6211976 Indlaw SC 621.
7.  In fact, the learned Judge of the High Court has referred to various decisions inclusive of J.P. Sharma case and State of W.B. v. Swapan Kumar Guha 1982 Indlaw SC 2031982 Indlaw SC 2031982 Indlaw SC 203 and has come to the conclusion that the facts of the case have not disclosed the offence of defamation against respondent 2 even "taking the allegations in the complaint as correct on its fact value".
8.  In our considered opinion, impugned order of the High Court quashing the criminal proceedings against respondent 2 does not warrant interference even in the light of the principles enunciated in the decisions cited by the petitioner. In the result, the SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
