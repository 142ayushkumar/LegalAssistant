1. Leave granted.
2. The appellant approached this Court challenging the land acquisition proceedings. The main ground of challenge was that dispensation of Section 5-A inquiry was unjustified and unwarranted. However, the High Court declined to interfere with the acquisition.
3. But in the impugned order the High Court ordered that the appellant would be entitled to a plot as per Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy of the Government as submitted by Respondent Nos. 1 to 3.
4. In view of the efflux of time and intervening developments, we do not think it would be proper for this Court now to consider the matter on merits. Therefore, this appeal is disposed of directing the respondent Nos. 1 to 3 to allot and hand over a plot as per Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy of the Government within a period of twelve weeks from today. In case the same is not done within twelve weeks, the appellant will be entitled to additional compensation of Rs.1,000/- per day till it is handed over.
5. No costs.
Order accordingly
