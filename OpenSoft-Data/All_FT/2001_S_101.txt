State of West Bengal and Others v Samir Kumar Gangopadhyay and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16415/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that the impugned order by the Tribunal was passed consequent to earlier directions issued by the High Court itself.
2.  Therefore, the High Court was in error in interfering with the interim order granted by the Tribunal in this round of litigation. Having notice the said argument, we also notice the fact what persuaded the High Court to interfere in present case was the fact that for the last 20 years the concerned employees were getting the pay scale in question. Therefore, with a view to maintain the status quo, it passed the impugned order. The High Court has also requested the Tribunal to dispose of the applications expeditiously. Taking into consideration the above fact, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order.
3. However, we direct the Tribunal to dispose of the applications within three months from the receipt of this order.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
