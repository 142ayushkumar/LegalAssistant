S. B. Narasimha Prakash v State of Karnataka and Another
Supreme Court of India

9 November 1995
W.P. (C) No. 516 of 1989
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This writ petition is filed against the refusal of permission to publish a book titled Commentary on Karnataka Rent Control Act. When the petitioner filed CWP No. 59 of 1988 in this Court, this Court upheld the vires of Rule 9 to Karnataka Civil Services (Conduct) Rules. Since the petitioner being a judicial officer intends to publish the commentary on the above law, this Court opined that the High Court may reconsider for giving permission. Pursuant thereto, the petitioner submitted his representation on 8-3-1988. The High Court had considered and opined that grant of such permission was not conducive.
Therefore, it declined to grant permission. It being discretionary and the petitioner being in judicial service, we do not find any illegality in declining to grant permission. The writ petition is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Petition dismissed.
