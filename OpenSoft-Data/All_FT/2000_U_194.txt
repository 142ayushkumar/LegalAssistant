Union of India v Gurcharan Singh
Supreme Court of India

8  May  2000
Cr.A. No. ... of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The Union of India assails the order of the learned Single Judge of the Rajasthan High Court granting bail to the accused-respondent who has been found to be involved in commission of offence under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short "the Act").
2.  It is contended by the learned Additional Solicitor General that while considering the question of grant of bail, the High Court did not bear in mind the provisions of Section 37 of the Act which are mandatory and, therefore, the impugned order must be held to be unsustainable in law.
3.  When notice was issued from this Court, the accused-respondent did not appear notwithstanding due service of notice, and therefore, the Court had to take recourse to issuance of non-bailable warrants of arrest pursuant to which he has been arrested and is now in custody.
4.  On a bare perusal of the impugned order of the High Court, we are satisfied that the High Court has not borne in mind the provisions of Section 37 of the Act before releasing the accused-respondent on bail.
5. We, therefore, set aside the said order and allow this appeal. We direct that the trial be concluded expeditiously.
Appeal allowed.
