Supreme Court of India

8 August 2001
Review Petition(Cr.) No. 800/2001 in S.L.P.(Cr.)No. 3670/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is an inordinate delay of 238 days in filing this review petition. The explanation offered for condonation of delay is neither satisfactory nor reasonable.
The application seeking condonation of delay is therefore rejected.
2.  Even otherwise, we have carefully gone through the review petition and the connected papers. We find no merit in the same.
3.  The review petition is accordingly dismissed both on the ground of delay and merits.
Review dismissed.
