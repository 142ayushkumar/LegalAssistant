Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...CC 950/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  We are of the view that there is a substantial compliance of service of notice. Therefore, we are not inclined to interfere with the matter. The Special Leave Petition is dismissed. After we dismissed the matter, learned counsel for the petitioner stated that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises immediately, it shall create great hardship to him.
2. Therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is justified. We, therefore, grant time till 31.8.2001 to the petitioner to vacate the premises on his filing usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from today.
3.  The petitioner shall hand over vacant possession of the premises on or before the expiry of the said period. In case the landlord has any objection to this part of the order, it shall be open to him to apply for vacation of this part of the order.
Order accordingly.
