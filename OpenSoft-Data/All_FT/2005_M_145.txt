Mahmud Mian (Dead) Through Lrs. and another v Shamsuddin Mian (Dead) Through Lrs. and others
Supreme Court of India

4 March 2005
C.A. No. 1550 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 18190 of 2000)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
IAs Nos. 1 and 2
1.  Delay condoned. Prayer for substitution allowed. Legal representatives of deceased Respondents 2, 5 and 22 are permitted to be brought on record. The respondents' plea that the appeal had abated in the High Court itself is kept open. The names of Respondents 20 and 21 are deleted from the array of parties, at the risk of the petitioners.
IA No. 3
2.  Prayer seeking deletion of the name of Petitioner 2 is allowed as her LRs are already on record.
Leave granted.
3.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are satisfied that the impugned judgment of the Division Bench does not satisfactorily dispose of the appeal. It was a partition suit. On account of the death of one of the parties, the appeal could not have abated in its entirety.
4. This appeal is, therefore, allowed. The impugned judgment dated 3-3-2000 is set aside and the letters patent appeal is remanded to the High Court for hearing and decision afresh on merits.
5.  The learned counsel for the respondents submits that the letters patent appeal before the High Court was not maintainable. That plea does not appear to have been raised before the High Court. While hearing the appeal on merits, the Division Bench of the High Court shall also examine the question of maintainability of letters patent appeal.
6.  Both the learned counsel for the parties pray that the litigation being about 35 years old, the appeal may be heard expeditiously. We allow the parties liberty of making that prayer before the High Court. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
