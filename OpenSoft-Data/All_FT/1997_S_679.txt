Angoori Devi v State of U. P.
Supreme Court of India

19 March 1997
C.As. No. 368 of 1985 with Nos. 2493, 1294-95 of 1985 and 15695 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Having read the decisions reported in State of U.P. v. L.J. Johnson 1983 Indlaw SC 121 (two-Judge Bench) and the decision reported in Meera Gupta v. State of W.B. 1991 Indlaw SC 319 and the referring order in Angoori Devi v. State of U.P. 1997 Indlaw SC 783, we think that there are certain areas in these judgments which would require consideration and it would, therefore, be proper if the matters are placed before a larger Bench of 5 Hon'ble Judges so that it is resolved once for all.
Order accordingly.
