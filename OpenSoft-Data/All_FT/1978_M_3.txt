1.  Having heard counsel for the parties and given our thoughtful consideration to submissions made by them, we do not think that any interference with the judgment and order of the High Court is called on for insofar as the conviction of the appellant for the offence u/s. 16(1)(a) read with Ss. 7 and 2(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act read with Rule 46 of the rules made under the said Act, in respect of the sale of 450 grams of ghee to the Food Inspector, is concerned.
2. However, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, we think that the period of imprisonment already undergone by the appellant and fine of Rs. 500 will meet the ends of justice. In default of the payment of fine, the appellant shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months as ordered by the High Court. With this modification in sentence, the appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
