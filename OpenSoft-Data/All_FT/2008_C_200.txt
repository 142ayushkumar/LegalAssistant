Commissioner of Central Excise v Tata Technology Limited
Supreme Court of India

15 July 2008
C.A. No. 657 of 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The short question which has not been considered by the authorities below and which is not the basis of the show cause notice issued by the Assistant Commissioner under Service Tax is whether the Assistant Commissioner (Adjudicating Authority) had the power to go beyond the Registration Certificate issued by the Competent Authority treating the respondent-assessee as the consulting engineer prior to 10th September, 2004.
2. Since the very foundation is missing, we are not inclined to interfere in this Civil Appeal.
3.  Accordingly, the Civil Appeal stands dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
