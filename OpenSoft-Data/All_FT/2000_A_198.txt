Ashok Umraomal Sancheti v Rispalchand
Supreme Court of India

3 January 2000
C.As. No. 7 of 2000 .
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The dispute arises out of suits which had been filed by the appellants under Order 37 CPC. On applications for leave to defend being filed, the High Court granted unconditional leave.
2.  It would have been of assistance if the High Court had given reasons as to why unconditional leave was being granted. From the impugned orders, we are unable to fathom the reason for granting unconditional leave to defend.
3.  We, accordingly, allow these appeals, set aside the impugned orders of the High Court and remit the cases to the High Court for deciding afresh the applications of the respondent herein for leave to defend.
4. In the meantime, pending such decision, there will be an attachment of the entire property of the respondent herein.
Appeals allowed.
