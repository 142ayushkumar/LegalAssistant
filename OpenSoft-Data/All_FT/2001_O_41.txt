Orissa State Housing Board v Sankarsan Acharya
Supreme Court of India

28 February 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4675/1995
The Order of the court was as follows:
1. The dispute in this case is only in relation to award of interest 8% per annum for the amount deposited from the date of the last instalment till 1.3.1988 when the revised allotment order was issued superseding the first allotment order and for interest from 1.3.1988 to 28.2.1989 when the order of delivery of possession was issued.
2.  The Commission was of the view that an inference has to be drawn that it is on account of negligence of the officers of the appellant there was delay in construction of the house, as a result the price stood escalated.

It is in this special circumstance, the State Commission having awarded interest to the respondent and the National Commission not having interfered with the order made by the State Commission, we do not think it is a fit case for our interference. The appeal, therefore, stands dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
