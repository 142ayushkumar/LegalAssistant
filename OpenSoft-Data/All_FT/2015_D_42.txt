Delhi Transport Corporation v Ramesh Chand
Supreme Court of India

27 November 2015
Civil Appeal Nos. 13787 of 2015 (@ S. L. P. (C) No. 34842/2012)
(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Anil R. Dave, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that the respondent should not have been granted backwages.
3. It is also pertinent to note that the respondent did not lead any evidence to show that he did not work when he was not in service of the appellant during the pendency of the matter. Therefore, in our opinion, it would be just and appropriate not to award any backwages to the respondent.
4. For the aforesaid reason, the impugned judgment and order is modified to the effect that no backwages shall be awarded to the respondent.
5. Appeal stands disposed of as allowed.
Appeal disposed of
