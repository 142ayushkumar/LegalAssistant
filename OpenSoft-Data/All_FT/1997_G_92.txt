Gurdip Singh v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 March 1997
C.A. No. 2023 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 4666 of 1996)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1. This case unfolds a very sad affair in a school where the selection of Respondent 3 as Headmistress of the school was made in flagrant violation of the principles of natural justice. It has been established beyond doubt that the father of Respondent 3 being the Secretary of the Managing Committee of the school participated in the selection of his daughter, Respondent 3 and later on confirmation was given about such selection in favour of Respondent 3 where Respondent 3 by virtue of improper selection also constituted as one of the members of the Managing Committee giving confirmation.
2. In the aforesaid circumstances, we set aside the selection of Respondent 3 as the Headmistress of the said school. Respondent 3 will cease to function as Headmistress of the said school with immediate effect.
3. The Managing Committee of the school will take immediate steps to select the Headmaster or Headmistress of the school in accordance with law. The appeal is disposed of accordingly without any order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
