Neeraj Pathak v State of Uttar Pradesh and another
Supreme Court of India

8 April 2005
Transfer Petition (Cr.) No. 132 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner is the complainant in Neeraj Pathok v. Tej Pal Singh pending in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Ist, Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh. The said case is sought to be transferred to an appropriate court at Delhi.
2.  Respondent 2, accused in the aforesaid case, is a police officer who, at the relevant time, was posted at Bulandshahar. It does appear that although order for summoning the accused was passed by the Magistrate concerned on 16-9-2002, but for years, the accused has not appeared in court and that is despite repeated orders passed by the court and the petitioner also having approached the higher authorities.
3. According to the petitioner, the accused is in connivance with the local police and has utmost influence thereupon. Without, however, going into the veracity of this assertion, but, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the aforesaid case deserves to be transferred in terms of prayer (a) of the petition.
4.  The transfer petition is, accordingly, allowed and Neeraj Pathak v. Tej Pal Singh is transferred from the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Ist, Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh, to the District and Sessions Judge, Delhi, who shall assign the case to an appropriate court.
5.  The petitioner and Respondent 2 shall appear before the District and Sessions Judge, Delhi on 2-5-2005. All papers shall be sent to the learned Judge before the said date.
Petition allowed.
