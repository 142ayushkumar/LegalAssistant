State Through C. B. I., New Delhi v K. K. Jajodia and Another
Supreme Court of India

4 April 1988
S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 147 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Special leave petition has been filed against an order passed by the High Court of Delhi granting anticipatory bail. Having heard learned Attorney General for the petitioner and Mr. Nariman for the respondents, it is apparent that the conclusions that have been reached by the learned Judge of the High Court on the facts which are yet to be examined at the trial is absolutely uncalled for and the observations made and the conclusions reached shall not in any manner be considered by the court while trying the case. It is further directed that as the respondents have already been released on bail, they shall remain on bail, but shall cooperate with the petitioner for the purposes of investigation.
2.  The learned counsel for the respondents states that Shri. K. K. Jajodia is in London, but he states that he will be back in India by the end of April. He also states that since he is coming back to India, he and the other respondent is in India, he and other respondent will cooperate with the petitioner for the purposes of the investigation.
3.   We, therefore, direct that by the end of April 1988, when the respondent is in India, the petitioner shall be informed immediately and the bail to the respondents will be subject to the condition that they shall cooperate for the purposes of investigation as and when it is necessary for the officer of the CBI. With this direction, the special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
