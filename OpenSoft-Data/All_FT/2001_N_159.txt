Nilesh Hemani v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

16 April 2001
C.A. No. 3792 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave is granted.
Heard learned counsels for the parties.
1.  In our view, this appeal may be disposed of in terms of our order dated 16-10-2000 and we, accordingly, pass the following order in appeal.
2.  We are not inclined to stay the impugned notice under section 158BC of the Income-tax Act, 1961 issued by the Dy. Commissioner, Central Circle 39, Mumbai, on 28-1-1998.
It will be open to the petitioner to take such pleas along with the return as are open to him in law. The assessing authority shall consider the contentions raised by the petitioner in accordance with law uninfluenced by anything stated by the learned Single Judge in his order dated 28-11-1998 in MP. No. 878/99 and the Division Bench in the order under challenge dated 18-12-1999 .
3.  Mr. Verma, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, however, contends that a petition has been filed by appellant before the Settlement Commission and it may also be clarified that the observations made by the High Court will not bind the Settlement Commission.
It is needless to mention that the subject-matter of the writ petition was the notice issued under section 158BC and not the proceedings before the Settlement Commission and the Settlement-Commission was not a party to the writ petition, therefore, the question of Settlement Commission being bound by the observations of the High Court does not arise.
4.  The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
