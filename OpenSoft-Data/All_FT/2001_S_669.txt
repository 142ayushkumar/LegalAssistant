Messrs M.K.Construction, Gujarat v State of Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

20 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14782/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. Delay condoned.
3. Leave granted.
4 .The short question that arises for our consideration is whether the Gujarat Public Works Contracts Disputes Arbitration Tribunal, Ahmedabad was justified in refusing to entertain the disputes raised by the appellant for adjudication on the ground of delay which order was confirmed by the High Court. On perusal of the relevant documents on record and on consideration of the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and taking note of the situation that the set of claims made by the State Government has been referred to the Tribunal in which also there was delay. We are inclined to take the view that the delay on the part of the appellant to raise the disputes before the Arbitration Trinunal should be condoned subject to payment of a consolidated sum of Rs.2,500/- as costs within a period of four weeks from today.
"On fulfilment of the condition, the Tribunal shall entertain the disputes raised by the appellant and dispose of the matter on merits expeditiously, if possible within a period of four months from the date of the receipt of the copy of this order."
5. In appeal arising out of SLP(C)No.8416/2000, the payment of Rs.2,500/- will be made within a period of four weeks from today.
6. We make it clear that this order is passed without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties on merits. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
