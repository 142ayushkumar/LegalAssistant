District Magistrate and Another v Kulbir Chand
Supreme Court of India

28 August 1987
Cr.A. No. 411 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Special leave granted. Arguments heard.
2.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are distressed to find that there was complete non-application of mind on the part of the learned Judges. While it is true that they were entitled to come to a particular conclusion upon the facts of a given case, they could not possible have quashed the impugned order of detention merely on the ground that detention orders in similar cases had earlier been revoked. Each case has no be decided on its own facts.
3.  Accordingly, the appeal succeeds and is allowed. The judgment and order of the High Court are set aside and it is directed to dispose of the writ petition as expeditiously as possible; and in any event, not later than four weeks from today.
Appeal allowed.
