Ajit Singh & Ors. v State Of Haryana & Ors
Supreme Court of India

17 October 1984
Writ Petition (civil)  9345-9498 of 1983, Writ Petitions Nos. 11347-11374 of 1984 and 13518-13628 of 1983
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Having considered the rival contentions of the parties in these writ petitions, we are of the opinion that the orders whereby the petitioners were dismissed from service are unsupportable.
Accordingly, we wet aside those orders and direct that the petitioners shall be reinstated in service on or before November 1, 1984, without a beak in their service. They will be entitled to 50 per cent. of back wages only, from the date of their dismissal until reinstatement, that is, until November 1, 1984. They will be entitled to full pay and admissible allowances with effect from November 1, 1984.
2. Having regard to the nature of the allegations against the petitioners, no further enquiry shall be held nor any disciplinary action taken against them or any one or more of them, in regard to the incidents which resulted in their dismissal from service and which form the subject matter of these writ petitions.
3. The petitioners will report for duty punctually on November 1, 1984 at the respective places where they were working at the time of their dismissal.
4. The writ petitions are allowed to the extent indicated above. There will be no order as to costs.
