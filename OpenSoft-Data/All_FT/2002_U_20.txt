Union Of India & Anr v H.M. Dayal
Supreme Court of India

7 October 2002
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Civil) No.7609/2002
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  This matter arises out of a clarification petition filed by the petitioner in regard to the claim of the respondent for payment of salary, pursuant to an order made by the Central Administrative Tribunal. Said clarification petition was rejected by the High Court on the ground that this clarification can be obtained only in the pending contempt proceedings before the Tribunal.
2.  With a view to put an end to the dispute including the contempt proceedings, we have directed the petitioner to compute and pay disputed salary without compromising its stand in law. Pursuant to the said direction, the petitioner has today tendered a cheque for a sum of Rs. 1006/- a sum equivalent to 10 days' salary which, according to the respondent, is due to him and the same has been accepted by the learned counsel for the respondent as full and final settlement of this claim, which has given rise to the contempt petition.
3.  In view of the above development, we permit the parties to bring this to the notice of the Tribunal so thatthe contempt petition could also be closed.
With the above observations the SLP is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
