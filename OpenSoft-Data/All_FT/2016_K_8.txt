1. Having extensively heard the learned counsel appearing for both sides and on going through the records we find that the High Court as per the impugned order has passed a fair, just, proper, reasonable and equitable order with regard to the partition of the family property by giving equal share to all the children. Thus we do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court. The civil appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed
