Controller of Estate Duty, Madras v Mokammal Smt
Supreme Court of India

24 July 1991
C.A. No. 502 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal was listed along with Civil Appeal No. 1204 of 1979 and Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 335 of 1979 as these were all considered to raise similar issues.
2.  We have heard all the three appeals together. But so far as this appeal is concerned, Sri Manchanda, appearing on behalf of Controller of Estate Duty, fairly draws our attention to the fact that the High Court has disposed of the matter before it on two grounds. It has primarily accepted the Tribunal's finding that Kalyana Sundram Pillai had taken the property right from the beginning as joint family property in his hand. In view of this finding of fact which has remained unchallenged, the further question as to whether there is any disposition when an individual throws his individual property into the hotchpotch of the family which will attract the provisions of the Estate Duty Act becomes academic.
3.   We, therefore, hold that, in view of the above finding of fact of the Tribunal accepted by the High Court, the High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the value of the entire property in question could not be included in the free estate of the deceased. In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
