D. Mallaiah v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

11  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19386/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
This Court on 10th January 2000 passed the following Order :
"Notice may be issued for final disposal.The notice will require the respondents to state why the decree of the Reference Court should not be sustained by relying upon Order 41 Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure."
1.  After notice, we heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the appellant relies on the case of Ravinder Kumar Sharma Vs. State of Assam & Ors. This case squarely covers the point raised on behalf of the appellants.
2.  In view of this, the High Court was not right in not permitting the appellant to raise the point, in view of Order 41 Rule 22. The only point remains in respect of rate of quantum fixed. The High Court reduced the amount to Rs.80/- per sq.yd. from Rs.86/- per sq.yd. with deduction of 40% towards developmental charges.
3. There was no material for the High Court to reduce this. The High Court itself records that in cases of doubling the railway line, this Court consistently gave a deduction between 10% and 15%.
4.  We feel, on the facts of the present case and the findings recorded by the High Court, it is appropriate that the quantum as fixed by the Referring Court, i.e., at the rate of Rs.86/- per sq.yd. is confirmed subject to the deduction of only 15% towards development charges. With the aforesaid declaration the present appeals are allowed. Costs on the parties.
Appeals allowed.
