Prakash Wati Smt. and Others v R. L. Kapur
Supreme Court of India

16 September 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These tenants' petitions are directed against the judgment and order of the Delhi High Court. One of the ground on which the order of eviction was passed by the rent control authorities and upheld by the High Court was that the petitioners had sublet the premises. When these petitions were heard on occasion earlier and the finding recorded by the High Court on sub-tenancy was assailed both on law and facts one of the objections raised on behalf of the respondent was that the petitions were liable to be dismissed as the High Court and the rent control authorities have found it as a fact that the petitioners were guilty of committing forgery and fabricating documents. Since the objection appeared to be vital, the records from the Rent Control Officer were summoned by an order dated 5-8-1994.
2.  We have perused the record and heard Shri. P. N. Lekhi and Shri. R. P. Bansal, the learned counsel for the petitioners at length. From the perusal of the partnership deed, the employees' register of the hotel etc. it appears that the finding recorded by the High Court and the rent control authorities that the petitioners were guilty of forgery and fabrication is well founded.
3.   The jurisdiction exercised by this Court is extraordinary to promote and advance justice. A party who is guilty of forgery and fabrication has an unclean hand. The equity courts refrain from exercising discretion in favour of such a person. Therefore, even if there is some merit in the legal proposition advanced on behalf of the petitioners, we are not inclined to examine it.
These special leave petitions are accordingly dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
