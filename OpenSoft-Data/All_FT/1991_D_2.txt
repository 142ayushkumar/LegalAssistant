State of Orissa v D. Pattanayak and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 September 1991
S.L.P. (Civil) Nos. 13498-99 of 1991 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 16 April 1991 of the High Court of Orissa at Cuttack in OJC Nos. 1971 & 2001 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned Attorney General in support of the petition. We have not considered it appropriate to issue notice to the respondents as we are not substantially interfering with the impugned order of the High Court.
2.  The State Tribunal for quite some time had only three members including the Chairman. There is already a proposal initiated by the Government to make it a four-member Tribunal with the new Chairman appointed a month back.
In that view of the matter, the order of the High Court can be easily complied with by allowing one bench to operate at Bhubaneswar and other bench at Cuttack and leaving it open to the Chairman to require the members of the Cuttack Bench to go back to Bhubaneswar as and when there is no pending work to be handled by the Cuttack Bench.
3.  In view of what we have said the direction given by the High Court to the Chairman of the State Tribunal is deleted.
4.  This arrangement should be worked out with effect from October 1, 1991. With these observations the special leave petitions are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
