Dhalla Ram v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

24 February 1997
S.L.P. (C) No. 3363 of 1997
The Order of the Court is as follows
1. This special leave petition arises from the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, made on 12-7-1993 dismissing the petitioner's application for appointment on compassionate grounds. The father of the petitioner died on 13-12-1965 on which date the petitioner was below 6 years. He attained majority, on his own statement, on 12-7- 1977, when he a completed 18 years of age. He made an application on 15-7-1987 for his employment on compassionate grounds. The very object of making appointment on compassionate grounds is to rehabilitate the family in distress of the deceased employee who dies in harness.
There should be no difficulty in considering an eligible candidate for providing immediate sustenance to the members of the deceased employee. He had applied on15-7-1987 and the application was rejected on 14-7-1988. He filed the OA on 12-7-1993.
2. In view of the long delay, after the refusal by the Government, in filing the application, the same cannot be entertained. The appointment on compassionate grounds is not a method of recruitment but is a facility to provide for immediate rehabilitation of the family in distress for relieving the dependent family members of the deceased employee from destitution.
3. Under these circumstances, we do not find any ground warranting interference with the order passed by the Tribunal dismissing the application on 12-7-1993.
The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
