Calcutta Footwear Co. P. Ltd. v Oriental Insurance Company Limited and Anr
Supreme Court of India

20 November 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned Single Judge has gave a finding that there was a dispute which could have been referred to arbitration. When an appeal was preferred before the Division Bench, while granting stay, it said that, prima facie, there appeared to be no dispute which could be referred to arbitration.
2. While arriving at this prima facie conclusion, the Division Bench did not give any details as to why it felt that there was a prima facie case and to why it was differing from the view of the learned Single Judge.
3.  The petitioner has moved this Court for setting aside the order of the Division Bench. The petitioner may move an application before the Division Bench of the High Court for a review of the order passed by it on 3.7.2000, so that the High Court can deal with the the question of prima facie case on merits.
With the above observation, the SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
