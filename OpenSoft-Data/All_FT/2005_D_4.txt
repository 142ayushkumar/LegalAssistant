D. Prabhakaran v Inspector of Police, Tamil Nadu
Supreme Court of India

5 January 2005
Cr.A. No. 14 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 2094 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court, while dismissing the application filed by the appellant for grant of anticipatory bail, directed the investigating officer to arrest the appellant. Insofar as dismissal of prayer for grant of anticipatory bail is concerned, we find no infirmity in the impugned order of the High Court.
2. In fact, that aspect is not even under challenge. The limited challenge is to the direction to the investigating officer to arrest the appellant within twenty four hours. That is under the province of the investigating officer under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
3.  This aspect stands concluded by a decision of this Court in M.C. Abraham v. State of Maharashtra 2002 Indlaw SC 1560 holding that a person whose petition for grant of anticipatory bail has been rejected may or may not be arrested by the investigating officer depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of the offence, the background of the accused, the facts disclosed in the course of investigation and other relevant considerations.
4.  In this view, while issuing notice, this Court had directed, "stay of the impugned order will not mean that the investigating agency cannot arrest the petitioner, if it is so required". The impugned order is modified in the said terms and the appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
