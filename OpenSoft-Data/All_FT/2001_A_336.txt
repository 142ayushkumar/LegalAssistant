M.A. Gafoor v Azizunnissa Begum and Others
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13966/2001
The Ordeder of the Court was as follows:
1.  The principal grievance projected by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that so far as the arrears are concerned, the petitioner is being asked to make double payment, i.e., to pay to the respondents Nos.1 to 3 while he has already made payment to respondent No.4 and this fact, though stated in the counter affidavit filed before the High Court, appears to have been overlooked in the impugned order.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the petitioner would be advised to bring this material fact specifically to the notice of the High Court and persuade the High Court to suitably modify the interim order. The special leave petition is dismissed as withdrawn with liberty aforesaid.
Petition dismissed.
