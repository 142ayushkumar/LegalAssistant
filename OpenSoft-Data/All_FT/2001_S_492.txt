ITC Bhadrachalam Paper Boards Limited v State of Andhra Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 August 2001
C.A. No. 1247 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  By an order dated 21st March, 2001, a three Judge Bench of this Court has referred the matter to a larger Bench for re- consideration of the majority view in the judgment of the nine Judge Bench in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. and Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors. 1996 Indlaw SC 1515.
2.  Appearing on behalf of the appellant, Mr. F.S. Nariman, learned Senior counsel submits that he does not question the correctness of the majority view in Mafatlal's case.
3. Learned Solicitor General, appearing for the State, also submits that the State does not question the correctness of the majority view in Mafatlal's case (supra). We also do not doubt its correctness.
4.  That being the position, it appears that reference to a larger Bench for a fresh look of the judgment in Mafatlal's case is not called for.
5.  Under the circumstances, we direct that the Civil Appeal be listed, for its disposal in accordance with law, before a three-Judge Bench.
Order accordingly.
