Delhi High Court through Registrar v Mahinder Pal and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11732/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have examined the record carefully and have heard elaborate arguments from learned counsel for the parties.
2.  In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order. The special leave petition is, therefore, dismissed.
3.  We, however, clarify that the order of dismissal of special leave petition shall not be construed as our having expressed any opinion on the question of law involved, which we leave open.
4.  Further we wish to observe that this case has been decided on its own peculiar facts and shall not be treated as a precedent.
Petition dismissed.
