Ghanshyam Das Mundhra v Sajjan Sharma and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14428/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This Special Leave Petition is against an interim order of the High Court. According to Mr. Jain, such interim order by the High Court, while the Writ Petition under Article 226 is pending, is against the scheme of the Co-operative Societies Act. Having examined the relevant provisions of the Co-operative Societies Act, we are of the opinion that the contention is wholly mis-conceived, and there is no fetter on the power of the Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 to put the Assistant Registrar In-charge of the Society, and prevent either an elected committee or the pre-existing committee to function the management of the Society.
2. In our view, this is the only course available for the Court where either an election process is assailed or an election to a committee of management is assailed. We therefore dismiss the Special Leave Petition.
Petition dismissed.
