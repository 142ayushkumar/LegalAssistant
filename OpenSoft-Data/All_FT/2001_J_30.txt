Jagdish Anand v Pawan Khera
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  This is a petition for transferring a criminal case from the Court of Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate S No.2 situated at Udaipur (Rajasthan)to a Court at Delhi. Respondent filed a complaint against the petitioner for the offence under Section 500 of the IPC alleging that petitioner had published a defamatory imputation against the respondent. It is admitted that petitioner is an MLA of Delhi State.
2.  On a reading of the allegations we are of the view that if the petitioner admits having made the publication the burden will shift on to him to prove one of the exceptions contained in Section 499 of the IPC, as the imputation are per se defamatory. In order to enable the petitioner to discharge the burden effectively he requests that the case may be transferred from Udaipur to Delhi as all the witnesses whom he has to examine are all available in Delhi itself. We are now told that respondent-complainant is the Officer on Special Duty attached to the office of the Chief Minister of Delhi. This means that the transfer would be to his advantage also.
3. However learned counsel for the respondent submitted that it would be greately difficult to appear in the court on the days when the case is posted for trial. It is upto him to move application for exemption from appearance on such of those days when it is difficult for him to appear. The court concerned shall dispose of such application on its own merits.
4.  For the aforesaid reasons we order transfer of case No. 145/2000 titled Pawan Khera vs. Jagdish Anand to the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi. The said Metropolitan Magistrate may try the case himself or he can assign it to any other Magistrate within his domain who is competent to try the same.
With these observations the transfer petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
