Arm Limited v Commissioner of Customs, Madras
Supreme Court of India

10 February 2004
C.A. No. 1080 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The grievance made by the appellant in this appeal is that when the matter was posted for hearing on 8-9-1997, the name of the Advocate on record was not shown in the cause list and, therefore, due arrangement could not be made for appearance and in such circumstances the appeal came to be disposed of by the Tribunal. The respondent is not in a position to controvert this position.
2. In the circumstances, we set aside the order made by the Tribunal and remit the matter to the Tribunal for fresh disposal in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
