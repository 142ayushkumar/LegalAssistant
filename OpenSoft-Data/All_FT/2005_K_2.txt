In Re : Kidnapping of Mahendra Prasad Gupta
Supreme Court of India

5 September 2005
W.P. (Cri.) No. 274 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  A letter has been sent by Mr Girish Kumar Sanghi, Member of Parliament and also said to be Acting Chairman, Rashtriya Vaishya Mahasammelan and Chairman of the Negotiation Group to Hon'ble the Chief Justice complaining that Gajendra Singh, Sub-Inspector, has joined hands with the accused persons in Sasaram Town Police Case No. 298 of 2003 in relation to the kidnapping of Mahendra Prasad Gupta, younger brother of one Dr. Moti Chand. The said Dr. Moti Chand seems to have written a letter dated 9-7-2005 to the aforesaid Member of Parliament.
2. It appears from the letter of Mr Girish Kumar Sanghi that the investigation is pending in the State of Bihar. Copy of the letter dated 9-7-2005 was also addressed to the Chief Secretary, Bihar, Secretary of Home, Bihar and the Director General of Police, Bihar.
3.  We are of the view that the proper course to follow, on the facts and circumstances of the case in hand, is to approach the High Court in case there is any grievance about either the slow progress of the investigation or collusion of the investigating officer with the persons who are accused in the said police case. Except the letter of Mr Sanghi and a copy of the letter dated 9-7-2005, we have no material, not even a copy of the FIR.
4. In this view, we decline to entertain this letter as a writ petition.
5.  A copy of this order shall he sent to Mr Girish Kumar Sanghi.
Order accordingly.
