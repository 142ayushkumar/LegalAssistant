State of Madhya Pradesh v Gopal Dubey
Supreme Court of India

15 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 724/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We had issued notice in this case as the High Court of Madhya Pradesh had invoked the proviso to section 376 while reducing the sentence 5 years without giving any reason. It appears that the accused has already served the sentence for 5 years.
2. In this view of the matter, we are not inclined to further go into the matter though the contention of the learned counsel for the State that the High Court must give reasons while exercising power under proviso to section 376 is wholly correct.
The Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
