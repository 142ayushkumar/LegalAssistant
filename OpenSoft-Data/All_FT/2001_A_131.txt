All India Motor Transport Congress v State of Karnataka and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) Nos.15290-15291/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petitions stated that the matter might be disposed of at this stage by an order setting aside the orders under challenge and restoring the writ appeals to the file of the High Court for being heard and disposed of on merits.
2.  The High Court summarily dismissed the writ appeals against the orders of the learned Single Judge dismissing the appellants' writ petitions. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petitions relying upon the judgment and order of a learned Single Judge in Writ Petition Nos.14159-160 of 1999 between Indira Travels and the State of Karnataka. The High Court dismissed the writ appeals relying on the same judgment of the learned Single Judge.
3. We do not think that that is an appropriate course to follow. We think that the correctness of the judgment in the case of Indira Travels should have received consideration at the hands of the Division Bench. Accordingly, without saying any more, we propose to restore the writ appeals to the file of the High Court.
4.  The civil appeals are allowed. The orders under challenge are set aside.
5.  The writ appeals (Nos.6247 and 6246 of 1999) are restored to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits. No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
