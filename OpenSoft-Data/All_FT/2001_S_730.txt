State of Haryana v Chitwant Kaur (D) By Lrs
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.22367/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appliction is directed against an order of eviction, which order stood affirmed by dismissal of the State's appeal before the appellate court being barred by time, and against the said order a revision was filed, that also was dismissed by the High Court. We see hardly any justification for interference by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.
The SLP is accordingly dismissed.
2.  The counsel appearing for the State prayed that some time be given to deliver vacant possession of the premises. Having considered his submissions, and the fact that the Office of the State Government is there in the premises in question, we direct that the State shall deliver vacant possession of the premises on or before 31st March, 2002 and would pay the necessary monthly rent/damages during that period, and subject to further undertaking being given within four weeks from today.
Petition dismissed.
