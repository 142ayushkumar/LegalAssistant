Anand Kumar Makkar v Indian Institute of Technology and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20134-20135/2000
The order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  In view of the categorical statement made in the affidavit of Prof. B.C. Nakra dated 31st October, 1994 filed in the High Court in the contempt petition that no substantive post of Senior Scientist Officer, Grade II has arisen or permanent appointment made after the judgment of the High Court dated 14.1.1992, we are not satisfied that this was a fit case for filing a contempt petition by the petitioner.
2. If he is aggrieved by any action or inaction of the respondents, it is open to him to take recourse to such proceedings as are available in accordance with law.
The special leave petitions are dismissed in the aforesaid terms.
Petitions dismissed.
