Supreme Court of India

30 January 2008
W.P. (Civil) No(s). 725 of 1994 with I.A.No. 32 in W.P.(C) No. 725/1994, I.A. Nos. 20 & 21 in W.P.(C) No. 4677/1985
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. On 30th November, 2007, this Court has directed that the Delhi Board shall secure and file the report regarding the feasibility and implementation of Board the construction of interceptor sewer project. We are informed that the Jal has appointed M/s.Engineers India Ltd. as Consultant with overall responsibility of the concept to commissioning of the entire interceptor sewerage system project. In action plan, the consultant has stated that data analysis will be done for correct the assessment of flow after rehabilitation of trunk/peripheral sewers. But from affidavit dated 29.1.2008 of the Jal Board it is seen that the rehabilitation of the trunk sewer is likely to be completed only by the end of 2009. Therefore, if the analysis cannot be done before the end of 2009, planning of project and commencement of execution is not possible before the later part of 2010. But the Jal Board has also given a schedule of the activities for the interceptor project in the affidavit which shows that collection of data by the consultant would be completed by 30th May, 2008 and planning will be completed by November, 2008 and the work could be commenced in February, 2009 and would be completed by 2012. There is thus considerable inconsistency. It is not explained as to how this work could be commenced before the completion of rehabilitation of the trunk sewer project. The learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Jal Board submitted that the Jal Board, in consultation with M/s.Engineers India Ltd., will file a revised affidavit.
He also submitted that the Delhi Jal Board will file its further response to this Court by 15th June, 2008, after receiving the report from the consultant.
2. Let the matter be posted on 8th July, 2008. I.A.No.32/2006 The Delhi Government has filed this I.A. seeking approval for the regularisation of 1432 unauthorised colonies in Delhi. Learned Amicus Curiae and the D.D.A. shall file its reply within eight weeks.
Order accordingly
