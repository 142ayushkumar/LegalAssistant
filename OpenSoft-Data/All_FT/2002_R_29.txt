Lucknow Municipal Corporation & Anr v Raj Kumar & Anr
Supreme Court of India

28 October 2002
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Civil) No.5224/2002
The Order of court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  The impugned order of the High Court directing reinstatement and refusing to pay any back wages with the further observation that the case of the respondent for regularisation be duly considered does not require to be interfered with by this Court since the respondent got involved in a criminal case, and after being acquitted of the criminal charges, he was not permitted to do the job on even daily wage basis.
2. Needless to mention that the observation for regularisation must be in accordance with relevant scheme or rules, and if under the rules in force the respondent does not satisfy the criteria for regularisation, question of regularisation would not arise.
The SLP stands disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
