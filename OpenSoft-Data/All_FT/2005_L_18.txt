Phool Chandra Singh v Laxmi Prasad and another
Supreme Court of India

4 February 2005
C.A. No. ... of 2005 (D. No. 19936 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the State Bar Council had lost jurisdiction to decide the case on expiry of the period of one year under Section 36-B(1) of the Advocates Act, 1961.
2. However, the appellate order of the Bar Council of India does not reflect the plea having been taken and pressed for decision before the Bar Council of India. The learned counsel for the appellant states that the appellant would be advised to seek a review of the order of the Bar Council of India on that ground.
3.  We record the statement of the learned counsel for the appellant and dismiss the appeal as withdrawn with liberty to move a review petition before the Bar Council of India.
Appeal dismissed.
