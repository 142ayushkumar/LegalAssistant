Ghaziabad Development Authority v K. K. Sharma
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2009
C.A. No. 6050 of 2002
(Non-Reportable)The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Ghaziabad Development Authority, the appellant herein ('the Authority', for short) floated a housing scheme in Govindpuram named 'Akansha II'. The Authority issued a reservation letter on 26.2.1989 to the respondent. The respondent deposited Rs.21,510/- as registration amount. On 29.12.1993, respondent demanded refund on the ground that the house allotted was not worth living. The Authority refunded the registration amount deposited by the respondent on 20.5.1994 after deducting Rs.5,000/- towards cancellation charges. It did not pay any interest. On a complaint filed by the respondent, the District Forum, by order dated 9.9.1997, directed refund of the deducted amount of Rs.5,000/- and also directed payment of interest on the deposited amount at 18% per annum from the date of deposit till 20.5.1994 alongwith Rs.2,000/- as costs. The appellant filed an appeal before the State Commission in October 1997.
2. However, as there was no stay, in compliance of the District Forum order, the Authority deposited a sum of Rs.5,000/- as also Rs.79,499/- towards interest. Thereafter, the State Commission affirmed the order upholding the interest at 18% per annum. Revision filed by the appellant has been dismissed by a non-speaking order following its earlier decision in Darsh Kumar.
3.  The order of the National Commission in Darsh Kumar has been modified by this Court in HUDA Vs. Darsh Kumar. In several other decisions, this court has reduced the interest payable to 9% to 10% per annum. On the facts and circumstances, we are of the view that award of interest at 18% was not warranted and interest at 10% per annum would be just and reasonable.
4.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal in part and reduce the interest from 18% to 10% per annum. In all other respects, the order of the District Forum is affirmed. Consequently, the Authority shall be entitled to recover back the excess interest paid to the respondent.
Appeal partly allowed.
