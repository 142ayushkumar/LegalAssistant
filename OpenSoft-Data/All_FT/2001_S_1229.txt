Dhara and Others v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil).../2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is no satisfactory explanation for the long delay of 972 days in filing the Special Leave Petition. This was sought by explaining that a restoration application was pending in the High Court as the writ petition was dismissed for default. But we have noticed that even the restoration application was itself filed only after two years of the dismissal order of the writ petition. We have not come across any valid reason for that interregnum of two years.
2.  We are, therefore, not satisfied of any good reason for condoning this long delay. The application for condonation of delay is dismissed. Consequently, Special Leave Petition is also dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
