Union of India and Others v National Federation of Telecom E. and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 September 1998
C.A. Nos. 4619-22/1993 with C.A. Nos. 9704/1995, 4720-4722/1998 and 4719/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Civil Appeals Nos. 4619-22 of 1993
1.  In the impugned order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, which is dated June 11, 1991, the respondents who are employees in the Department of Post and Telecommunications have been given productivity linked bonus on the basis that all those whose emoluments do not exceed Rs. 3, 500 will be entitled to productivity linked bonus. The existing ceiling was of Rs. 2, 500 which was challenged before the Central Administrative Tribunal and was raised to Rs. 3, 500 by the impugned order. Since this judgment has been given effect to, and now from 1996 eligibility ceiling on emoluments has been removed altogether, we do not propose to examine the merits of the Tribunal's judgment.
2. We, however, make it clear that by virtue of the Tribunal's judgment or the ratio therein, the respondents shall not be entitled to claim from 1993 to 1996 a higher ceiling of Rs. 4500 on emoluments for being eligible for the said bonus. The ceiling was raised to Rs. 4500 in 1993 for the railway employees. But this was not done in respect of industrial employees under Section2(13) of the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965.
The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
3. CA. Nos. 4720-22 of 1998 @ SLPs (C) Nos. 5318-20 of 1996, CA No. 4719 of 1998 @ SLP (C) No. 25180 of 1995 and Civil Appeal No. 9704 of 1995.
4.  Leave granted in SLPs (C) Nos. 5318-20 of 1996 and 25180 of 1995.
5.  The respondents in the present appeals are employees of Ordnance Factories under the Ministry of Defence Production. In each of these appeals the Tribunal concerned had followed the judgment in the case of the employees of the Post and Telecommunications Department which is the subject-matter of Appeals Nos. 4619-22 of 1993 decided above. In view of our order therein, these appeals are also disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
