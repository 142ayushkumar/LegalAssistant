Lekha Ramavtar Agarwal v Satyanarayan Mahadeolal Agarwal and Others
Supreme Court of India

8  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 780-781/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner at length. Uma Satyanarayan Agarwal - the respondent No.4 who is present in Court has also made certain submissions.
2.  On perusal of the orders of the trial court as well as of the High Court and on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and the submissions made we are not satisfied that the judgment of the trial court acquitting the accused persons suffers from any serious illegality or perversity in appreciation of the evidence in the case. We are also not satisfied that the High Court committed any serious error in refusing to grant leave to file appeal against the judgment/order of acquittal.
Accordingly these special leave petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
