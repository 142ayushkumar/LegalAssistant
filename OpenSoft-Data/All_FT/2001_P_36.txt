State of Madhya Pradesh and Another v P.K. Shrivastava and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9904/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After we heard learned counsel for the petitioners, we find that despite numerous opportunities given to the petitioners, no counter affidavit to the writ petition was filed by the petitioners before the High Court. Therefore, they are not entitled to dispute the correctness of the facts stated in the writ petition.
2. At this stage, Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents stated that the respondents who were the petitioners before the High Court would be satisfied if revised scale is granted to them w.e.f. 3.5.1989.
3.  We feel that the said statement of learned counsel is fair, looking into the facts and circumstances of this case.
4.  We, therefore, dispose of the petition in terms of the statement made by learned counsel for the respondents, leaving the question of law open to be decided in an appropriate case.
Petition disposed of.
