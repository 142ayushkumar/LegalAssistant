Lakshman Chandra Senapati and Others v Bela Rani Hazra
Supreme Court of India

12 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10082/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court refused to interfere under Section 115 C.P.C. 
 with the order passed by the trial court permitting the respondent to carry out the amendment of the plaint beyond stipulated time. Leave to amend was granted earlier.
2. It is true that the reason given by the High Court that a distinction has to be drawn between an order granting leave to amend the plaint and an order allowing amendment by incorporation, is erroneous.
3.  However, as the trial court rightly granted extension of time for carrying out the amendment, we do not think that this would be a fit case for interference under Article 136 of the Constitution.
4.  Hence, this petition is rejected. Time to file additional written statement is extended upto 30.9.2001.
Petition dismissed.
