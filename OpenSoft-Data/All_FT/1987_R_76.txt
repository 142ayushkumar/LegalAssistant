Ranjodh Singh v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 August 1987
C.A. No. 5889 of 1983
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  About 17 months back the appellant had been given time by the court for compliance which involved deposit of Rs. 270 towards printing charges. That was done when there was a failure for over a year in complying with the Registry's requisition. Counsel for the appellant now says that it is not necessary to prepare the paper book as it is the same as is in the connected matter.
2.   This representation could have certainly been made either in reply to the Registry's notice or to the court when the matter appeared on March 20, 1986. We are of the view that to allow time in a case of this type after two years on default would mean that the control of the proceedings in court would be left in the hands of the litigant. The prayer is dismissed and the appeal shall also stand dismissed for non-compliance of the order.
Appeal allowed.
