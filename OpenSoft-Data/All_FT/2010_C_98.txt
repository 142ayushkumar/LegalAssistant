Commissioner of Central Excise v Indus Coating Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2010
C.A. No. 459 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Heard learned counsel appearing for the appellant.
1.  The respondent has not entered appearance despite service. The appellant has challenged the validity of the impugned judgment and order passed by the Tribunal on 5-7-2005 holding that the classification of plastic laminated aluminium foil should be made under the Heading 7607.60 and not under Heading 39.20 as claimed by the appellant. While rendering the aforesaid decision, the Tribunal relied upon a decision of this Court wherein it was held thus:
"Since the revenue has accepted the judgment of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal in Commissioner of Central Excise, Calcutta v. Indian Foil Ltd. 2000 Indlaw CEGAT 2387 and that the judgment has been followed in the case by Tribunal, the civil appeal is dismissed".
2.  However, subsequent to the rendering of the aforesaid decision by this Court, the same issue came to be considered by this Court in another decision namely Sharp Industries Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai-III 2005 Indlaw SC 583 wherein this court considered the issue and held that the product in question is classifiable under Tariff Heading 39.20 and not under 76.07.
3. While rendering the aforesaid decision, the Division Bench has given detailed reasons as to why the said product should be classified under Tariff Heading 39.20.
Having gone through the said decision, we are of the considered opinion that the issue raised in the present case is covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in Sharp Industries Ltd. 2005 Indlaw SC 583 (supra).
In the light of the aforesaid decision, we hold that the product in question is classifiable under Heading 39.20. The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.
Appeal partly allowed.
