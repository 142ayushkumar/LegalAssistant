Surinder Pal Jain v D.D.A. and Anr
Supreme Court of India

9 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20873/1998
The order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The appellant is accused for murder of his wife and was tried by the Sessions Court. The matter ended in acquittal in his favour. But on appeal the acquittal order was set aside by the High Court and he was convicted. However, in further appeal to this Court, the judgment of the High Court was set aside and the judgment of acquittal passed by the Sessions Court was restored. This happened in 1993. Thereafter the respondent has not considered it fit to initiate any disciplinary proceedings against him. On the other hand, during the pendency of the proceedings the respondents wrote a letter on 6th June, 1987 to the appellant as follows:
"With reference to your representation to the Vice Chairman, DDA dated 24.5.1978, I am directed to state that it has been decided that your request for re-instatement cannot be considered till the appeal is decided."
2. The appellant had filed C.W.P. in 1978 for reinstatement soon after the judgmnent of the Sessions Court. The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition and granted backwages from 1993. The Division Bench on appeal set aside the said judgment. Against the said order, the appellant has preferred this appeal.
3.  In this appeal, after hearing learned senior counsel for the appellant and learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondents, we are of the view that the appellant should get reinstatement into service within two weeks from today but he will not be entitled to any backwages. The previous service of the appellant will not count for any purpose except for the purpose of all retiral benefits.The appeal is allowed to the limited purpose as stated above. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal partly allowed.
