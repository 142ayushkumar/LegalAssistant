Collector of Central Excise and Customs v P. M. P. Components Limited
Supreme Court of India

10 February 2005
C.A. No. 4147 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The issue raised in this appeal is where there are different prices for different dealers of the same class of buyers by way of commercial consideration whether such prices cannot be rejected. The identical issue had already been decided in favour of the assessee by the Tribunal in Gora Mal Hari Ram Ltd. v. CCE  1993 Indlaw CEGAT 506 (CEGAT). Although a submission was raised before the Tribunal which was minded to follow the decision in Gora Mal Hari Ram Ltd 1993 Indlaw CEGAT 506. (supra) that the decision had been challenged before this Court, it appears that this was an incorrect submission.
2. The Department has in fact accepted the decision in Gora Mal Hari Ram Ltd 1993 Indlaw CEGAT 506. (supra) and has not impugned the same. The Tribunal having merely relied upon the decision in Gora Mal Hari Ram Ltd 1993 Indlaw CEGAT 506. (supra) we see no reason to interfere with the decision of the Tribunal.
The appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
