U.P. State Electricity Board v Commissioner Of Central Excise, Allahabad
Supreme Court of India

5 March 2003
C.A. No. 3256 of 2000, Dt. 5 March 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It appears that the Commissioner (Appeals) decided the appealex parte. The appellants preferred an appeal to the Tribunal with a delay of nine months. The Tribunal has by the impugned judgment dismissed the appeal on the ground of delay. In our view, this is a fit case which should be heard by the Commissioner (Appeals) on merits.
2.  We, thus, set aside the order of the Tribunal as well as of the Commissioner (Appeals) and remit the matter back to the Commissioner (Appeals) to decide on merits.
3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
