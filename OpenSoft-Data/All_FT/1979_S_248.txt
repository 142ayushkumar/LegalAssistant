1.  In this appeal by special leave the appellant has been convicted u/s. 5(1)(c) read with S. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and sentence to four months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1, 000, in default eight months' rigorous imprisonment.
2.  We have heard learned counsel for the appellant who has argued that it was not a case of misappropriation but one of bona fide mistake in accounting. It appears that the appellant who was a District Fishery Officer was not at all conversant with accounts and while writing the cash book and the Consolidated Form and other documents he may have committed mistakes, but in view of the findings of the courts below there can be no doubt that the charge of mis-appropriation as found against him is proved beyond reasonable doubt.
3.   It however appears that the entire money which was said to have been embezzled by the appellant was recovered by the Government by deducting the entire amount from the salary of the appellant. It also appears from the statement of the accused u/s. 342 that in view of his domestic circumstances he was mentally disturbed. Having regard to these special circumstances and further having regard to the fact that the sum embezzled is only Rs. 130, we feel that it would not be proper to send the appellant back to jail. The appellant has already undergone about a week's imprisonment. For these reasons, therefore, we reduce the sentence to the period already served and reduce the fine from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 500, in default one month's rigorous imprisonment. Out of the fine, if deposited already, Rs. 500 may be refunded to the appellant. With this modification the appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
