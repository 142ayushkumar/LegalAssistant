4. CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 7016-7017 OF 2001: [arising out of S.L.P.(C) Nos. 5095-5096 of 1999] University of Agricultural Science Employees House Building Co-operative Society ..Appellant(s) vs. Special Land Acquisition Officer & Ors. ..Respondent(s) with CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 7021-7022 OF 2001 [arising out of S.L.P.(C) Nos. 5152-5153 of 1999] University of Agricultural Science Employees House Building Co-operative Society ..Appellant(s) vs.State of Karnataka & Ors. ..Respondent(s)
5.  In the instant case, the High Court came to the conclusion that the notification under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act had not been published within one year of the publication of Section 4 notification and for this purpose the High Court held that the relevant date of Section 6 notification was 23rd May, 1991 when it was in fact published in the Karnataka Gazette.
6. It is to be borne in mind that though Section 6 notification was published in the Gazette on 23rd May, 1991, the declaration under Section 6 was dated 9th May, 1991.
7.  Vide this Court's judgment dated 3rd October, 2001 in Civil Appeal No. 7077 of 2001 [arising out of SLP(C) No.22637 of 1997] entitled S.H. Rangappa vs. State of Karnataka and Anr., it has been held, differing from the view of the High Court, that the relevant date qua Section 6 notification is not the date of publication in the Gazette but the date of the declaration. In the instant case, that date would be 9th May, 1991.
8. It is keeping this in mind that the High Court should determine whether the notification was issued within one year of the publication of Section 4 notification.
9.  We, accordingly, allow these appeals, set aside the decision of the Division Bench and remand the cases for a fresh decision in accordance with law. It will be open to the parties to file affidavits indicating the starting point of limitation for the purposes of Section 6 notification.
Appeals disposed of.
