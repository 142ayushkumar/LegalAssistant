Sinter Plast Containers v Collector of Central Excise, Ahmedabad
Supreme Court of India

3 April 2003
C.A. No. 12732 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal, by the assessee, is against the order of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi dated 10-6-1996 in Final Order No. 382 of 1996-C in Appeal No. E/1533/94-C.
2.  The question that arises for consideration is, whether the amendment brought out to Chapter Note 6 is clarificatory in nature and, therefore, retrospective, or not clarificatory in nature and, therefore, prospective.
3.  A perusal of the order under appeal shows that the Tribunal decided the issue following the order of the Tribunal in the case of CCE v. Bright Bros. Ltd. (1996 Indlaw CEGAT 1065 : 1996 Indlaw CEGAT 1065) and remitted the case to the Commissioner to decide the question of MODVAT and valuation in the light of the decision of the larger Bench in the case of Dai Ichi Karkaria Dai Ichi Karkaria Ltd. v. CCE (1996 Indlaw CEGAT 1694)
4.  It is represented by the learned counsel for the appellant that in regard to the question of nature of the amendment, the view taken by the Tribunal in Bright Bros. Ltd. (1996 Indlaw CEGAT 1065 : 1996 Indlaw CEGAT 1065) has been reversed by the larger Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Das and Co. v. CCE (1997 Indlaw CEGAT 22280)
5.  Having perused the decision of the larger Bench in the case of Das and Co. (1997 Indlaw CEGAT 22280)
6. We are of the view that it would be appropriate to leave the question of the nature of the amendment to Chapter Note 6 also to the Commissioner who shall decide both the questions afresh, in the light of the aforementioned decision of the larger Benches of the Tribunal. The order under challenge is modified to that extent.
The civil appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
