Commissioner of Wealth Tax v Late Lokendra Singh Through Tehsildar, Ratlam
Supreme Court of India

8 February 2001
C.A. Nos. 9083 to 9086 of 1996
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The High Court declined to call for a reference, at the behest of the Revenue, of the following question:
"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case including in particular the fact that part of the official residence of the ex-ruler of Ratlam who is the assessee-respondent, stood let out, the Tribunal is justified in law in holding that the assessee is entitled to exemption of the value of the said property in its entirety under s. 5(1)(iii) of the WT Act, 1957 ?"
2.  It did so for the reason that, in its view, no question of law was raised. It appears, in fact, that the question was not referred because the answer was indicated by an earlier judgment of the High Court.
3.  A question of law does clearly arise. In fact, it is the submission of learned counsel for the Revenue that the answer to it is furnished by the judgment of this Court in Mohammad Ali Khan and Ors. vs. CWT 1997 Indlaw SC 25191997 Indlaw SC 2519.
We decline to decide the question here, particularly, since the respondent has not chosen to put in an appearance.
4.  We allow the appeals, set aside the order under challenge and direct the Tribunal to refer to the High Court the question aforestated, after drawing up a statement of case.
No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
