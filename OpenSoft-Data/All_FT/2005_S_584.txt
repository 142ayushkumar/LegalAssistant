11 April 2005
C.As. Nos. 2536-37 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 9471 - 72 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
We have heard counsel for the parties.
1.  Counsel for the appellant submitted, relying upon certain annexures filed in this proceeding, that his cousin (father's brother's son) one Kishore Shivajirao Jadhav has been given the certificate of validity by the Scheduled Tribe Certificate Scrutiny Committee, Aurangabad certifying him to belong to Thakur Scheduled Tribe. He, therefore, submits that he is also entitled to such a certificate.
2.  Counsel for the respondent submits that in the instant case, difficulties have arisen because the appellant chose not to represent his case before the Committee.
3.  However, in view of the subsequent developments we allow these appeals, set aside the impugned order of the High Court as well as that of the Scrutiny Committee and remit the matter to the Scheduled Tribe Certificate Scrutiny Committee, Aurangabad to reconsider the matter in the light of subsequent developments, including the fact that the paternal cousin of the appellant has been certified to belong to Thakur Scheduled Tribe.
4.  Counsel for the appellant submits that he will appear before the Scrutiny Committee within a period of two weeks from today with an appropriate application where after the Committee will proceed with the matter.
The appeals are disposed of in the above terms.
We express no opinion on the merit of the claim.
Appeals disposed of.
