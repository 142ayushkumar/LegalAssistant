Collector of Customs, Bombay v J. K. Synthetics and Limited
Supreme Court of India

26 September 1996
C.A. No. 4696 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The order under appeal passed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal on 6-9-1984 records thus:
"When the appeal was taken up Shri Ravinder Narain for the appellants mentioned that in view of the ratio of the judgment of this Tribunal in Order No. 516/84-C dated 2-8-1984 (Appeal No. CD (SB) (T) 7/77-C), this appeal has to be allowed. Shri A. S. Sunder Rajan, JDR for the respondent, agrees that it is so."
2.  On 9-7-1985, upon a rectification application filed by the respondents, the number of the notification in the order under appeal was corrected so as to read "Notification No. 8 of 1977 dated 24-1-1977" instead of "Notification No. 88 of 1973 dated 1-3-1972". The order dated 9-7-1985 records that the Departmental Representative, Mr. Sunder Rajan, did not oppose the application.
3.  The learned Additional Solicitor General now draws our attention to the terms of Notification No. 8 of 1977 and points out that for the exemption thereunder to apply it is necessary
"that the aforesaid caprolactum is intended to be used and is used for the production of polyamide (nylon) yarn of not above 225 deniers."
4.  We find that the Tribunal decided the matter upon the concession of the Departmental Representative appearing for the appellant that the appeal before the Tribunal had to be allowed in view of its earlier decision in Order No. 516/84-C dated 2-8-1984, the appeal against which, incidentally, this Court has dismissed on 24-9-1996 in Collector of Customs V. J. K. Synthetics Ltd. 1996 Indlaw SC 1091996 Indlaw SC 109.
5. Even when the respondents sought rectification of the order of the Tribunal, requiring the correct number and date of the said notification to be mentioned, the appellant did not wake up to the position now canvassed on their behalf.
6.  This may not be a concession on a point of fact which would bind the appellant, but it is, in the circumstances, not appropriate for us to interfere in appeal. It shall be open to the appellant to move the Tribunal in review or in such other manner as is deemed appropriate, if permissible in law, and the Tribunal may decide such application on its merits.
The appeal is dismissed, with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
