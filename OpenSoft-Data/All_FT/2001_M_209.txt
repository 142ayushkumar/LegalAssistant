Manisha Shikha Tani Welfare Trust and Others v Indian Bank and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18052/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Two suits filed on the Original Side of the High Court, between the same parties, were disposed of by learned Single Judge by a common judgment. Indian Bank, plaintiff in one suit, filed an appeal. Manisha Shikha Tani Welfare Trust (hereinafter, referred to as `the Trust') filed cross objections which were treated as appeal in the impugned judgment. The appeal filed by the Indian Bank was disposed of by the High Court.
2. So far as the cross objections filed by the Trust are concerned, having perused the memo of cross objections and the contents of the impugned judgment, we are satisfied that there has been no satisfactory disposal of several pleas raised in the cross objections.
3.  The grievance of the learned counsel for the Trust is that by the impugned judgment the cross objections were treated as appeal and there has been no hearing on the cross objections, converted into  appeal, by the impugned judgment. The fact that all the pleas raised in the cross objections and all the grounds set out therein have not been satisfactorily disposed of could not be seriously controverted by the learned counsel for the Indian Bank, though he tried to support the impugned judgment.
4.  For the foregoing reasons the appeal is partly allowed. Though the dismissal by the High Court of the appeal preferred by the Indian Bank is maintained, inasmuch as the Indian Bank has not chosen to file any SLP against the impugned judgment, the appeal by the Trust before the High Court is remanded for hearing and decision afresh on the cross objections preferred by the Trust. No order as to costs.
Appeal partly allowed.
