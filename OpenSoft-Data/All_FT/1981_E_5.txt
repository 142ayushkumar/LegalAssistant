Express Newspapers Ltd. v The State Of Madras
Supreme Court of India

19 February 1981
Civil Appeal No. 322 of 1970. From the Judgment and Decree dated 25-3-1969 of the Madras High Court in Appeal No. 1195 of 1970.
The Judgment was delivered by : A. D. Koshal, J.
1. A preliminary objection has been raised by Mr. Rangam to the effect that the certificate granted by the court under sub-cls. (a) and (c) of cl. (1) of Art. 133 of the Constitution of India, as it then stood, does not conform to legal requirements in as much as-
(a) it does not specify the substantial question of law which the High Court states require determination; and
(b) no reasons in support of the issuance of the certificate appear therein.
2. The preliminary objection is well founded in view of the decisions of this Court in Sohan Lal Naraindas v. Laxmidas Raghunath Gadit ([1971] 1 S.C.C. 276 1971 Indlaw SC 221) and in Sardar Bahadur S. Indra Singh Trust v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bengal ([1972] 1 S.C.R. 392 1971 Indlaw SC 237).
3. Faced with this situation Mr. Lalit wanted us to treat the appeal as one by special leave and prayed that such leave be granted now after condoning the delay. That would have been certainly a reasonable course to follow if it was made out that a substantial question of law really requires determination. We have gone through the impugned judgment and find that no such question is involved at all. We, therefore, refuse special leave, revoke the certificate granted by the High Court and dismiss the appeal but with no order as to costs.
