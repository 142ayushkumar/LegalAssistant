Romesh v Ramesh K. Rana and Others
Supreme Court of India

18 January 2000
C.A. No. 2718 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appellant was the returned candidate at the elections held to the Haryana Legislative Assembly. He was declared elected from 15, Gharaunda Constituency on 10-5-1996. The election of the appellant was challenged through an election petition filed by Respondent 1. There were no allegations of commission of any corrupt practice. The challenge was based on alleged improper reception and/or rejection of votes.
2. By an order dated 18-2-1999, the request of Respondent 1 for re-count of votes polled at the elections was accepted and certain directions were issued by the learned Designated Judge in the High Court of Punjab & Haryana. An order was made for re-count of the votes by the learned Designated Judge under the supervision and control of the District Judge (Vigilance), Punjab. After the re-count, the election of the appellant was set aside and Respondent 1 was declared duly elected. This appeal is by the aggrieved appellant.
3.  We have refrained from referring to the pleadings of the parties or the issues framed in the case because of the developments which have subsequently taken place.
On 14-12-1999, the Haryana Legislative Assembly has been dissolved.
4. Learned counsel for the appellant rightly submits that since there were no allegations of commission of any corrupt practice, with the dissolution of the Haryana Legislative Assembly, nothing further survives for consideration, at this point of time, insofar as this appeal is concerned. We agree.
5.  The appeal is hereby dismissed and the same is consigned to records. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
