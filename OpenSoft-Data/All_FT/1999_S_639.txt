State of Madhya Pradesh and Others v Steel Authority of India Limited
Supreme Court of India

15 September 1999
Review Petition No. 1221 of 1999 In Ca No. 5518 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is an application for review of our judgment in Steel Authority of India Ltd. v. State of M.P. 1999 Indlaw SC 1565
2.  There can be no review of the judgment dated 5-4-1999 1999 Indlaw SC 1565, on the basis of a subsequent judgment of the Court ECIL case  1999 Indlaw SC 1147 dated 5-5-1999, even assuming that the latter judgment is relevant on the question. Further exemption in ECIL case 1993 Indlaw SC 344 it was decided on merits that this was not a case of a contract for exemption entered into under executive power but this was a case of a contract executed under statutory power.
3. In the present case a specific statutory power for exemption was exercised. ECIL case  1999 Indlaw SC 1147 held that the Government's letter in that case was only an offer and created no estoppel against the statute but in that case no reliance was placed on any provision like Section 58 of the Code, which exempts cases of relief granted by way of contract.
4.  In the present case the letter is in the nature of an acceptance by the State Government of the request of the Central Government for exemption.We do not find any merit in the review petition. The same is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
