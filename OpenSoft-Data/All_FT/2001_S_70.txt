Saba Hussain v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

26 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 6755/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The conviction of the petitioner under Section 379 IPC has been upheld in appeal as well as by the High Court in Revision. The petitioner was found to be snatching Rs.1, 71, 000/- from a passenger in the bus and was caught red-handed. Mr. Gambhir, appearing for the petitioner contended that this is a case here the provisions of Section 360 CrPC should have been applied.
2.  From the judgment of revision it appears that the High Court did take into consideration the fact that the petitioner was a first offender and, therefore, reduced the sentence from three years to eighteen months.
3. It, therefore, cannot be contended that the Court did not bear in mind the provisions of Section 360 CrPC.
4.  We were, at one stage, inclined to issue notice of enhancement, but Mr. Gambhir says that he would not take the risk of taking notice of enhancement. The special leave petition accordingly stands dismissed.
Petition Dismissed.
