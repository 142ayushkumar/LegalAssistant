Hydro Chains Private Limited v Thomas T. Marattukalam (Dead) By LRs.
Supreme Court of India

3 February 1994
C.A. No. 721 of 1994 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 22029 of 1993)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  We have heard Mr. G. Ramaswamy learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner. It is no doubt correct that as at present there are two views prevailing in the Madras High Court on the applicability of Rule 25 of Madras Rent Control Rules.
2.   We, however, agree with and approve the view taken by Mr. Justice Raju in the impugned order in CRP No. 1513 of 1993, decided on 1-11-1993. The appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
