Boota Singh v Sher Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 March 1996
C.A. No. 925 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The appellant, Boota Singh, the unsuccessful candidate challenged the election of Respondent 1 Sher Singh to the Punjab Legislative Assembly on certain grounds including resort to corrupt practices. The allegation in regard to corrupt practices were set out in paras 8 to 12 of the appeal. The affidavit to Form 25 was also appended to the appeal. A preliminary objection was raised that the appeal was not maintainable inasmuch as the particulars regarding the corrupt practices had not been given and the copy of the affidavit in Form 25 was defective. The learned Single Judge in the High Court relying on the decisions of the High Courts of Bombay and Punjab and Haryana in Purushottam v. Returning Officer 1991 Indlaw MUM 6006 and Iqbal Singh v. Avtar Singh concluded that the appeal as well as the copy of the affidavit in Form 25 did not conform to the requirement of S. 31(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and, therefore, the appeal was liable to be dismissed. Reliance was also placed on the decision in Mithilesh Kumar Pandey v. Baidyanath Yadav 1984 Indlaw SC 1011984 Indlaw SC 101 and Rajendra Singh v. Usha Rani  1984 Indlaw SC 1141984 Indlaw SC 114, the former emphasising on the purity of elections and the latter emphasising on the respondent getting a correct copy of the document. Essentially, therefore, the view taken by the learned Single Judge was based on the earlier decision of the Court reported in Iqbal Singh case
2. Since then there have been pronouncements of this Court which were considered by this Court in an elaborate judgment rendered in the case of F. A. Sapa v. Singora  1991 Indlaw SC 246In this decision, the earlier decision of this Court including the one in Murarka Radhey Shyam Ram Kumar v. Roop Singh Rathore 1963 Indlaw SC 1521963 Indlaw SC 152 and Manphul Singh v. Surinder Singh 1973 Indlaw SC 109 as well as K. M. Mani v. P. J. Antony 1978 Indlaw SC 1141978 Indlaw SC 114 were relied on. This decision was rendered after the decision of the Bombay High Court came to be reported but before the decision of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Iqbal Singh case The judgment in Iqbal Singh case does not refer to the decision of this Court in F. A. Sapa case 1991 Indlaw SC 246. We are, therefore, inclined to think that the High Court omitted to consider the question regarding the impact of S. 81(3) of the Representation of the People Act in the light of the ratio and observations of this Court in F. A. Sapa case 1991 Indlaw SC 246.
3. We, therefore, think it appropriate to remit the matter to the High Court for disposal after considering the impact of the decision in F A. Sapa case 1991 Indlaw SC 246 as well as the earlier decision of this Court referred to therein.
4. In the result, we set aside the impugned order, remit the matter back to the High Court and direct the High Court to reconsider the entire matter afresh in the light of what we have stated above. The appeal will stand disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
