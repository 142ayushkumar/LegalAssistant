Jaswinder Singh and Others v Gram Panchayat, Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9099/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the High Court has committed an obvious error saying that the case is squarely covered by the decision of this Court in Gram Panchayat, Nurpur vs. State of Punjab and Others 1996 Indlaw SC 1684. This submission is made on the assumption that the land is not Shamlat Deh but only Shamlat land. It is for the petitioners to move the High Court in review if the aforesaid plea is correct.
2. We permit the petitioners to move the review petition in the High Court. If any such application for review is filed within 30 days from today in that case the same shall be entertained notwithstanding the delay involved. With these observations this Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
