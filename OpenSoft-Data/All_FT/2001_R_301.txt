Reliance Industries Limited v Collector of Customs, Mumbai
Supreme Court of India

14 March 2001
C.A. No. 2364 of 2000 (Arising as an appeal from 2000 (118) E.L.T. 643 (Tribunal), see also 2000 (119) E.L.T. A240)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We have heard learned counsel. We do not think that this is a case in which this court should set aside the order of the Tribunal merely because it does not reflect very precisely the reasoning upon which it has held on one issue against the present appellant. It is clear that the present appellant intended to make the import under Chapter 84 of the Customs Act and not as a project import. It is only after the first show cause notice in respect of a part of the import was issued that a certificate was obtained from the Directorate General of Technical Development which approved of the project import.
2. It is clear that, in the circumstances, the requirements of the Project Imports Regulations, 1986 have not been met.
In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed.
No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
