Gyansagar v Ganesh Gupta and Another
Supreme Court of India

11 July 2005
Cr. Appeal No. 806 of 2005 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 5869 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The accused and the complainant are represented through their counsel. A joint application has been filed for compounding the offence under Section 147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. In the application it is stated that the amount due has been paid.
Necessary figures are disclosed in paragraph 10 of the application for compounding the offence. The application is supported by affidavits of the accused as well as the complainant.
2. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that the parties should be permitted to compound the offence since the parties state that nothing is outstanding from the appellant since the amount due has been paid in full.
3.  We, therefore, permit the paries to compound the offence, and set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant. The appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
