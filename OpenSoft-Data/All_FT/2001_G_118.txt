Government of N.C.T. of Delhi and Anr v B.L. Saini
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8096/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we are of the view that the High Court ought not to have entertained this writ petition, especially when the matter pertaining to the closure of the polluting units in non-conforming areas is pending in this Court. Mr. Rajiv Dutta, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent (writ petitioner) states that he will withdraw the writ petition which is pending in the High Court.
2. While allowing this appeal and setting aside the impugned order of the High Court, we also allow the respondent to move an application before the High Court for withdrawal of the writ petition. After the withdrawal of the same, the respondent will be at liberty to take such other legal steps as may be open to him in law.
Appeal allowed.
