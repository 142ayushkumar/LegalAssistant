P. Parameswaran and others v Secretary to The Government of India
Supreme Court of India

5 December 1986
W.P. No. 1888 of 1978
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioners who were Field Publicity Officers, Grade IV, were upgraded to Grade III, pursuant to the recommendations of the Third Pay Commission. The scale of salary was also revised but effect was given to the revision from October 1, 1975, instead of from January 1, 1973, as in the case of all other persons. It has been pointed out in the writ petition that in the case of Field Publicity Officers (Border) effect was given to the revised grade and scales from January 1, 1973. These facts are admitted in the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the government but it is stated that the petitioners could not be given the revised scales with effect from January 1, 1973, on account of some administrative difficulties.
2. We do not think that it is open to the government to deny the benefit of the revised grade and scale with effect from January 1, 1973, as in the case of all other persons merely because of some administrative difficulties. To do so will be discriminatory. A direction will, therefore, issue to the respondents to give effect to the revised grade and scales from January 1, 1973, to the petitioners. Writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
