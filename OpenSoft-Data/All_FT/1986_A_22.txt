Advocates' Association, High Court, Madras v State of Tamil Nadu and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 December 1986
Civil Misc. Petition Nos. 27192-93 of 1986 in W.P. No. 128 of 1986.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On the last occasion my Lord the Chief Justice and Ranganath Misra, J. made a suggestion that supernumerary posts may be created by the State Government to accommodate those temporary Judicial Second Class Officers who may be found fit but who cannot be regularised for want of adequate number of posts. This suggestion was accepted by the State Government. The court, however, did not want to embody the suggestion in the form of an order without obtaining the opinion of the High Court. The High Court's opinion was.
2.   The High Court without appreciating the suggestion made by the Court to resolve a difficult situation has now informed us that the suggestion would be opposed to the concept of regularisation. Without entering into further discussion on the question we make the suggestion made last time an order of the court. The government may proceed to create the necessary number of supernumerary posts for the purpose of accommodating the Judicial Officers Second Class who may be found to be fit but who cannot be regularised immediately. The civil miscellaneous petitions are disposed of accordingly.
Petitions disposed of.
