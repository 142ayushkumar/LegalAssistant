The order of the Court was as follows:
Delay is condoned.
1.  On the contentions being raised that the second appeal filed in the High Court was not under Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code but was under Section 41 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1914, we directed the petitioner to file an affidavit to that effect. Inspite of giving many opportunities no affidavit was filed.
2.  We do not find any illegality in the order of the High Court to warrant our interference under Article 136 of the Constitution.The SLP is therefore dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
