20 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)....../2000 (CC:7762)
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Advocate, on instructions, submits that a Commission of Inquiry has been appointed vide a Notification dated 16th November, 2000 after the impugned order of the High Court dated 24th April, 2000 and that Commission of Inquiry was given six months time to submit its report.
2. However, it has made no progress because even the office has not been set up and this delay would be prejudicial to enquire into the subject matter which is of serious concern as it involves security of the State. He submits that the petitioner may be permitted to withdraw this special leave petition so as to bring all these factors to the notice of the High Court.
3.  We record the statement of learned counsel and dismiss the special leave petition as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
