Gulab Waman Patil v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

28 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3081/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Appellant is one of the many accused against whom offences under Sections 307 and 452 etc. have been charge-sheeted by the police. He was arrested on 7.2.2000 and is continuing in jail till now. He moved for bail but the same was rejected by the trial court and the High Court twice.
2.  The main reason for not granting him bail is that he was absconding for a lengthy period. Though the explanation is offered for not surrendering earlier we are not interested in entering a finding whether the explanation is right or not.
3. We asked learned counsel for the State as to whether there is any particular reason for keeping this appellant as an undertrial prisoner for any further period. We are not satisfied of any good reason for this appellant alone to be detained in prison, particularly when all his co-accused have been released on bail.
4.  We, therefore, order that appellant be released on bail on executing a bond for such amount as the trial judge may fix with two solvent sureties to the satisfaction of the trial judge. We further direct that the appellant shall report to Parola Police Station, Taluka Parola, District Jalgaon, Maharashtra on all alternate Mondays between 4.00 p.m. and 7.00 p.m. until further orders. This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
