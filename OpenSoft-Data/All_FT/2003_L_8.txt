State of Haryana and others v Lakhender Prakash (dead)
Supreme Court of India

30 January 2003
C.A. No. 4823 of 2000 (Along with C.A. No. 5769 of 2000)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard the learned counsel for the parties. Lakhender Prakash filed a civil suit for declaration that the order of termination of his services was illegal and bad and also for consequential reliefs. The trial court decreed the suit. The first appellate court confirmed the decree passed by the trial court. The State challenged the judgment and decree of the first appellate court affirming the order of the trial court in a second appeal.
2. The High Court, after after hearing learned counsel for the parties, partly allowed the second appeal. Hence both the State as well as Lakhender Prakash have filed these appeals to the extent they are aggrieved by the judgment passed in the second appeal.
3.  The learned counsel for the parties made submissions in support of their respective contentions. But, having perused the impugned judgment, we find that neither any substantial question of law was framed nor it was considered in the impugned judgment. This Court has repeatedly and consistently held that in order to entertain a second appeal under Section 100 C.P.C., it is necessary that a substantial question of law should arise for consideration between the parties.
4.  In this view, without expressing one way or the other on the merits of the respective contentions of learned counsel, we think it just and appropriate to set aside the impugned order and remit the matter to the High Court to restore the second appeal (R.S.A. No. 1571/1994) and then dispose it of, after considering whether any substantial question of law arises for consideration. The impugned judgment is set aside and the appeals are ordered accordingly. No costs .
Order accordingly.
