Hotline Teletubes and Components Limited and others v State of Bihar and another
Supreme Court of India

4 November 2004
Cr.A. No. 1225 of 2002
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal by special leave has been filed by the appellants against the order passed by the Patna High Court, refusing to quash their prosecution under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code (for short "IPC"). In the complaint petition, it has been alleged that the complainant supplied goods to the accused persons, but they failed to pay the price therefor. There is no whisper in the complaint that at the very inception of the contract between the parties, there was any intention to cheat.
2. It appears from a bare perusal of the complaint that it is a case of purely civil liability and no criminal offence is disclosed, much less offences either under Section 406 or 420 IPC. So far as the High Court is concerned, it has not considered this aspect of the matter, but has refused to quash the prosecution observing that it was a fit case where parties should take steps for settlement. In our view, allowing such prosecution to continue would amount to an abuse of the process of court and to prevent the same, it would be just and expedient to quash the same.
3.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and prosecution of the appellants is hereby quashed.
Appeal allowed.
