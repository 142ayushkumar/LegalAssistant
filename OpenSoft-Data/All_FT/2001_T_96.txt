Thakur Dass v Bhagwan Dass and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 August 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2781 OF 2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  It is conceded by the counsel for the parties that the term for which the respondent was elected is going to expire in January, 2002 and the fresh election for constituting the Corporation may take place any time before January, 2002 and as such no useful purpose would be served in deciding the matter on merits.
In view of above, this appeal is dismissed as having rendered infructuous, leaving the question of law open to be decided in an appropriate case.
Appeal dismissed.
