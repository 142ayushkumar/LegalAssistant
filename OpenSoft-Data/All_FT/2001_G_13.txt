G.C. H. Mikayelu v State of Goa and Anr
Supreme Court of India

27 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 214/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing both sides, we feel that the question of bail in this case can be considered after the examination of eye witnesses in the Sessions Court. We direct the petitioner to move the Sessions Court on completion of examination of eye-witnesses. We also direct the Sessions Judge concerned to expedite the trial proceedings, particularly, examination of the eye-witnesses. We are told that the case would be committed to the Sessions Court in the course of this week or so.
2.  Soon after the case is committed to the Sessions Court, the case shall be posted for the steps contemplated in Sections 226 and 227 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. If the charge is to be framed, the Sessions Judge shall post the case for examination of the eye-witnesses within one month thereafter.
With these observations, we dispose of this special leave petition.
Petition disposed of.
