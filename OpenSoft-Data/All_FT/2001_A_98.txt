M.P. Arya Mohan Prakash Arya v Air India Limited
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...1229/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere in the matter in question. Mr.Ranjan Mukherjee, learned counsel for the petitioner also, at the commencement of hearing submitted that he has been instructed to withdraw this Special Leave Petition with further instruction to file the same before the High Court. But Mr.Mukherjee, however, further contended that the embargo of limitation has some effect in the matter.
2.  Mr.V.B.Joshi, learned counsel appearing for the respondent, on caveat, submitted that, though his client may not have any objection as regards the limitation, the matter ought to be left with the discretion of the High Court.
3. In our view, the same would also be in the fitness of things and as such we are not expressing anything on the merits of the case. With the above observations, the Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
