State of Uttar Pradesh v Govind Mandal
Supreme Court of India

9 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1016/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The impugned order is one by which the High Court declined to grant leave to appeal against an order of acquittal in a murder case.
2. After going through the statement of facts in this case we are of the opinion that the High Court should have considered the appeal of the State on merits after granting leave to appeal.
We, therefore, set aside the impugned order.
Leave applied for will stand granted.
The appeal before the High Court is thus regularised.
3. It is for the High Court to dispose of the appeal on merits.
This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
