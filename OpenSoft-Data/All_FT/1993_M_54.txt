State of Karnataka v Mangmant Fakirappa Sarajad and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 August 1993
Cr.As. Nos. 226-227 of 1979
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  These two appeal are filed by the State of Karnataka against the judgment of the High Court of Karnataka. There are altogether 12 respondents before us. All of them were tried for offence punishable under Sections 148, 302/149, 325/149, 323/149 and 336/149, Indian Penal Code. The trial Court convicted A-2, A-3, A-4, A-7, A-8, A-11 and A-12 under Sections 148, 302, 325 and 323/149, Indian Penal Code. The rest were acquitted. The convicted accused preferred an appeal and the State questioning the acquittal of the other accused also filed an appeal. Both the appeals were disposed of by a common judgment.
The High Court, after appreciating the evidence and contentions advanced on behalf of the convicted accused, as well as on behalf of the State, however, confirmed the acquitted A-1, A-5, A-6, A-9 and A-10 and also set aside the conviction of the other accused under S. 302, Indian Penal Code and acquitted them of all the charges, except A-4, A-7 and A-8 and their conviction in respect of minor offence and sentence awarded thereunder were only confirmed. Questioning the same, the State has filed these two appeals.
2.  The protection case is that one Shankaragouda of Ugargol village married to one Yallava, expired leaving behind two daughter, viz., Balavva and Durgavva. One of the daughters Balavva was married to a person of Manpur and Lurgavva - another daughter was married to a person of Unabal. His second wife, Parvatevva the widow of death Shankaragouda had no issue living. After the death of Yallava - the first wife, Shankaragouda married to Parvatevva who had been suffering from paralytical stroke. Shankaragouda requested one Ramangouda (P.W. 20), a relative, to take Parvatevva - his second wife, to Hubli, for treatment and accordingly he took her to Hubli. Shankaragouda in the meanwhile bequeathed his property in favour of the wife of A-1 under a will and he executed a general power of attorney in favour of A-1.
3.  P.W. 20, Ramangouda came back to the village and Parvatevva, the second wife of Shankaragouda wanted to take Ramangouda to Belgaum to meet the Superintendent of Police and she finally lodged a complaint sating that her husband's life was in danger. The Superintendent of Police forwards the complaint to the local police - the PSI (P.W. 34). A Panchnama was taken and arrangements were made to send Shankaragouda to the house of Parvatevva. Shankaragouda then annulled the will and executed a fresh will. He also cancelled the general power of attorney made in favour of A-1. This led to misunderstanding. Shankaragouda expired on 31-12-75. There was a grudge going on between P.W. 20 and A-1 and as a result of which two parties came into existence in the village - one led by A-1 and the other by P.W. 20. The party belonging to P.W. 20 consisted of P.Ws. 2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 13 and others.
4. The other remaining accused were alleged to be members of A-1's party. On 21-4-1977, at about 2 p.m. P.W. 3 stood on front of the house of A-1 and started abusing him. P.W. 1 took P.W. 3 away from that place and went towards Paraveshwar Temple and left him there. A-1 was armed with a revolver, A-7 with cycle chain and others armed with sticks and also with stones etc. There a clash took place and it is stated that A-2 gave a blow with the handbar and when Parasappa, one one of the deceased persons, was running, all other accused, including the respondents chased him, overtook him and ultimately beat him with deadly weapons. P.W. 16 - the police constable on seeing the incident rushed to the spot and all the accused ran away on seeing him. Then, P.W. 16, the constable went to the village to send a telephonic message to the police. When P.W. 16 reached Bennikatti, he found Nagappa, the other deceased, who was already assaulted near the temple. It is alleged that the accused attacked Nagappa and in that occurrence three witnesses. - P.Ws. 11, 12 and 13 were there.
5.  The post-mortem was conducted on the two dead bodies and the injured witnesses were also examined by the doctor. Investigation was also completed, as usual. P.W. 32 - the head constable, who received the message informed P.W. 34, the PSI Gokat. A search was conducted and articles, were recovered and the accused were arrested. A charge-sheet was laid. The accused denied the offence and pleaded that they were falsely implicated.
6.  The prosecution examined P.Ws. 4, 8, 10, 16 and 20 as eyewitnesses to the assault on the two deceased. They are the very witnesses who spoke of the attack on P.Ws. 11, 12 and 13. P.Ws. 5, 8, and 10 were treated as hostile. The Sessions Court disbelieved the evidence of P.Ws. 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16 and 20 and the evidence of P.W. 5 was reliable as against A-2, A-3, A-11 and A-12 only while holding that A-4, A-7 and A-8 were also guilty of offence punishable under S. 302/149, Indian Penal Code. The Sessions Judge also disbelieved the evidence of P.Ws. 11, 12 and 13 as against A-4, A-7 and A-8, but convicted them on the general ground that they were the members of unlawful assembly, which attracts S. 302/149, Indian Penal Code. On the same analogy, the learned Sessions judge convicted the other seven accused also.
7.  Before the High Court, it was argued on behalf of the convicted accused that the learned Sessions Judge having disbelieved P.W. 5 partly ought not to have relied on his evidence and on the very same reasoning A-4, A-7, and A-8 ought not to have been convicted. The Govt. pleader on behalf of the State argued that the Sessions Judge ought not to have disbelieved the evidence of P.Ws. 4, 6 and 16. The High Court considered the evidence of P.Ws. 4, 5, 6, 15, 16 and 32 in great detail. It has pointed out several discrepancies and also observed that it highly unsafe to rely on their evidence.
8. In this context, the High Court also took into consideration the fact that P.W. 18 - the doctor, who admitted Nagappa - the deceased, told the Court that he did not mention the name of the accused and later Nagappa - one of the deceased, improved his version not falling in line with the general prosecution case. Another important aspect noted by High Court is that P.W. 20, who was the leader of the opposite party, came forward with his improved version and made complaint long after the incident and it is highly unsafe to go by his evidence.
9.  We have perused the record and we find that the witnesses improved their evidence which does fall in line with the actual version of the incident as put forward by P.W. 20, and, specially, in a case of this nature, where omnibus allegations are made, it is highly unsafe to interfere particularly in an appeal against acquittal. The appeals fail and the same are dismissed accordingly.
Appeals dismissed.
