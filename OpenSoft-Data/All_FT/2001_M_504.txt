St. Domnic's Education Society v Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19582/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is not disputed that the land was earmarked for the park. In that view of the matter the area could not have leased out for any other purpose other than the park.
2. We are in agreement with the view taken by the High Court.
The special leave petition is accordingly, dismissed.
3.  It was then urged by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner is running an Institution there and, therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is reasonable. We, accordingly, direct that the petitioner shall not be evicted from the premises till 30th July, 2002 provided they file a usual undertaking to this effect within four weeks from today, failing which this order shall automatically stand vacated without further reference to the Court. I.A. No. 1 is also dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
