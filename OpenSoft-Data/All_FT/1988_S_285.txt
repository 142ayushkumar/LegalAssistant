Sultan Singh v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

4 April 1988
Cr.A. No. 209 of 1988 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 2148 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Special leave granted limited to the question of sentence only. Having regard to the several feature of this case including the fact that the appellant has married the prosecutrix as stated by the learned counsel for the appellant, we feel that the sentence imposed on the appellant should be reduced to the sentence of imprisonment already undergone by him.
2.   We accordingly modify the judgment of the High Court insofar as the question of sentence is concerned.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
