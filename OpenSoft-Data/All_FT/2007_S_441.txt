Bandi Chandraiah v State Represented By Its SHO, Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

22 March 2007
Cr.A. No. 1102 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The sole appellant was convicted by the trial court u/s. 304 Part II of the Penal Code and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years. On appeal being preferred, the High Court confirmed his conviction. Hence, this appeal by special leave.
2.  The conviction of the appellant is based upon three dying declarations; one recorded by the police at the earliest point of time, the second by the Revenue Mandal Officer; and the third by the Magistrate. All the three dying declarations are consistent. In our view, the High Court was quite justified in upholding the conviction of the appellant; as such, no ground for interference is made out.
The criminal appeal, accordingly, fails and the same is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
