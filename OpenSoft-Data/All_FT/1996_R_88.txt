C.A. No. .... of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 11322 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant who was then the student of Class VIII and aged about 15 years, met with an accident by a truck. There is no dispute that he suffered serious injuries and one kidney had to be removed. The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Dhar, awarded an amount of Rs.24,000 which was enhanced by the High Court to Rs.48,000. After hearing counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the High Court should have awarded an amount of Rs.1,00,000 (Rs. one lakh) as compensation to the appellant.
2.   Accordingly, we allow this appeal and direct that an amount of Rs.1,00,000 (Rs one lakh) be paid to the appellant as compensation. The balance amount should be deposited within four weeks before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Dhar, M.P., in Claim Case No.44 of 1980. The appellant shall withdraw the said balance amount.
No costs.
Appeal allowed.
