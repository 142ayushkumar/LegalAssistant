State of Bihar and another v Gauri Shankar Mishra (Dead) By Lrs.
Supreme Court of India

18 April 2005
C.As. No. 2722 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 4104 of 2005) with No. 2720 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 4105 of 2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The State is aggrieved by an order passed by the High Court whereby the High Court refused to stay the proceedings of the execution court in a land acquisition matter. We see from the impugned order that the execution court has directed issuance of warrants against the judgment-debtor. We are afraid, as to how the court issued warrants of arrest in a land acquisition matter.
2. We hereby set aside the order of arrest passed by the execution court. The execution court is at liberty to proceed with the execution proceedings if there is no stay of proceedings by any superior court.
The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
