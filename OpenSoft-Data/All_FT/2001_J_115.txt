Joint Commissioner of Income Tax v Reliable Carriers Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

19 February 2001
C.A. No. 1344 of 2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  By the order under challenge, the High Court declined to entertain an appeal in respect of the following question:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the Tribunal was justified in law in upholding the decision of the learned CIT(A) deleting the addition of Rs. 3, 12, 589 even when the decision relied on by the CIT(A) were not accepted by the Department and R.A. under s. 256(2) stood admitted by the Hon'ble High Court for asst. yr. 1986-87 on the issue under consideration ?"
2.  The High Court was of the view that no substantial question of law arose.
3. The High Court had, on an application by the Revenue under s. 266(2) of the IT Act, called upon the Tribunal to refer to it the identical issue in respect of a previous year.
4.  It is fairly stated, in the circumstances, that this appeal should be allowed, the order under challenge should be set aside and the appeal (ITA No. 7 of 1999) restored to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits along with the IT reference (IT Ref. Nos. 40, 42 and 43 of 1995) It is so ordered.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
