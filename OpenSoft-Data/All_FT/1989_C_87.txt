Rama Bai and Others v Commissioner of Income Tax, Andhra Pradesh Hyderabad and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 November 1989
Tax Reference Nos. 3 of 1976 and 1-3 of 1978 with C.As. Nos. 810 of 1974, 3027 of 1988 etc
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question involved in these cases is regarding the point of time at which the interest payable under sections 28 and 34 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (I of 1894), accrues or arises, where such interest is paid on enhanced compensation awarded on a reference under section 18 of the said Act or further appeal to the High Court and/or the Supreme Court. Some of the matters before us are appeals and some are references under section 257 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. These references were made directly to this court in view of the fact that there was a conflict of decisions among the High Courts on the above issue. We do not think it is necessary to refer to those decisions because we find that the question at issue is now concluded by the decision of this court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Govindarajulu Chetty, 1987 Indlaw SC 28818.
2.   Though the judgment is a short one, it deals directly with the point in issue. It is also clear from a perusal of the judgment of the High Court in T. N. K. Govindarajulu Chetty v. CIT, 1972 Indlaw MAD 60 (Mad), which was upheld by the Supreme Court in this matter, that the issue has been considered by this court in all its aspects. The principle of the decision also derives support from the earlier decision of this court in Khorshed Shapoor Chenai v. Asst. CED, 1979 Indlaw SC 174. In these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the appeals before us (Civil Appeal No. 810 of 1974 and Civil Appeal No. 3027 of 1988) have to be allowed and the references made under section 257 (Tax Reference Cases Nos. 3 of 1976 and 1 to 3 of 1978) have to be answered by saying that the question of accrual of interest will have to be determined in accordance with the above decision of this court.
3.  The effect of the decision, we may clarify, is that the interest cannot be taken to have accrued on the date of the order of the court granting enhanced compensation but has to be taken as having accrued year after year from the date of delivery of possession of the lands till the date of such orderThese matters are disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
4.  Civil Miscellaneous Petitions Nos. 14921 - 25 of 1978 in C. A. No. 810 of 1974 : The petitions have already been allowed and we have also heard Sri T. A. Ramachandran, Senior Advocate, appearing for them. No further orders are necessary on these petitions.
5.  Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 11123 of 1973 in C. A. No. 810 of 1974 : We have been informed that the vakalatnama has since been filed. No further order is necessary on this petition.
Order accordingly.
