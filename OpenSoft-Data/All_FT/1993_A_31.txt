Additional Commissioner of Income Tax v M. Karthikeyan
Supreme Court of India

24 February 1993
C.A. No. 1330 of 1982
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is preferred against the judgment of the Madras High Court answering the question referred to it, at the instance of the Revenue, against the Revenue. The question referred is:
"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the assessee's share in the partnership firm of M/s Erode Service constituted a separate and individual property and not the property of the joint family consisting of himself and his five sons?"
2.  One Angappa Mudaliar had five sons including the assessee. There was a complete partition among Angappa Mudaliar and his five sons in the year 1943. The said partition was also accepted and recorded by the Income Tax Department under Section 25-A of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922. Angappa Mudaliar died on January 25, 1962 leaving behind him certain assets. The question is whether the share obtained by the assessee in his father's assets in his separate property ? The High Court has answered it saying that it is governed by S. 8 of Hindu Succession Act and therefore the said share is his separate property. This question has since been concluded by the decision of this Court in CWT v. Chander Sen, 1986 Indlaw SC 1721986 Indlaw SC 1721986 Indlaw SC 172 which has also been followed in CIT v. P. L. Karuppan Chettiar 1992 Indlaw SC 7051992 Indlaw SC 705.
3. It is held that in such circumstances the share obtained by the son is governed by S. 8 of Hindu Succession Act and therefore his separate property. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
