Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

29 September 1989
Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 27230 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This miscellaneous application is by a mining lessee in the Doon Valley area whose right to mining came to an end in view of the judgment of this Court on August 30, 1988,  with effect from September 30, 1988. He had applied for review of the judgment but the same was rejected on December 1, 1988, whereafter the present petition has been filed with a prayer that on grounds of justice, equity and compassion he may be permitted to continue mining operations for a period of three months more.
2.   Mining in this area excepting in the few cases specifically permitted has been stopped by the judgment of this Court dated August 30, 1988. The petitioner has actually been given a month's time to close down his mining activity.
Allowing further mining in the area would not be in the environmental and ecological interest.
This application is accordingly dismissed.
Application dismissed.
