Babu Singh and Others v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

14 December 1994
Cr.A. No. 111 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Though the appellants, three in number along with Lila Singh, stood trial under Sections 307/34 I.P.C. and other ancillary offences. the trial court convicted them under Sections 324/34 I.P.C. for having caused injuries to Kaur Singh, Jiwan Singh and Harbans Singh, PWs.
2. On appeal by the State, however, the conviction was altered. All the four accused were convicted under Section 307/34 IPC but Lila Singh substantially for the offence under Section 307 IPC, and were imposed sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment. On joint special leave petition to this Court, Lila Singh was declined leave whereas the appellants were granted, in view of the judgment and order of the High Court, applying Section 34 IPC
3.  We have heard learned counsel. The injury from which murderous assault could be spelt out was attributed to Lila Singh. The other injuries on the injured persons were simple in nature. It is difficult, in the facts and circumstances of this case, to conclude that all the four accused had common intention of murderous assault on the PWs. It can otherwise be spelt out that they had a common intention but of a lesser offence, i.e. under Section 324 IPC.
4. Thus, we alter the conviction of the three appellants alone to one under Sections 324/34 IPC as recorded by the trial court. But instead of requiring them to execute a bond as did the trial court we would reduce their sentence to the period already undergone under all counts. To this extent, the appeal stands allowed. Disposed of accordingly
Appeal disposed of
