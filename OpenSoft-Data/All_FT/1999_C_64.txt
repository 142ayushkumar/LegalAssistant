Cit, Bhopal v Eastern Electro Chemical Industries
Supreme Court of India

13 August 1999
C.A. No. 4589 of 1999 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 15551 of 1998), Dt. 13 August 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Looking to the facts, circumstances, and the nature of the subsidy, which is a power subsidy based on a percentage of electricity bills, it is clear that the subsidy is to meet a certain percentage of expenditure on power. The receipt is, therefore, revenue in nature and is covered by the decision of this Court in Sahney Steel and Press Works Ltd. v. CIT  1997 Indlaw SC 1527.
2. The appeal is allowed accordingly. There will, however, be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
