Arun Madan v Oriental Bank of Commerce
Supreme Court of India

25 February 1987
C.A. No. 442 of 1982
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The order of termination of the service of the appellant was passed before the respondent-Bank was nationalised.
2. The High Court was therefore right in holding that a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution was not maintainable against an order made when the Bank was a public limited company.
3. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
