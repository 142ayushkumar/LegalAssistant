Digambar v Trimbak
Supreme Court of India

13 October 2008
CIVIL APPEAL NO.6086 OF 2008 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.8039/2007)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1. By the impugned order, High Court allowed the second appeal pending before it without formulating substantial question of law which is mandatory in case any substantial question of law arises in such an appeal. As no such question of law has been framed, impugned order is fit to be set aside on this ground alone.
2.  Accordingly, civil appeal is allowed, impugned order rendered by the High Court is set aside and the second appeal is remitted to the High Court to be disposed of afresh after formulating substantial question of law, if any.
Appeal allowed
