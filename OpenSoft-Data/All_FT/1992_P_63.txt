Malhotra Steel Syndicate v Punjab Chemi-Plants Limited
Supreme Court of India

14 July 1992
C.A. No. 2587 of 1992, (Arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) No. 19170 of 1991)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard both the counsels. We have looked at the form and verification of the affidavit filed before the High Court in support of the application for winding-up. We are satisfied that the verification, on a proper and liberal construction, does contain an averment to the effect that the statements made in the affidavit are true and correct to the knowledge of the appellant.
2.   We do not think that the affidavit can be described as defective in any respect. But that apart, we are of the opinion that even if there is some slight defect or irregularity in the filing of the affidavit, the appellant should have been given an opportunity to rectify the same.
3.  We are therefore, of the opinion that the Division Bench was in error in dismissing the appeal on the short ground that the affidavit filed in support of the petition was not in proper form and that the petition could not be entertained.
We therefore, set aside the order of the Division Bench dated August 21, 1991.
4.  In the result, the Company appeal will stand revived before the Division bench for disposal on merits.
5.  The appeal is allowed accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
