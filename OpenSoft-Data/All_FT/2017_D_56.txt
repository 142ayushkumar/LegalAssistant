1. Leave granted.
2. In the nature of the order we propose to pass, it is not necessary to issue notice to the respondents. The appellants approached the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing a complaint filed in the year 2013. It appears that there are several litigations between the members of the family and the complaint of the year 2013 is one among them.
3. Be that as it may, since the Magistrate is in seisin of the matter, it will be appropriate that the appellants surrender before the Magistrate Court and cooperate with the trial. This appeal is, hence, disposed of with a direction that the appellants shall surrender before the Magistrate of competent jurisdiction and on such surrender, they will be released on bail on furnishing bail bonds to the tune of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) each, with two solvent sureties each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Magistrate Court.
Order accordingly
