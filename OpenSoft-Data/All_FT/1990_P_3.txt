P. J. Sunderrajan and Another v Unit Trust of India and Another
Supreme Court of India

30 October 1990
C.A. No. 5026/1990,
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Special leave granted.
1.  Heard parties. We have perused the records. We are of the view that the departmental enquiry should be stayed till the trial which is stated to be pending in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Madras is completed. The enquiry shall accordingly stand stayed. However, it will be open to the respondents to proceed with the enquiry, if they so choose, after the Trial Court has rendered its judgment, whether or not any appeal is taken from that judgment to a higher court. We are told that the trial has been pending since May, 1989, and many witnesses have already been examined. Accordingly we except the Trial Court to complete the trial within three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.
2.  In the circumstances, the appeal is disposed of with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
