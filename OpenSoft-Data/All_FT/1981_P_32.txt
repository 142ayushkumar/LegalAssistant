Govind Sharan Aggarwal v Pt. Hardeo Sharma Trived
Supreme Court of India

5  May  1981
Cr.A. No. 497 of 1981.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard counsel for the parties.
1.  Having regard to the very peculiar and special circumstances of this case without casting any reflection on the District Judge, we think that the apprehension of the appellant that he will not get fair trial at the hands of Mr. Kainthla cannot be said to be unreasonable. One of the factors that have weighed with us was that in a civil suit this very judge had granted a huge cost of Rs. 5000 as lawyer's fee and a sum of Rs. 15000 as lawyer's fee in an interlocutory matter.
2. This is a rather very extraordinary course that seems to have been adopted by the learned Judge. He may or may not be justified in this, but if the appellant has an apprehension on this score, it cannot be said that his apprehension is not well-founded.
3.  For this reason, we allow this appeal and direct that the case be transferred to the Court of District and Sessions Judge, Simla. Parties are directed to appear before him on June 15, 1981 and the appellant undertakes to appear before the Simla court on that day.
4.  In this view of the matter, the order of the High Court regarding breach of undertaking and issue of warrants, etc., become otiose.
Appeal allowed.
