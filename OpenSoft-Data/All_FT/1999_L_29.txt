Union of India v Livia Exports
Supreme Court of India

3 December 1999
C.A. No. 6956 of 1999 (Arising as an appeal from Rajasthan High Court DBMSA 1805, Dt. 21 May 1999)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The respondent has filed a writ petition in the Rajasthan High Court at Jaipur wherein he has challenged certain notices and summons which have been issued by officers of the petitioners. In the impugned order rule was issued by the High Court and it directed the stay of further proceedings in the investigation.
2.  Without going into the question whether the High Court was justified in issuing rule, we do not find any justification for staying further proceedings pursuant to the action which had been initiated by the customs authorities. The latter part of the impugned order dated 21st May, 1999 staying further proceedings is accordingly set aside.
3. No stay shall be granted by the High Court in respect thereto pending disposal of the writ petition before it. We make it clear that we are not expressing any opinion on the merits of the case.
The appeal is accordingly, disposed of. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
