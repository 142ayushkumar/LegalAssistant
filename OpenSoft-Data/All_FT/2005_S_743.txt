Avaneet and others v State of Uttar Pradesh and others
Supreme Court of India

21 February 2005
S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 167-71 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Permission to file additional documents is granted.
Applications for intervention are allowed.
1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties for a considerable time, we are of the view that the matter requires consideration since, prima facie, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court seem to run counter to the decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Saurabh Chaudri v. Union of India  2003 Indlaw SC 959.
2. The learned counsel, however, contend that the provisions of the State Act, in particular Section 28(5) of the Uttar Pradesh State Universities Act, 1973, will have to be examined and in that light, the question has to be determined whether those who are domicile of the State of Uttar Pradesh but do not belong to the institution are eligible to be considered in the fifty per cent institutional quota seats of postgraduate courses. Clause 3.1.3 in the information brochure issued for the Uttar Pradesh Postgraduate Medical Entrance Examination, 2005, for admission in Session 2005 for MD/MS/MDS postgraduate diploma makes them eligible for the institutional quota seats as well. To that extent, clause 3.1.3, prima facie, is contrary to Saurabh Chaudri
3.  Thus, while granting leave, we stay the operation of the impugned judgment and order of the High Court and the respondent State/University would declare the results keeping in view this order of stay.
Petition allowed.
