Dongargarh Bidi Majdoor Singh and another v State Industrial Court, M. P. Indore and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 July 1990
C.A. Nos. 2946 of 1984 and 3450 of 1990 (Arising out of S.L.P. No. 3968 of 1984)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special Leave No. 3968 of 1984 is granted
1.  These appeals are filed by a Union representing 37 workmen in whose favour an award had been made by the Labour Court, M. P. as early as 1973 directing their reinstatement and payment of full wages during the period they were kept out of service. To this day they have neither been reinstated not have they been paid the amounts due to them. It is true that 25 workmen had been paid wages due to them in the sum of Rs. 74, 330 for the period from 1966 to 1973. For the subsequent period, they have not been paid anything by the management. The other 12 workmen have not been paid anything at all as per the award
2.  Having heard counsel on both sides and after perusing the records, we are convinced that, although the workmen have a legitimate right to approach the concerned authority under Section 33(c) (2) of the Industrial Disputes Act for realisation of the amounts due to them in terms of the award, it would be unjust and unfair to send them to that authority at this distance of time. The award ought to have been in all fairness honoured by the management within a reasonable time
3.  We are, therefore, of the view that it would be fair and proper if the amounts are determined here and now. Accordingly we direct the management to pay to the 25 workers who had already been paid Rs. 74, 330 as aforesaid, a further sum of Rs. 12, 000 each in full and final settlement of all their claims against the management. We further direct that the management shall pay the 12 remaining workers a sum of Rs. 15, 000 each in full and final settlement of all their claims. We make it clear that the workers shall have no right of reinstatement. We direct the management to pay the sums aforesaid within 3 months from today. The appellant-Union shall furnish a list of the concerned workmen to the respondent, and a copy of the same shall be filed in the Registry within one week from today. We make it clear that on payment of the amounts as aforesaid, m all criminal proceedings now pending between the parties shall come to an end. The appeals are disposed of in the above terms.
Appeals disposed of.
