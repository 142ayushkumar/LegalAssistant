CIT v Lovely Exports Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

11 January 2008
Special Leave to Appeal No. 11993 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Delay condoned.
1.  Can the amount of share money be regarded as undisclosed income under s. 68 of IT Act, 1961? We find no merit in this Special Leave Petition for the simple reason that if the share application money is received by the assessee company from alleged bogus shareholders, whose names are given to the AO, then the Department is free to proceed to reopen their individual assessments in accordance with law.
Hence, we find no infirmity with the impugned judgment.
Subject to the above, Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition Dismissed.
