C.A. No. 4413 of 2001 (Arising as an appeal by special leave from the order Dt. 8 February 1999, of the Madras High Court in T.C.P. No. 820 of 1997).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, in our opinion, a question of law does arise, especially in view of the fact that the Madras High Court in CIT v. Balaji Enterprises 1997 Indlaw MAD 267 in a case of the respondent relating to a similar claim for deduction had allowed the application under section 256(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
2.  We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and direct the Tribunal to state the case and refer the following question of law to the High Court :
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in directing the Assessing Officer to allow deduction of service charges amounting to Rs. 1, 82, 03, 470 or any part thereof ?"
Appeal allowed.
