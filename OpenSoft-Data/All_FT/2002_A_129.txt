22 July 2002
C.As. Nos. 6272 to 6275 of 2001. Appeals By Special Leave From the Judgment and Order Dt. 7 June 2001, of the Andhra Pradesh High Court In W.P. Nos. 21145, 22413, 22419 and 22707 of 1998.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In the instant case, the appellant purchases raw hides and skins which are then processed and the tanned or dressed hides and skins are then exported. The appellant contends that it is entitled to the benefit of section 5(3) of the Central Act. This Court in K.A.K. Anwar and Co. v. State of Tamil Nadu 1997 Indlaw SC 17211997 Indlaw SC 1721 has categorically held that dressed hides and skins are different goods from raw hides and skins. Section 5(3) would be applicable where the goods which are sold or purchased have not undergone any transformation.
2. In the instant case what is purchased by the appellant are raw hides and skins and it is not the same goods which are exported. Those raw hides and skins are then processed and it is the dressed hides and skins which are exported. Therefore, section 5(3) will have no application. The appeals are dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
