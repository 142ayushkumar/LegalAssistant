S. B. Mathur, The Resident Commissioner and Another v Matti Ullah
Supreme Court of India

1 November 1993
C.A. No. 6095 of 1993 (Arising out of S.L.P. No. 9596 of 1993)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  We have heard counsel on both sides. We find that the petitioner filed a writ petition in the High Court of Delhi, being Civil Writ Petition No. 694 of 1991, and sought an interim order against the proposed transfer. The High Court merely issued notice but did not grant any interim order. While that petition was pending the petitioner thereafter filed another writ petition in the High Court of J and K without disclosing the fact of pendency of the writ petition in the Delhi High Court. After he got the desired interim order he withdrew his writ petition in the Delhi High Court stating the circumstances in which he filed the petition in the J and K High Court. Even what he has stated in the petition would not justify the suppression of the material fact that his petition in the Delhi High Court was pending and that the said High Court had refused to grant any interim order.
2.   In the above circumstances we stay the impugned order of the J and K High Court and direct the petitioner to move the JandK High Court for orders after bringing these facts to its notice. The High Court may then pass appropriate orders in the JandK High Court. We do hope that the High Court will take up the matter as early as possible. The appeal will stand disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
