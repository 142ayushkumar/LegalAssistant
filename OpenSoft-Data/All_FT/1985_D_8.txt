Delhi Pradesh House Owners Association v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

19 December 1985
W.P. No. 11817 of 1985 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Dr Chitale appearing for the petitioners, with his usual fairness, confines his submissions to the proposed amendment of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. He suggests that the provisions contained in S. 14(1)(d), (e) and (h) of the Act should be so structured as to make the Act more just and reasonable and strike a proper balance between the competing needs of the landlords and tenants.
2.  We are informed that there is a proposed Bill which is likely to be introduced. The government will consider whether the changes suggested by the petitioners are necessary. Some of the proposed changes in the Bill practically put a class of landlords outside the purview of the Act which may not be in the public interest.
3.   We also feel that the Act should contain provisions for regulating the rents in view of the spiral rise of rents in the metropolitan city of Delhi due to a provision like S. 21 of the Act which permits a lease for a limited period. There should also be an effective machinery for an expeditious trial of suits where the landlord is in bona fide need of the demised premises for his own residential use.
4.  Learned Attorney-General who is present agrees to look into the suggestions and advise the government accordingly.
The matter is adjourned for eight weeks.
Order accordingly.
