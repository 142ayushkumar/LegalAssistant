1. The appellant applied for the post of Krishi Sevak in the Department of Agriculture, Government of Maharashtra.
2. The Tribunal, on verification of the records found that the application was under the quota reserved for Ex-Servicemen. The appellant obtained only 46.25% marks. It appears that the appointment was offered to the appellant under the category of 'Scheduled Castes'. The appellant was offered appointment on the basis of application and on the basis of marks secured by him for the 'Ex-Serviceman' category.
3. The appellant took up a contention that his appointment is only under the 'Scheduled Castes' category. If it was in the Scheduled Castes category, the last successful candidate had secured 62.75% marks. Therefore, in any case the appellant was not entitled for appointment.
4. In that view of the matter, we do not find any reason to interfere with the concurrent findings rendered by the Tribunal and the High Court.
5. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.
6. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
7. There shall be no orders as to costs.
Appeal dismissed
