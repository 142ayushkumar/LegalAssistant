Sheela Devi v Mohan Sarup and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 February 1987
C.A. No. 852 of 1973 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 12 September 1972 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in R.S.A. No. 1232 of 1961)
The Judgment was delivered by: V. Balakrishna Eradi, J.
1.  After hearing counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant we do not find any error of law in the view taken by the High Court that the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration to the effect that the sale deed dated May 16,1955, executed by the first defendant in favour of the second defendent in respect of 19 bighas and 6 Biswas of agricultural land will not affect their reversionary rights and that they shall be entitled to the possession of the land in suit on the death of defendant 1 on payment of the sum of Rs. 6,706 to which extent alone legal necessity had been proved.
2.  The said view is not in any way inconsistent with the dictum laid down by the Privy Council in Hanumanprasad Panday v. Mussumat Babooee Munraj Koonweree .
3. The appeal is therefore devoid of merit and it will accordingly stand dismissed. In the circumstances, we direct the parties to bear their respective costs.
Appeal dismissed.
