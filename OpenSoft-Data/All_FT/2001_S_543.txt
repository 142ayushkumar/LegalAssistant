The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard Mr. B B Singh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and have perused the order of the learned Single Judge dated 28th July, 1997 with which the Division Bench agreed on 3rd November, 1998. The Division Bench directed the petitioner to comply with the directions issued in M.J.C. No. 783 of 1996 made pursuant to the order of the writ court in C.W.J.C. No. 2023 of 1993 and to pay to the respondent arrears of dearness relief w.e.f. 1.10.1982 to 28.2.1989.
2. We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned orders. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.
3.  Since, the time granted by the High Court to pay the arrears of dearness allowance has expired, we grant four weeks' time to the petitioner to comply with the directions of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 3.11.1998. The period of four weeks shall commence from the date of receipt or production of a certified copy of this order before the competent authority.
Order accordingly.
