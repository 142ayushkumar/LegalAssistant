Mir Singh and Others v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

21 November 1995
Civil Appeal No. 282 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  In this case, notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition acquiring a large extent of land of 966 bighas was published on October 24, 1961. Ultimately, the High Court granted @ Rs.12/- per sq. yd., i.e., Rs.12,000/- per bigha. The High Court followed the decision in Sanwalia & Ors.vs. Union of India. It is stated by Mr. P.P. Juneja, learned counsel for the appellants, that the notification of the lands covered in the Sanwalia's case is July 13, 1959, they are entitled to higher compensation due to lapse of time. We find it very difficult to accept the contention.
2.  The High Court has awarded the uniform rate to all the lands at Rs.12,000/-per bigha, i.e., Rs.12/- per sq. yd. We do not find any much justification to distinguish the other cases from that ofthe appellants to grant enhanced compensation.
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. No costs.
