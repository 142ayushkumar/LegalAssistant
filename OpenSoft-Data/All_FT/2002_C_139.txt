The Order of the Court was as follows:

The matters went higher and upto the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, which decided in favour of the assessees. In the interregnum, the assessees paid the excise duty under protest. Upon the appeals before the Tribunal being decided in their favour, on 17th January, 1991, the assessees claimed repayment of the amount of duty paid by them under protest.

(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any judgment, decree, order or direction of the Appellate Tribunal or any Court or in any other provision of this Act or the rules made thereunder or any other law for the time being in force, no refund shall be made except as provided in sub-section (2).
Explanation.- For the purposes of this section.....
(B) 'relevant date' means -
(f) in any other case, the date of payment of duty."
3.  On 3rd July, 1993 the assessees were served with notices which asked them to show cause why the amounts of excise duty paid by them under protest should not be retained by the Revenue, having regard to the provisions of Section 11B, as amended. The assessees should cause, but to no avail. This matter also, ultimately, reached the Tribunal and, by the order under challenge, the Tribunal upheld the contention of the Revenue.
4.  Subsequent to this decision of the Tribunal a Bench of nine learned Judges of this Court has resolved the issue in favour of the assessees. The judgment is inMafatlal Industries Limitedv.Union of India 1996 Indlaw SC 1515. reads thus:
"Rule 9B provides for provisional assessment in situations specified in Clauses (a), (b) and (c) of sub-rule (1). The goods provisionally assessed under sub-rule (1) may be cleared for home consumption or export in the same manner as the goods which are finally assessed. Sub-rule (5) provides that 'when the duty leviable on the goods is assessed finally in accordance with the provisions of these Rules, the duty provisionally assessed shall be adjusted against the duty finally assessed, and if the duty provisionally assessed falls short of or in excess of the duty finally assessed, the assessee shall pay the deficiency or be entitled to a refund, as the case may be'. Any recoveries or refunds consequent upon the adjustment under sub-rule (5) of Rule 9B will not be governed by Section 11A or Section 11B, as the case may be."
5.  It is fairly not disputed by learned Counsel for the Revenue that the decision inMafatlal Industries Limitedgoverns the appeals. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed and the order under appeal is set aside. Consequential repayments shall be made within twelve weeks. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
