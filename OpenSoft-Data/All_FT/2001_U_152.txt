Union of India and Others v Messrs Kotak Bros. and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15693-15695/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  In view of the decision of this Court in Union of India and Others vs. Apar Private Ltd. and Others, this appeal has to be allowed. Apart from anything else, it is quite evident from a Press statement made on 6th February, 1987 by the official of the Finance Ministry that duty of 25 per cent on import of pulses had been imposed.
2.  This Press statement is set out in the Financial Express of 7th February, 1987, copy of which has been annexed with the rejoinder affidavit. This clearly lends support to the case of the appellants that by a Gazette Notification the imposition had been effected by them.
3.  We, therefore, allow these appeals and set aside the judgment dated 28th June, 1995 of the High Court. As a result thereof, the writ petitions filed by the respondents stand dismissed.
Appeals allowed.
