2. Brief facts giving rise to this appeal are:
3. The respondent-company imported 16 consignments of LPG onversion kits into India and sought to clear the same from the customs uthorities.
4. A show cause notice bearing No.F.No.VIII/48-7/LPG/ACC/2000 dated 24.10.2000 was issued to the respondent-company stating therein that onversion of a vehicle for facilitating its operation by LPG is prohibited as er Section 52 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 and, therefore, the parts of PG conversion kits under importation appears to be liable for confiscation nder Section 111(d) of the Customs Act, 1962.
5. Respondents submitted their reply to the notice by contesting the otice being without jurisdiction, against the law and requested the customs uthorities for clearance of the consignments.
6. Respondents filed Special Civil Application No. 11407 of 2000 in the igh Court of Gujarat challenging the Notice.
7. By the impugned order, the High Court has allowed the petition and uashed the Notice dated 24.10.2000.
8. Revenue is before us in the present appeal.
9. Heard counsel for the parties.
10. Section 111(d) of the Customs Act, 1962 provides that
"any goods which are imported or attempted to be mported or are brought within the Indian customs waters or the purpose of being imported, contrary to any rohibition imposed by or under this Act or any other law or the time being in force are liable to be confiscated".
11. Section 52, as amended w.e.f. 11.8.2000, provides:
"52. Alteration in motor vehicle--(1) No owner of a motor ehicle shall so alter the vehicle that the particulars ontained in the certificate of registration are at variance ith those originally specified by the manufacturer:
Provided that where the owner of a motor vehicle makes odification of the engine, or any part thereof, of a vehicle or facilitating its operation by different type of fuel or ource of energy including battery, compressed natural as, solar power, liquid petroleum gas or any other fuel or ource of energy, by fitment of a conversion kit, such odification shall be carried out subject to such conditions s may be prescribed:
Provided further that the Central Government may rescribe specifications, conditions for approval, Retrofitment and other related matters for such conversion its:
Provided also that the Central Government may grant xemption for alteration of vehicles in a manner other han specified above, for any specific purpose."
12. A reading of these two sections makes it clear that Section 52 does ot prohibit either the importation of the LPG conversion kits or prohibit the hange in the source of energy from petrol to compressed natural gas or iquid petroleum gas.
13. In view of above, we do not find any error in the impugned order assed by the High Court. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed but without ny order as to costs.
