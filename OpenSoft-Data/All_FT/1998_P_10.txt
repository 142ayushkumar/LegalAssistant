Canara Bank v P. R. N. Upaadhyayaa and Others
Supreme Court of India

15  May  1998
S.L.Ps. (C) No. 11807 of 1997 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 26 February 1997 in CN No. 124 of 1996 of the Banking Ombudsman, Hyderabad) with No. 23684 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It appears that attention of this Court when it decided the case of State Bank of Patiala v. Harbans Singh 1994 Indlaw SC 1941 was not drawn to the second para of circular dated 1-4-1981, referred to in the judgment. The learned counsel for the Banks state that the date of the circular is wrongly mentioned therein as 18-4-1991, and the correct date of that circular is 1-4-1981. In our opinion, the second para of that circular has a substantial bearing on the question involved and therefore, the decision requires reconsideration.
2. We, therefore, direct the Registry to place papers of this case before the Hon. Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders. The learned counsel appearing for the Canara Bank and the Reserve Bank request that the matter may be directed to be listed, as early as possible as a large number of awards have been passed by the Ombudsman and they are creating problems for the Reserve Bank and other banks.
Order accordingly.
