Nand Kishore Soni v U.O.I. and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 December 2001
CIVIL APPEAL No.1807/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the appellant, and on examining the impugned order of the Tribunal, we do not find any infirmity with the same requiring our interference, in as much as the non-appointment of the appellant at an earlier date to the post selected is on account of own laches, as has already been indicated in the order of the Tribunal.
Therefore, we do not find any merit in the appeal.
The Civil Appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
