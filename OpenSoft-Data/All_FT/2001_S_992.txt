State of Orissa and Anr v Pratap Kumar Nayak and Anr
Supreme Court of India

26 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.1474/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
I.As. are dismissed as withdrawn.
1.  SLP(C) Nos.1474 and 5514/2001. The State is in appeal against the impugned order of the High Court. The apprehension of the State Government is that the impugned order per se enables those teachers whose services stood validated under the Validation Act are entitled to the grant-in-aid, notwithstanding the provisions of the grant-in-aid order of 1994 and section 7(c) of the Orissa Education Act, which was brought into the Act by way of an amendment.
2. We see no justification for this grievance on the part of the State inasmuch the High Court has merely directed the State Government to consider the entitlement of these validated teachers in terms of the provisions of the grant-in-aid order and section 7(c) of the Amendment Act. We therefore see no justification to interfere with the impugned direction. The SLPs are dismissed.
3.  SLP(C) No.13846/2001. This petition by the State is against the impugned direction of the learned Single Judge of the High Court. On going through the said order, we are satisfied that the High Court committed error in issuing the direction given. As we have already stated in SLP(C) Nos.1474 and 5514/2001, an employee whose services stood validated by the Validation Order ipso-facto will not be entitled to grant-in-aid unless and until his case is duly considered under the provisions of the grant-in-aid order read with section 7(c) of the Amendment Act.
4.  It would therefore be necessary for the State Government to examine each and every case in accordance with prescribed procedure for such grant-in-aid. The SLP is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
