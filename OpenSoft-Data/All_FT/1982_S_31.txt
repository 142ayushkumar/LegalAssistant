Smt. Uma Seth v State of Himachal Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

1 December 1982
Cr.A. No. 623 of 1982 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 3 May 1982 of the High Court of Himachal Pradesh in Cr.A. No. 14, of 1980).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted limited to the question of sentence only.
We are of the view that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and particularly in view of the fact that the petitioner is a lady and is also not keeping good health as it appears from the medical certificate produced before us, it will meet the ends of justice if the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the appellant is reduced to five years' rigorous imprisonment.
1. We accordingly allow the appeal on the question of sentence and reduce the sentence to five years' rigorous imprisonment. The sentence of fine is maintained.
Appeal allowed.
