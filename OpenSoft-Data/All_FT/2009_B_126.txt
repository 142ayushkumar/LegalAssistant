Bharat M. Shah v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

30 January 2009
I.A. No. 5 in C.A. No. 4234 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Matter to come up for final hearing on 29th July, 2009.
1.  It is made clear that in case appellant succeeds in the Civil Appeal, he will not be liable to pay demurrage for the period commencing from today. This direction is required to be given because in this case the appellant is prepared to pay the redemption fine and clear the goods so that his liability to pay demurrage stops. He has already incurred liability by way of demurrage till today. He seeks clearance of goods which Union of India objects to.
2. Therefore, if the appellant succeeds, the liability will be of Union of India, Assistant Director, DRT/MZU, Mumbai, to pay demurrage from today. It is well settled that in cases where the Court comes to the conclusion that demurrage liability has arisen due to wrongful refusal of the Department to clear the goods the liability would be of Union of India. There is one more reason. We are informed that pending Special Leave Petition, the Department has issued notice to auction.
Till further orders, auction shall remain stayed. We are required to stay the auction because the Department has refused to clear the goods notwithstanding the offer of the petitioner to pay redemption fine and demurrage till date.
Order accordingly.
