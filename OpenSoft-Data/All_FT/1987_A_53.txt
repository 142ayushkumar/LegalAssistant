Secretary, Medical Council of India v Arun H. Bakle and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 January 1987
C.A. No. 209 of 1986
"The Order of the Court is as follows"
The High Court has recorded :
"It is not in dispute that the petitioner is a citizen of India and that he has undergone practical training after obtaining the qualification as prescribed by Rules and the Regulations in force in country granting the qualification that is in USSR".
1. The respondent is, therefore, fully covered by S. 13(3) of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 which provides that a person possessing the medical qualifications granted by medical institutions outside India, which are included in Part II of the third schedule shall be recognised medical qualification for the purposes of the Act but that no person possessing any such qualification shall be entitled to enrollment on any State Medical Register unless he is a citizen of India and has undergone such practical training after obtaining that such qualification as may be required by the Rules and Regulations in force in the country granting the qualification.
It is only where he has not undergone any such training that he has to undergo such practical training as may be prescribed in India. There is, therefore, no merit in the appeal which is accordingly dismissed with costs quantified at Rs. 2500.
Appeal dismissed.
