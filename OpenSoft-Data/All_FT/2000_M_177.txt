The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Pursuant to the order passed by this court on 27th September, 2000, Mr. Harish N. Salve, learned Solicitor General of India today submitted that 25% of the Award amount has been deposited with the Reference Court. In view of the deposit having been made, we permit claimants to withdraw the entire deposited amount provided they furnish security for half of the deposited amount.
2. In other words, claimants can withdraw half of the amount deposited upon furnishing security and the remaining half amount they can withdraw without security if they propose to withdraw it. Execution of the decree would stand stayed till the disposal of the appeals pending before the High Court.
3.  We modify the impugned order to the above extent. Now the High Court will dispose of the appeals as expeditiously as possible. With these observations all these appeals are disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
