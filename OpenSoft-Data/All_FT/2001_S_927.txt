State of Maharashtra and Anr v Manish N. Choudhari and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 July 2001
Civil Appeal No. 2703 of 2000
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  Certain rules have been framed for admission to 1st year Engineering & Technology Course 1998-99. Rule 6.6 read with Rule 15 which came in the way of the respondents and certain other students seeking transfer from one Engineering college to another, challenged these Rules to be illegal.
2. The High Court made an interim order against which SLP is preferred before this Court.
3.  This Court while granting leave stayed the impugned order inasmuch as the period for which the Rules were in force has already lapsed. As the purpose of the petition is lost, we find no useful purpose will be served in pursuing with the matter. The appeal stands disposed off as having been infructuous.
Appeal Disposed of.
