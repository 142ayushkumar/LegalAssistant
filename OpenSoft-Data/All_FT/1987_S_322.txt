Supreme Court of India

6 March 1987
Cr.A. No. 327 of 1978
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We heard Shri. U. R. Lalit learned counsel for the appellant and have gone through the judgment of the High Court as well as the testimony of PW 1 Smt. Powan. The conviction of the appellant rests on the testimony of the prosecutrix PW 1 Smt. Powan which stands corroborated in material particulars by evidence of an independent character namely that of her husband PW 4 Ganesh. Their evidence shows that at about midnight the appellant who claims to be a trade union worker had clandestinely effect entry into the verandah of the school building where the laborers employed in a coal mine were asleep and was caught red handed while in the act of committing sexual intercourse with PW 1 Smt. Powan. PW 1 was sleeping near her husband and on finding a stranger she raised an alarm. The appellant tried to run away but was caught by the prosecutrix by the scruff of his neck and given a thrashing by her husband PW 4 Ganesh and the other labourers and thereafter he was handed over to the Security Inspector of the Colliery. The High Court as well as the 3rd Extra Assistant Sessions Judge having given very witnesses. We find no ground for interference and also no reason to take a different view.
2.  The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed. Bail bond of the appellant shall stand canceled and he shall surrender forthwith to serve and the remaining part of the sentence.
Appeal Dismissed.
