Naresh Kumar Garg and Others v Ghaziabad Development Authority and Anr
Supreme Court of India

13 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8226/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  Learned senior counsel for the petitioners apprehend that their stand that appeal is not maintainable cannot now be raised again because of the preliminary finding of the High Court that the appeal cannot be thrown out over board as pleaded by them.
2. We do not think that what is now mentioned in the impugned order will stand in the way of the petitioners to raise the contentions at the final stage of argument. In view of this we are inclined to entertain this SLP. It is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
