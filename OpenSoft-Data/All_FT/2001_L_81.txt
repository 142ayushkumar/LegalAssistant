Arab Salabhai Mohmadbhai (D) By Lr. and Others v Luhar Narottam Keshavji (D) By Lrs. and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20518/2000
The order of the Court was as follows:
Substitution allowed.
We are not inclined to interfere with the matter.
1.  The Special Leave Petition is dismissed. After we dismissed the matter, learned counsel for the petitioners stated that in case the petitioners are required to vacate the premises immediately, it shall create great hardship to them. Therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is justified.
2. We, therefore, grant time upto 30.9.2001 to the petitioners to vacate the premises on their filing usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from today. In case the respondents have any objection to this part of the order, it shall be open to them to apply for vacation of this order.
Petition dismissed.
