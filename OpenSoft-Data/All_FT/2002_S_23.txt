Sabra Shamim v Maqsood Ansari
Supreme Court of India

23 August 2002
Cr.A. No. 856 of 2002 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 7094 of 2001)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court proceeded on a premise that the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 provides that a divorced wife will be entitled to maintenance till the iddat period only and not any further and on that basis set aside the order made by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Dhanbad in Misc. Case No. 40 of 1991 (arising out of M.P. Case No. 19 of 1982). This proposition of law on which the High Court proceeded is plainly contrary to the decision of this Court in Danial Latifi v. Union of India 2001 Indlaw SC 20886.
2.  Therefore, the order made by the High Court is set aside and the order made by the Family Court stands restored. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
