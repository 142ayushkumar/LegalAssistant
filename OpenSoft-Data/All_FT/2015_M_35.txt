1. Leave granted.
2. Upon perusal of the impugned judgment, we find that the examination of the witnesses was objected. Ultimately the production of the documents was also objected and the High Court set aside the sale.
3. In our opinion, at this juncture, the High Court should not have objected to the examination of witnesses and production of documents.
4. Needless to say that it would be open to the parties to raise all contentions available to them at law and produce documents, which should have been produced before the trial court.
5. In the circumstances we set aside the impugned order and the interim relief granted by this Court is vacated.
6. The learned counsel appearing for the parties desire that the trial court be requested to conclude the trial at an early date.
7. We are sure that the learned counsel appearing for the parties before the trial court shall extend their cooperation to the trial court. The trial court shall proceed with the trial and conclude it as soon as possible.
8. The parties are directed to appear before the trial court on 2nd November, 2015. Intimation of this order be forwarded to the trial court forthwith.
9. The appeal is disposed of as allowed with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of
