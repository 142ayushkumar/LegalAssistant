Siri Ram v State of Haryana and Another
Supreme Court of India

22 March 1995
C.A. No. ... of 1989
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  This appeal by special leave is directed against the impugned judgment dated 19-5-1988 and the subsequent order dated 1-11-1988 passed in Regular First Appeal No. 318 of 1985 and Civil Miscellaneous No. 938 of 1988 respectively by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. So far as the main judgment is concerned Mr. Bhagat states that he does not press his appeal against that judgment. Therefore, the appeal insofar as the main judgment of 19-5-1988 is concerned, will stand disposed of with no order as to costs as not pressed. Mr. Bhagat is, however, right when he contends that his case falls within the ratio of this Court's decision in Scheduled Caste Coop. Land Owning Society Ltd. v. Union of India 1990 Indlaw SC 448 which came to be affirmed and approved by the Constitution Bench by its order in Buta Singh v. Union of India  1995 Indlaw SC 1555.
2.   We, therefore, set aside the order passed in Civil Miscellaneous No. 938 of 1988 dated 1-11-1988 and direct that the High Court should dispose of the case by permitting the appellant to pay the deficit court fee within one month from today in accordance with the observations made by this Court in the aforesaid decision. The appeal will, therefore, stand allowed insofar as it relates to the order passed in Civil Micellaneous No. 938 of 1988 dated 1-11-1988 with no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
