Y. S. Narayana v Karnataka Electricity Board and Another
Supreme Court of India

1 February 1989
C.A. No. 542 of 1989 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 15193 of 1987)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  We have received the report of Tehsildar of Hoskote Taluk of Bangalore District (Karnataka) submitted to this Court pursuant to the order dated August 19, 1988. The Tehsildar states that on inquiry he found that the appellant Y. S. Narayana is a person belonging to backward class. It is admitted that the Selection Committee appointed by the Electricity Board has not considered the case of the appellant for appointment as Junior Engineer on the basis that he belongs to the backward class, and he was found to be not entitled to be appointed as Junior Engineer when his case was considered as a candidate belonging to the general category. Having regard to the fact that the appellant belongs to the backward class we feel that it is just and appropriate that we should direct the Selection Committee of Karnataka Electricity Board to consider the case of the appellant for appointment as a candidate belonging to the backward class category.
2.   We accordingly issue a direction to the Karnataka Electricity Board to place the case of the appellant before the Selection Committee for considering whether he is entitled to be appointed to the post of Junior Engineer for which he had made the application on the basis that he belongs to the backward class and to appoint him as a Junior Engineer, if he is found fit. This order shall be complied with within two months from the date of the receipt of the copy of this order.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
