Prabhakaran Nair and Another v Gopalan and Others
Supreme Court of India

18 September 1991
C.A. No. 46 of 1978
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned counsel. We have also gone through the judgment under appeal as also the other connected papers.
2.  The view of the High Court appears to us right in the circumstances that Section 6-B of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, comes to the rescue of the respondents seeking relief under Section 13-A of the said Act.
3.  Pulling these two provisions apart would render the legislative amendments nugatory. The High Court rightly avoided such construction. Finding no merit thus in this appeal, we dismiss the same. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
