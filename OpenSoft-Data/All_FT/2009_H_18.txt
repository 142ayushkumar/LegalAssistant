Additional Commissioner of Income-tax, New Delhi v HCL Technologies Limited
Supreme Court of India

17 August 2009
CC No. 10920 of 2009
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Heard both sides.
1.  We are of the view that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, particularly when the High Court has remitted the matter to the Transfer Pricing Officer from whose Order an appeal is pending before the CIT(A), it would be in the interest of both sides to resort to Alternate Dispute Resolution Mechanism suggested in the Budget of 2009 ( section 144C of the Income-tax Act, 1961).
2. It is made clear that the Competent Authority will not reject the Application herein made by the assessee on the ground that the proposal has come after the cut-off date. The learned Additional Solicitor General will, accordingly, communicate instructions to the Department. The Competent Authority will decide the matter notwithstanding the pendency of the Appeal before the CIT.
Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
