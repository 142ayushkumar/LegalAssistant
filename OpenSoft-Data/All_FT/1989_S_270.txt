Munna and another v State of Uttar Pradesh and another
Supreme Court of India

15 March 1989
W.P. (Criminal) Nos. 6 of 1982 and 8974 and 9133 of 1981 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner is not present today and so too on the last occasion when it was directed that he be informed. But the office report shows that the notice sent to the petitioner could not be served as he has left and no address is available.
2.  We have perused the material on record and also the orders made by this Court from time to time. We have also perused the judgment of the Allahabad High Court dated February 12, 1982 where similar grievance has been considered.
3.  This matter is pending for the past six years. It is unnecessary to keep the matter on the record further. This Court by order dated January 29, 1982 has impressed upon the Magistrates in the State of Uttar Pradesh and to the Magistrates in the other parts of the country where the Children Acts are in force, that they must be extremely careful to see that no person apparently under the age of 16 years is sent to jail, but he must be detained in a Children's Home or other place of safety. 
We do not think any more need be done in this case.
The writ petitions are, therefore, disposed for accordingly.
Petitions disposed of.
