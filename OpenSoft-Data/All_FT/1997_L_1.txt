Supreme Court of India

31 January 1997
C.A. No. 596 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 24374 of 1995)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal is against the High Court's order rejecting the application made under Section 256(2) of the Income Tax Act 
 to call for a reference on the following question of law, namely,
"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the ITAT was right in law in upholding the order of the CIT (A) directing the ITO to exclude the capital gains an sing from the transfer of agricultural lands from the assessment ?"
2.  The High Court rejected the application in view of the decisions in Manubhai A. Sheth v. ND Nirgudkar 1980 Indlaw MUM 3917 and J. Raghottama Reddy v. ITO 1987 Indlaw AP 200.
3. However, an explanation has been inserted in sub-section (1-A) of Section 2 of the Income Tax Act 
by the Finance Act, 1989 with retrospective effect from 1-4-1970 to overcome the effect of those decisions. This being so, the aforesaid question of law does arise out of the Tribunal's order.
4.  Consequently, the appeal is allowed with the result that the application made under Section 256(2) of the Act for reference of the above question of law is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
