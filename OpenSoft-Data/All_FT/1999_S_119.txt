Sevak Ayat Niryat Company v Oriental Insurance Company Limited
Supreme Court of India

12 October 1999
C.A. No. 2550 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 10-1-1996 passed by the National Commission. The main ground urged before us is that the notice of hearing of the appeal was not served to the counsel for the appellant-complainant and consequently he could not put in an appearance before the National Commission. The judgment passed by the National Commission also indicates that nobody was present on behalf of the complainant. This fact is not disputed on behalf of the respondent.
2. Consequently, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment passed by the National Commission is set aside and the case is remanded to it to decide it afresh after giving an opportunity of hearing to the appellant. The Commission is requested to dispose of the claim petition at an early date.
Appeal allowed.
