Collector Of Central Excise, Madurai v TVS Srichakra Limited and another
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2002
C.As. Nos. 5862-63 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, on the facts of this case, we are of the opinion that the stand of the respondents is correct.
2. Various calculations have been made and we have taken into consideration the subsequent price which has been approved by the Department with effect from 8-10-1992 and it clearly appears to us that the revision of the price was cum-duty and, therefore, the element of duty in the increased amount had to be deducted.
3. The appeals are dismissed. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
