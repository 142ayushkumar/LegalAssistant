1.  The boy who was the centre of controversy in the present suit has now attained majority and has expressed his desire to live with Mr R.N. Joshi. The fact however remains that he has been brought up by the defendants.
2.  In view of the changed circumstances and the subsequent events and the boy attaining majority and expressing his desire and his absolute freedom to choose to live wherever he likes, we suggested to the plaintiffs that it will not be worthwhile pursuing the suit as it would not be conducive to the good relationship of the parties.
The appellants agreed and the defendants have also appreciated this gesture. In view of these circumstances, plaintiffs do not want to invite a decision and seek to withdraw the suit.
3.  The suit is permitted to be withdrawn with no order as to costs. We hope the parties will live amicably.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
