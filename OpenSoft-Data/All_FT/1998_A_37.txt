Supreme Court of India

25 September 1998
Contempt Petitions No. D16199 of 1995 with Nos. D17021 and D17022 of 1995
The Judgment was delivered by: DR. A. S. ANAND, J.
1.  We have perused each one of these contempt petitions. Apart from the fact that the petitioner has used intemperate and abusive language in the memorandum of the petitions, which by itself may invite action against the petitioner himself, all the petitions are wholly misconceived. The petitions are accordingly dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
