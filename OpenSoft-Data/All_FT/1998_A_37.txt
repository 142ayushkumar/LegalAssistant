1.  We have perused each one of these contempt petitions. Apart from the fact that the petitioner has used intemperate and abusive language in the memorandum of the petitions, which by itself may invite action against the petitioner himself, all the petitions are wholly misconceived. The petitions are accordingly dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
