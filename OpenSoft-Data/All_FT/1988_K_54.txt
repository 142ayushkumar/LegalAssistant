Kishan Lal Kalal v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 February 1988
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 1459 of 1987 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 21 August 1986 of the High Court of Patna in C.W.J.C.No. 1389/86)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. It appears that notification was issued on July 1, 1981 and because of this notification, the petitioner would have been given the benefit of retrospective promotion from the date on which he was found fit for promotion. But it appears, unfortunately his date of superannuation was June 30, 1981 and it is only because of this reason, he could not get the advantage of the notification issued on July 1, 1981. Those whose date of superannuation fell after July 1, 1981 had been admittedly given advantage of this notification and have been given benefit of retrospective promotion.
2.   It appears, therefore, that as the petitioner's date of superannuation fell on June 30, 1981, he could not be given advantage of the notification, which has been given to other officers similarly situated. It also appears that the notification was issued after some delay
3.  Looking at all these circumstances, in our opinion, the petitioner is entitled to the advantage of the notification, which was issued on July 1, 1981 and he may be given advantage accordingly
Parties are directed to bear their own costs
With these observations, the special leave petition is disposed of
Petition disposed of.
