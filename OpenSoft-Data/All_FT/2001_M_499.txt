15 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3718/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard.
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioners invited attention of the Court to the Order dated 6th January, 1993, Annexure-P7 which permitted the petitioners to dismantle the amalgamated structure and bring it to its original units which were five censused huts, and removing the mezzanine floor. Aggrieved by this order,
2.  The petitioners filed a civil suit wherein, by Order dated 19th March, 1997, Bombay City Civil Court referred the matter back to the Deputy Municipal Commissioner so as to consider certain circulars and policy decisions of the Corporation and suitably modify the order after considering if the benefit of such circulars and policy decisions was available with the petitioners.
3. The petitioners were heard. Vide Order dated 8th November, 1999, Annexure-P11 the Joint Municipal Commissioner/Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Zone-VI) found that the circulars were not applicable to the disputed structures and therefore, the petitioners were directed to demolish the same.
4.  Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners can restore the original structures by carrying out partial demolition and alterations and it may not be necessary to demolish the entire structure.
5.  If that be so, let them make a representation within three weeks from today to the Municipal Corporation, which if so made, may be disposed of by the competent Authority within four weeks thereafter, in accordance with law and after hearing the petitioners.
List after eight weeks.
Order accordingly.
