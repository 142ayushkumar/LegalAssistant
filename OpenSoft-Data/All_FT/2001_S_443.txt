The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. After addressing arguments for some time Mr. R.K.
2. Jain, learned senior counsel requested for an opportunity for the petitioners to raise their contentions before the trial court. The said permission is sought, lest, the observations made by the High Court may stand in the way of the Metropolitan Magistrate countenancing such contention.

If she makes any such application after making her first appearance for bail she shall be exempted from personally appearing in the court on the following conditions:

2. that a counsel on her behalf will appear for her in the court when the case is taken up; and
3. she herself will be present in the court when her presence is imperatively needed;
4. With these observations SLPs are disposed of."
