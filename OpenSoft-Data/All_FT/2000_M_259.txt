Mohan Kumar Lal v Vinoba Bhave University and Others
Supreme Court of India

31 July 2000
C.A. No. 4293 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The short question that arises for consideration in this appeal is whether the Service Commission could ignore the decision to make reservation policy applicable in respect of an appointment to the post, which was advertised on 10-1-1990, and the last date for submission of the application was 30-1-1990.
2. The High Court in the impugned judgment is of the view that since appointments had not factually been made, the reservation policy would apply. As it transpires, the provisions of Section 57, which governs the field, did not contain any clause for reservation and sub-section (5) of the said Section 57 providing for reservation was introduced only on 22-8-1993.
3.  In this view of the matter in respect of the post advertised for which the process of recruitment had been initiated, the reservation policy could not have been made applicable. The impugned judgment of the High Court was therefore erroneous and cannot be sustained.
4.  We therefore, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and hold that the reservation policy, pursuant to the amended provision of sub-section (5) of Section 57 of the Act, will not apply to the present case.The appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
