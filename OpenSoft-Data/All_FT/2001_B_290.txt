Byomkesh Pramanik v Bhabani Prasad Banerjee
Supreme Court of India

7 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20902/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
We find no merit in this petition. It is accordingly dismissed.
1.  It was then urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises in dispute immediately, he will be put to great hardship. He, therefore, seeks some time to vacate the premises. Learned counsel for the caveator has no objection.
2. We, therefore, direct that the petitioner shall not be evicted from the premises till 30th June, 2002, provided he files usual undertaking within a period of four weeks from today, failing which this part of our order shall stand vacated without reference to the Court.
Petition dismissed.
