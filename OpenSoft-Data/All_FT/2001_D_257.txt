Reena Srivastava v Dy. Director of Education-Ii and Others
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15492/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay is condoned.
1.  Though we are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the High Court, yet the fact remains that the petitioner had the protection of the interim order of the High Court which was passed on 13.7.95 and she worked during that period till 2.2.96 when the concerned authority decided the claim of the petitioner.
2. In as much as this fact was not adverted to in deciding her claim to salary, we are of the view that she is entitled to her salary for the said period.
3.  The authority may deduct the amount of the salary for the said period from the grant-in-aid admissible to the Institution and pay the same to the petitioner.
Subject to the above observations, the Special leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
