Savani Transport Private Limited v L.Rajamanikkam
Supreme Court of India

13 January 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows :
As on today, the position has drastically changed because the landlord who obtained an order of eviction on the ground of bona fide need has sold away the property in favour of V. Mani of T.V. Swamy Road (West), R.S. Puram, Coimbatore who is now before us as respondent. Therefore, the need of the original landlord (Rajamanikkam) could no longer be sustained.
1. Accordingly, the appeal will stand allowed. However, there shall be no order as to costs.
