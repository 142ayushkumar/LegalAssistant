1.  We have perused the judgment of the trial court which acquitted all the 21 accused arraigned before it including the seven appellants, as also that of the High Court sentencing each of the appellants to imprisonment for life for an offence u/s. 302 read with S. 149 of the Indian Penal Code alleged to have been committed during the course of an occurrence as a result of which one Bhanwar Singh of village Banbani and his three sons lost their lives.
2.  We have also been taken through the relevant portions of the evidence by learned counsel for the appellants whom we have heard at length in support of the appeal. After giving the case our serious considerations, we are of the opinion that the impugned judgment calls for no interference inasmuch as we find ourselves in full agreement with the conclusions arrived at by the High Court as also with the reasons put forward by it in support thereof and adopt the same.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
