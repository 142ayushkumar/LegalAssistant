Suresh Kumar Tekriwal v State of Jharkhand and another
Supreme Court of India

3 February 2005
S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 669 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. So far as the contention of the petitioner in regard to his right to lead evidence in defence even at the stage of framing charge is concerned, the same is concluded against the petitioner by the judgment of this Court in the case of Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindal 2004 Indlaw SC 666. However, learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the judgment of this Court in State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi 2004 Indlaw SC 1025 wherein this Court said as follows:
" Regarding the argument of the accused having to face the trial despite being in a position to produce material of unimpeachable character of sterling quality, the width of the powers of the High Court u/s. 482 of the Code and Art. 226 of the Constitution is unlimited whereunder in the interests of justice the High Court can make such orders as may be necessary to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice within the parameters laid down in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal,  1990 Indlaw SC 91."
3. Based on the above it is argued that it is open to the petitioner to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution or u/s. 482 CrPC to challenge the complaint filed by the respondent.
4. Learned counsel for the respondent, however, contends that even this is not open to the petitioner because of the fact that there is no proceeding as yet initiated against the petitioner herein. We express no opinion on this. If the petitioner desires to file any such petition as stated above we cannot preclude him from doing so.
5. With the above observation, the special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
