M. B. Patil v K. V. Patil (Dead) By Lrs
Supreme Court of India

9 January 1987
C.A. No. 2004 of 1977 with S.L.P. (Civil) No. 9347 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question involved in this case is whether a Watandar is also a 'holder of village office' within the meaning of the definition of that expression in Mysore Village Officers Abolition Act, 1961. The Karnataka High Court has held that he is a holder of village office within the meaning of the definition and we see no reason to depart from the view taken by the Karnataka High Court. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
No costs.
The special leave petition is permitted to be withdrawn.
Appeal dismissed.
