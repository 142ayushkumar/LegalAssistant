Cambata Aviation Ltd. v State of Maharashtra and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Upon hearing the submissions made on behalf of the parties, we do feel it expedient that the impugned order cannot be sustained in any way. We, however, do not wish to give any comment thereon since we propose to have the matter disposed of by the appropriate Industrial Court.
2. In that view of the matter, State is directed to refer the dispute to the appropriate Industrial Court within a period of 10 weeks from the date hereof. The special leave petition stands disposed of at the admission stage itself with the aforesaid observations. Let the matter, however, be dealt with by the concerned Court appropriately upon affording an opportunity to the parties with utmost expedition and preferably within a period of eight months from the date of issuance of the notification.
Petition disposed of.
