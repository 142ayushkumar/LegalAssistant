Narayan Singh v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

10 March 2004
Cr.A. No. 922 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the parties.
1.  The sole appellant was convicted by the trial court under Section 376 of the Penal Code and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay fine of Rs. 2,000/-; in default, to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of six months. On appeal being preferred the High Court of Madhya Pradesh upheld the conviction. Hence this appeal by special leave.
We find that the High Court has confirmed the sentence after threadbare discussion of evidence and no infirmity could be pointed out in the judgment rendered by the High Court so as to interfere with the same in exercise of powers of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
2.  Bail bonds of the appellant, who is on bail, are cancelled and he is directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence.
Appeal dismissed.
