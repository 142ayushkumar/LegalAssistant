Land Acqusition Officer v Raja Subramanyam (Dead) By LRs. and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7885-7888/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In a land acquisition matter, the Reference Court enhanced the value of the land from Rs.8,000/- per acre to Rs.22,500/-per acre. When the land-owner filed an appeal before the High Court, a Division Bench of the High Court made a leap to Rs.75,000/- per acre. No reason is given for making such a leap, except saying that
"In our view, the claimants are entitled for a little more compensation than what the Court below awarded at least at Rs.75,000/- per acre if not at Rs.1,50,000/- per acre as claimed by them in view of the nature of the land and its potentiality."
2. We, therefore, set aside the impugned judgment and remit the appeals back to the High Court for disposal afresh, in accordance with law.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
