On reference, the Additional District Judge by his award and decree dated 19-12-1973 enhanced the compensation @ Rs 5000 per bigha. The High Court on appeal while enhancing the compensation to Rs 12, 000 per bigha has given the benefits of Amendment Act 68 of 1984 by enhancing the solatium and interest and additional amount.
