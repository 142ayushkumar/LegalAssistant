Lizzie Jacob and Others v E.P. Surenderan and Others
Supreme Court of India

16 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)........../2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  The operative part of the impugned order passed by the High Court, in our view, fully protects the rights of the petitioners, if any.
It reads thus:
"This will not prevent the respondents from taking any steps under the Ordinance for vesting the same on the ground that they are ecologically fragile lands. If these properties are not returned to the petitioners within two weeks from today, the respondents will appear before this Court on 19.9.2000 for further action in this matter.
Further we make it clear that if the lands are restored to the petitioners as stated above, the petitioners shall not alter the nature of the land, cut any trees or change any nature of the land without further permission of this Court."
2.In this view of the matter, these petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
