Nambiram Veetil Pocker v State of Kerala and Another
Supreme Court of India

19 August 2002
Cr.As. No. 852 of 2002 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 2030 of 2002)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  It appears that the appellant has already entered into a compromise with the complainant and the complainant appearing through the learned advocate states, on instructions, that the entire money has been received and he has no objection if the conviction recorded stands set aside.
2.  We are, however, not impressed with the submissions that Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 be treated as compoundable offence, though, however, we feel it expedient to record that since the parties have amicably resolved the dispute and payment has already been made, sentence already undergone would be sufficient punishment for the offender.
3. As such, the sentence is reduced to the period already undergone by the appellant.
4.  The appeal stands disposed of accordingly. His bail bonds shall stand discharged.
Appeal disposed of.
