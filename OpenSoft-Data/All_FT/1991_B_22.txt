Bal Ram and Others v State of Madhya Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

29 October 1991
W.P. Nos. 927-928 of 1987 with W.P. Nos. 1185, 1479-82, 1337-45, 483 of 1987, 1120 of 1987, 1469 of 1986 and 1692-95 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The District Magistrate, Additional District Magistrate and concerned Sub-Divisional Officer are present in Court. They are given two months' time to explore and work out, if accepted, the formation of a reasonable number of co-operative societies in respect of some 4000 bonded labourers, now freed, as a step in aid for their rehabilitation. We have suggested to the Additional District Magistrate, who would be more in charge of the scheme than the District Magistrate on account of his other business, that immediate steps be taken to form the co-operative societies, allocate the land, locate the homestead for raising new residential accommodation nearabout the land to be allotted so that the rehabilitated persons would have a sense of satisfaction.
2.   The petitions are directed to be re-listed on December 20, 1991 when the Additional District Magistrate has undertaken to be personally present to brief the counsel and answer questions of the Court. The matters may be listed before a bench of which Mr Justice Kuldip Singh is a member.
3.  Notice of contempt is discharged. It is open to the Additional District Magistrate to take assistance of the Commissioners who had been appointed by this Court in this activity as indicated in our order.
Order accordingly.
