1.  The applicants herein seek renewal of their mining leases for extraction of iron ore in the State of Goa. The mining area is close to Bhagvan Mahavir Wild Life Sanctuary. It is stated that the area under the lease is only at a distance of about 550 metres, from the said sanctuary.
2. The Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife looked into the matter and it has submitted its report. The matter has to be further considered by the Forest Advisory Committee. The applicants claim that the general rule that any non-forest activity must not be allowed within a distance of 1 km, from the sanctuary/forest area may not be rigidly applied so far as the State of Goa is concerned and in that State the projects should be examined on site-specific basis.
