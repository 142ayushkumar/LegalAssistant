Supreme Court of India

6 February 1989
W.P. No. 1333 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr. R. K. Garg appearing for the petitioner confines his submission to only one aspect relating to implementation of land reforms on Andhra Pradesh State by saying that the State Government of Andhra Pradesh has not, keeping the judgment of this Court reported in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Mohd. Ashrafuddin has not worked out the reforms scheme. Mr. P. A. Choudhary points out that the State of Andhra Pradesh has implemented the land reforms scheme with all promptitude but on account of the fact that the matter relating to one question is pending in this Court and has been referred to the Constitution Bench, implementation has become difficult.
2.   It is pointed out to us that the matters which have been referred to the Constitution Bench have already been included in the list for final disposal. Leave is granted to the council for the parties to mention before the Constitution Bench for early hearing of the matters.
3.  We do not think at this stage it would be appropriate to vacate the orders of stay and direct the Andhra Pradesh Government to enforce the land Reforms Scheme in regard to this aspects as in the event of the Constitution Bench taking a contrary view, the matter will have to be reopened.
Therefore, we would like the present position to continue until the Constitution Bench disposes of the matter. This writ petition be listed after disposal of C. A. No. 3388 of 1984.
Order accordingly.
