State of Uttar Pradesh and Others v Chaudhary Multan Singh
Supreme Court of India

12 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16633/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
In our view this petition would not survive because
(a) at present the respondent - Dental College, Tundla is not at all functioning as stated by learned counsel for the petitioner,
(b) by our order dated 23rd April, 2001, we had stayed the operation of the impugned order; and
(c) Dental Council of India has by order dated 19th June, 2000 refused to allot students to the said College.
1.    However, we make it clear that the following observations made by the High Court are against the statutory provisions, namely, Dentists Act, 1948 and the Regulations framed there under and are not required to be given any effect:
"We are of the view that as the petitioner was given permission by the Central Government to start the courses for the year 1998-99, the Central Government ought to have allowed the institution to continue with the permission once granted by the Central Government, according to the Section 10A(4) of the Dentists Act, 1948 and it would be a sufficient compliance in view of the Section 1CA(5) of the Dentists Act as well."
2.    We also make it clear that further directions given by the High Court to the Chancellor for grant of affiliation would also not survive.
With these directions petition stands disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
