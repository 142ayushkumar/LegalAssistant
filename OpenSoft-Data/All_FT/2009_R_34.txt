4.  The respondent after serving statutory notice on the petitioner filed complaint in the Court of Learned Judicial Magistrate, Karur under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act.
5.  The Trial Court by Judgment dated September 21, 2004 convicted the petitioner under Section 138 and sentenced him to Simple Imprisonment for one year and fine of Rs.5000/- in default Simple Imprisonment for 3 months. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner preferred Criminal Appeal No.107 of 2004 before Sessions Court which was dismissed on 24.12.2004. Thereupon, the petitioner filed Criminal Revision Application No.179 of 2005 before the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court which was dismissed on January 30, 2008. Therefore, the petitioner filed SLP (Crl) No.6974 of 2008 @ CRL.M.P. No.14586 of 2008 which was also dismissed on September 11, 2008.
6. Thereafter a compromise was entered into and petitioner claims that he has paid Rs.4,52,289/- to respondent. In support of this claim, the petitioner has produced affidavit sworn by him on December 1, 2008. The petitioner has also produced affidavit sworn by P.Kaliappan, Power of Attorney holder of R.Rajathi on December 1, 2008 mentioning that he has received a sum of Rs.4,52,289/- due under the dishonoured cheques in full discharge of the value of cheques and he is not willing to prosecute the petitioner.
7. The Learned Counsel for the petitioner states at the bar that the petitioner was arrested on July 30, 2008 and has undergone the sentence imposed on him by the Trial Court and confirmed by Sessions Court, High Court as well as by this Court. The two affidavits sought to be produced by petitioner as additional documents would indicate that indeed a compromise has taken place between petitioner and the respondent and the respondent has accepted the compromise offered by petitioner pursuant to which he has received a sum of Rs.4,52,289/-. In the affidavit filed by the respondent a prayer is made to permit the petitioner to compound the offence and close the proceedings.
8.  Having regard to the salutary provisions of Section 147 of Negotiable Instruments Act read with Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this Court is of the opinion that in view of the compromise arrived at between the parties, the petitioner should be permitted to compound the offence committed by him under Section 138 of the Code.
