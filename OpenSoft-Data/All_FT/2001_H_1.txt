A.R. Engineering Works v H and K Rolling Mills Engineering P. Limited and
Supreme Court of India

11  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7926/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Exemption allowed.
Issue notice. Mr. E.C. Agrawala accepts notice.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The appeal was filed before a Division Bench against an ad-interim ex-parte order which was granted by the Single Judge.
2. In our opinion, rather than entertaining the appeal it would have been more appropriate for the Division Bench to have requested the Single Judge to dispose of the application under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act within a specific period.
3.  Without going into the merits of the decision of the Division Bench, we set aside the same and we direct that the case which is now listed before the Single Judge on 31st August, 2001 shall be placed as item No. 1 in the cause list on that day and the learned Judge will endeavour to finally hear and dispose of the matter.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Petition disposed of.
