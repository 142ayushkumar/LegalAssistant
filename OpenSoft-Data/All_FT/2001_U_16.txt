U.O.I v Raja Upinder Krishan Kaul and Another
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2001
IAs 2-4 in C.A. No.3843/1999
The order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  It appears from the documents on record that in Civil Revision No.3/1992 filed by the petitioner the L.Rs. of the respondent were brought on record by order of the High Court on 31.12.1991.
2. In view of this fact the question of condonation of delay of 3237 days in bringing on record the L.Rs. of deceased respondent no.1 does not arise. There is no justifiable reason much less a sufficient cause to warrant condonation of delay. I.A. No.4 is dismissed. In view of the dismissal of I.A.4, I.A.No.3 is also dismissed.
I.A.No.2 may be listed along with the appeal.
Applications dismissed.
