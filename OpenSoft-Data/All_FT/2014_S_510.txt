1. We may point out that when the matter camp up for hearing on 03.12.2013, we were not inclined to disturb the admissions made in favour of the respondents, and passed an order on the said date directing the State of West Bengal to ascertain whether the seats are available so that the petitioners could be accommodated in the subject of their choice, without disturbing the admissions already made to the respondents.
2. We are informed by the State counsel that it would not be possible to accommodate the petitioners, especially, in the subject of their choice, without disturbing the admissions already made to the respondents.
In such circumstances, we find no reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. The Special Leave Petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed
