Oswal Petrochemicals v Government of Maharashtra and others
Supreme Court of India

20 January 2005
C.As. Nos. 681-82 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 549-50 of 2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard parties.
1.  In view of the judgment of this Court in Cipla Ltd. v. Maharashtra General Kamgar Union 2001 Indlaw SC 20503 the question whether employee-and-employer relationship exists cannot be decided by the Industrial Court. It would necessarily have to be decided in proceedings under Section 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act.
2. We, therefore, grant to the workmen one month's time to raise their dispute. Pending the decision on the reference, the interim order which had been passed on 3-11-1997 will continue to operate. In view of the above order the impugned judgment stands set aside.
3.  At this stage Mr.Manish Singhvi, learned counsel appearing for the appellant applies that the appellant may be allowed to retrench the workers. It is for the Company to decide what steps it wants to take. No liberty is required from us to do so. If they are entitled to do so, they may do so.
4.  The appeals stand disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
