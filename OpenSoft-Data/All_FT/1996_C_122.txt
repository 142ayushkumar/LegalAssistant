Collector of Central Excise, Bombay v Paper Print and Products Company
Supreme Court of India

24 October 1996
C.A. No.2172 of 1988, [Arising as an appeal against 1989 (40) E.L.T. 426 (Tribunal)]
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The short question which we are required to consider in the instant case is whether unwaxed printed paper cut into sheets and reels according to the needs of the customer for the purpose of being used as wrappers in packaging can be said to be a produce of printing industry so as to attract the exemption granted under Notification No.63/82, dated 28-2-1982.
2.  The issue stands squarely covered by the decision of this Court on Rollatainers Ltd. and Anr. v. Union Of India and Others 1994 Indlaw SC 48.
3.  In the said judgment this Court held that the exemption Notification could not apply to material which is used for packaging purposes even if something is printed thereon. It would still be described as a product belonging to the packaging industry and not printing industry. We, therefore, hold that the view taken by the Tribunal needs to be reversed.
In the result, following the afore-mentioned judgment of this Court, we allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Tribunal insofar as it concerns unwaxed printed paper and make no order as to costs.
Appeal Allowed.
