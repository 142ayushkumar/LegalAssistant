Supreme Court of India

17 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11464/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It has been pointed out by learned counsel for the petitioner that schedule which is reproduced in the Judgment is not schedule 2 of the property as mentioned in the plaint. If this mistake is committed by the High Court it would be open to the petitioner to approach the High Court and file review application.
2. In this view of the matter learned counsel for the petitioner seeks leave to withdraw this petition at this stage for approaching the High Court for filing proper review application. The permission is granted.
3.  This special leave petition stands disposed of as withdrawn. The High Court would decide the application for condonation of delay in filing review application, which may be filed by the petitioner, by taking into consideration that the petitioner had approached this Court against the impugned judgment.
Petition disposed of.
