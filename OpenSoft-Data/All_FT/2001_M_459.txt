Mohindro v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 January 2001
Cr.A. No. 18 of 2001 (arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 3142 of 2000), Dt. 4 January 2001.
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The grievance of the appellant is that though she has approached the authority for registering a case against the alleged accused persons but the police never registered a case and never put the law in motion, and therefore, having failed in an attempt in the High Court to get a case registered she has approached this Court. Pursuant to the notice issued the respondents have entered appearance.
Though the learned appearing for the State of Punjab stated that there had been an enquiry, we fail to understand as to how there can be an equiry without registering a criminal case. On the facts alleged, it transpires that the appellant approached the police for registering a case and get the allegation investigated into and yet for no reasons whatsoever the police failed to register the case.
2.  In the aforesaid premises, we allow this appeal and direct that a case be registered on the basis of the report to be lodged by the appellant at the Police Station within a week from today and thereafter the matter will be duly investigated into and appropriate action be taken accordingly. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
