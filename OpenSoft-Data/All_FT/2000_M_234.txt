Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)......CC 8126/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Permission to file S.L.P. granted.
1.  Though the High Court has not given the reasons for dismissal of the revision, but on the admitted position that to the petition filed under Section 397 and 398 of the Companies Act, a detailed reply had been filed by the petitioners on 23rd of September, 1998 and thereafter an application was filed only in February, 1999 invoking the power of the Authority under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
2. The Authority was fully justified in not entertaining that application in view of the fact that earlier statement on merits was filed on 23rd of September, 1998.
3.  The High Court, therefore, was justified in not interfering with revision against the said order. We see no merits in this matter. The S.L.P. is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
