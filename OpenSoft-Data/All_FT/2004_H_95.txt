IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Criminall Appellate Jurisdiction Criminal Appeal No. 353 of 2004
(Arising out of SLP(Crl) No.358 of 2004)
Order:
1. Leave granted.
2. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties we are satisfied that grant of bail to Pratap Mansingh Solanki, Respondent No.2 in this appeal (Applicant No.6 before the High Court) is not sustainable and his bail is cancelled. So far as the other accused respondents to whom bail has been granted are concerned, we do not think it appropriate at this juncture to interfere with the bail granted.
3. The appeal is accordingly allowed to the aforesaid extent in respect of Respondent No.2 and dismissed for others.
Appeal allowed
