Commissioner of Income Tax A. P., Hyderabad v Nathmal Barket Lal Parikh and Company Nizamabad
Supreme Court of India

8 January 1997
C.A. No. 4035 of 1982
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appeal involves the question whether the expenditure of Rs.15,851 incurred by the assessee in replacement of a diesel engine was allowable as revenue expenditure. Since the amount of tax payable on the said sum is quite small we do not propose to go into the said question.
2. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. We leave the question open. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
