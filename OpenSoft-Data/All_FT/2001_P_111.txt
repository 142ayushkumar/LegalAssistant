Dilip Kumar Das v Phanindra Gogoi
Supreme Court of India

9 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9363/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  It is settled position that a second appeal can be maintained only if there is a substantial question of law.
2.  Time and again this Court has stated the said legal position. The High Court in the impugned judgment has not adverted to any question of law, much less substantial question of law. While setting aside the impugned order, we direct the second appeal to be disposed of afresh after formulating the substantial question of law, if any, arising in the matter.
This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
