Vinod Kumar v U.O.I. and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 961/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  As the petitioner was detained preventively under the National Security Act he filed the writ petition challenging the detention. He has since been released on the expiry of the period of detention.
2. We asked Mr. R.K. Jain, learned senior counsel for the petitioner as to why we should retain this special leave petition if the detention will not chase the petitioner for consequences under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976 (SAFEMA). It is submitted that no consequential action can follow under the provisions of that Act. But he submitted that the said detention would stigmatise the petitioner.
3.  As this is not a conviction passed against him and was only a preventive detention there would not be any stigma attached to him unless there is any statutory fall out. We make it clear that there is no stigma on the petitioner on the facts of this particular case on account of the said detention.
4.  The question of law raised, if any, in this special leave petition is not decided by us.
With these observations this Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
