Deep Chand Gobind Ram Asnani v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

26 March 1980
C.A. No. 2813 of 1979.
The Judgment was delivered by: KRISHNA IYER, J.
1.  This appeal which had been heard at some length ended up at a certain stage by a suggestion from the Court to the State to take a realistic view of the situation apart from the merits of the matter. A sum of Rs. 50,000 had been deposited in the trial court by the State when a decree was passed against it and in favour of the appellant. This sum was withdrawn by the appellant although the decree itself was reversed by the High Court.
2. In this Court, the appellant put forward many contentions which were contested by the State-respondent. At the end of it all, we felt that without detailed consideration of the merits of the matter and having regard to the fact that the appellant was absolutely indigent, the Government may allow the appellant to keep a sum of Rs. 50, 000 in full settlement of all his claim including pensionary and other retiral benefits. For the State Shri Lalit today represents that the State has given respectful consideration to the Court's suggestion and has accepted the direction that a sum of Rs. 50,000 be paid to the appellant in full. This sum need not be paid now because it has already been withdrawn by the appellant. Thus we direct that the appellant be entitled to a sum of Rs. 50,000 in full settlement of all his claims and that the State need not pay any amount because the appellant has already received the same by withdrawal from the trial court.
3.  In exercise of our jurisdiction to award costs and having regard to the equities of the situation and in the circumstances of the case, we make a direction that the appellant be paid by the State a sum of Rs. 10,000 by way of costs. This sum will be deposited in three months from today. The appellant will have no more claim whatever. The appeal is disposed of as above.
Order accordingly.
