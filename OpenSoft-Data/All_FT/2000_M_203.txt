Messrs Ayyannar Agencies and Another v Sri Vishnu Cement Limited and Another
Supreme Court of India

10 January 2000
Transfer Petn. (Cri) No. 265 of 1999
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We have noticed that 5 complaints have been filed by the respondents under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act before the Metropoliten Magistrate Court, Chennai. Thereafter one complaint was filed before the Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad against the petitioners in respect of 2 cheques, that too for the same offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act .
2. This petition is for transferring that case to Metropolitan Magistrate, Chennai as parties in all the cases are the same and the offence is of the same nature though sprouted from different cheques. It would be advantageous to all the parties to have all the said cases before the the same Court, contended the learned counsel
3.  We also feel that the transfer prayed for could only be in the interest of justice and also for the convenience of conducting the trial and disposal of all the cases. We, therefore, order transfer of C.C. No. 808 of 1998 titled as M/s. Sri Vishnu Cement v. M/s. Sri Ayyannar Agencies pending before the IVth Metropolitan Magistrate, City Criminal Court, Nampally, Hyderabad to XVIIth Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidaped, Chennai.
