Postmaster General, Central Circle, Nagpur, and another v Radhabai and others
Supreme Court of India

23 April 1969
C. A Nos 761-762 of 1966
The Judgment was delivered by : S. M. Sikri, J.
1. These appeals by special leave arise out of the suit filed by Radhabai and Kamla, plaintiffs, for damages on account of the death of Nathu due to the negligence and rash driving of Shivaram, motor driver who was in the employ of the Government and working under the Postmaster-General, Central Circle, Nagpur.
2. The Additional District Judge decreed the suit awarding only a sum of Rs. 3,600 as damages instead of about Rs. 20,000 claimed by the plaint ills. Both the parties filed appeals to the High Court of Bombay at Nagpur. The High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the Onion of India and the Postmaster General but allowed the appeal filed by the plaintiffs and increased the damages to Rs. 9,000. Having obtained special leave the Union of India and the Postmaster General have filed these appeals against the judgment and decree of the High Court.
3. The Bombay High Court held that the deceased who was driving a Riksha was killed by the negligence of Shivaram, the driver of the truck belonging to the Postal Department, on February 2, 1955, at about 11 p. m. The High Court repelled the argument of the appellants that the Union of India was not responsible for the torts committed by its servants. The High Court further held that the Fatal Accident Act (XIII of 1855) applied to the Union of India.
4. The learned counsel for the appellants stated before us that in view of the decisions of this Court in Superintendent & Legal Remembrancer, State of West Bengal v. Corporation of Calcutta 1964 Indlaw SC 339. and State of Rajasthan v. Mst. Vidhyawati 1962 Indlaw SC 557, he was not in a position to press the appeals.
5. In view of this statement we must dismiss the appeals with costs.
