Union of India v Bhadra Sahakari Sakkare Karkhana Niyamit
Supreme Court of India

31 July 1998
S.L.P. (C) No. 19708 of 1995 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 10 February 1989 in W.P. No. 3398 of 1984 of the High Court of Karnataka, at Bangalore)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner is right when he contends relying upon a Constitution Bench decision of this Court in the case of Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of India 1996 Indlaw SC 1515 that as per Rule 330(b), the payment of duty under protest can be said to have taken place only when a letter of protest was delivered to the proper officer and that date is found by the Assistant Collector to be 15-9-1981.
2. He, therefore, submits that the demand for refund from 1-9-1981 to 14-9-1981 would get time-barred as the application for refund was filed on 17-3-1982. The duty paid for the disputed period amounts to Rs. 37,000 and odd. As the amount involved is too small even though we agree with learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that on the question of law, he is on a stronger footing, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we are not inclined to interfere u/art. 136 of the Constitution of India
The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
