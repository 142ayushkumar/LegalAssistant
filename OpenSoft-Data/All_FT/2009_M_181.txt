Maitreyee Roy Choudhury (Needas) v Aveek Roy Chouwdhury
Supreme Court of India

13 April 2009
TRANSFER PETITION (C.) NO.75 OF 2009
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard both sides.
1.  The petitioner herein is the wife, who seeks transfer of the petition filed by the respondent for divorce in the Court at Alipore, Calcutta, West Bengal to the Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi. The respondent has no objection to the transfer but he has submitted that the petitioner is trying to take the minor child out of India. If there is any such grievance, the respondent would be at liberty to take appropriate proceeding before the appropriate Court and we do not think that this is a ground for not to transfer the case. In case such an application is filed, the appropriate court would dispose of the same at an early date.
2.  Accordingly, we order for transfer of Matrimonial Suit No.2077/08, titled as Aveek Roy Chowdhury Vs. Maitreyee Roy Chowdhury 2009 Indlaw SC 1325 from the Cout of District Judge, Alipore, Calcutta, West Bengal to the District Judge, Tis Hazari, Delhi. The transfer petition is allowed accordingly. All the records are transmitted to the Court at Tis Hazari, Delhi.
Petition allowed
