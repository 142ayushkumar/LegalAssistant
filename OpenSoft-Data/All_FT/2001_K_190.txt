Khedan Ram v State of Jharkhand and Anr
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3533/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This is an application by the complainant against the impugned order which the High Court appears to have passed even without noticing the complainant.
The High Court quashed the cognizance in the case in hand without even noticing the complainant. Obviously the High Court committed error.
2. In that view of the matter, having heard the counsel for the complainant and Mr. S.B. Upadhyay for the accused, we set aside the impugned order and direct that the High Court may re-consider the matter and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.
The appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
