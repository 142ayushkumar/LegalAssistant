Swastik Traders v Indo Burma Petroleum Company Limited
Supreme Court of India

28 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11203/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We are told that the pleadings are complete in the suit. If the suit is the ripe for disposal we permit the petitioner to move an application before the trial court for early disposal of the suit.
2. As the injunction prayed for by the petitioner has not been granted, we agree with the plea made by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the suit requires to be disposed of as expeditiously as possible.
3.  Hence, if any application is made by the petitioner for early disposal, the trial court shall take all steps necessary for disposal of the suit within three months from the date of making such application unless due to laches on the part of the petitioner it cannot be done so. The interim orders passed by this Court shall stand vacated.
With these observations, this special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
