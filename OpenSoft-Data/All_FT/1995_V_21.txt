1.  The appellants herein, who are respondents in CA No. 1578 of 1974 , Dahiben v. Vasanji Kevalbhai, 1995 Indlaw SC 1104 , having been held in the judgment rendered in that appeal today to be protected tenants, this appeal has to be allowed inasmuch as the learned Singh Judge of the High Court decided against the appellants because of his conclusion reached in the related appeal that the appellants are not protected tenants, and so, not entitled to the benefit of Section 32-G of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948
2.  It would, therefore, be open to the legal representatives of the appellants to proceed further as was ordered by Agricultural Lands Tribunal and Mamlatdar in his order dated 16-4-1964, which was upheld by the Assistant Collector, Alpath Prant, Surat on appeal to him and by the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal on revision being preferred to it.
3.  The appeal is allowed accordingly. Parties are left to bear their own costs throughout.
Appeal allowed.
