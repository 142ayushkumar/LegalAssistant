Gian Singh v Punjab Singh & Ors
Supreme Court of India

30 October 2002
C.A. No.9842 Of 1995
The Order of the court as follows:
This is plaintiff's appeal.
1.  The plaintiff herein brought a suit for permanent injunction. The said suit was decreed. The defendant's appeal against the judgment of the trial Court was dismissed by the first appellate Court.
2. However, the High Court allowed the second appeal and consequently, the suit stood dismissed. It is against the said judgment, the plaintiff has preferred this appeal.
3.  This Court, on number of occasions, has repeatedly said that the High Court under Section 100 C.P.C. is first required to frame substantial question of law before deciding the second appeal. Unless substantial question of law is framed, the High Court does not acquire jurisdiction to decide the appeal on merits. In this case what we find is that the High Court without framing any substantial question of law proceeded to decide the appeal. This was not the way to decide the second appeal. On this short ground, thejudgment under challenge deserves to be set aside.
4. We, accordingly, set aside the judgment under challenge and send the matter back to the High Court to decide the second appeal in terms of Section 100 C.P.C.
5.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
