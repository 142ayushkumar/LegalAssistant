Vinod Kumar and Anr v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19318/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On 20th November, 2000 this Court directed a limited notice as under, to be issued to the respondent State:
"Issue notice for the condonation of delay. Issue notice also in the Special Leave Petition. The notice shall indicate that the respondent may show cause why the petition be not disposed of in terms of the judgment in Civil Appeal No. 6750 of 1999 decided on 01st May 2000."
2. There is a delay of 630 days in filing this special leave petition. It appears that the Petitioners felt emboldened into filing this special leave petition in view of the judgment of this Court in C.A. No. 6750/99 delivered on 1.5.2000.
3.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we find that the petitioners herein are not identically situated as those candidates which were allowed a just and equitable relief in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India by our judgment dated 1.5.2000. It is not disputed that the petitioners herein were not even interviewed, and certainly not selected, appointed and then joined in response to appointment letters issued by the State Government to them as was the case with the appellants in Civil Appeal No.6750/99.
4. In our opinion, the petitioners are not entitled to the relief which was allowed under Article 142 of the Constitution by this Court in judgment dated 1.5.2000.
5.  This petition is, therefore, dismissed both on merits as also on the ground of delay.
Petition dismissed.
