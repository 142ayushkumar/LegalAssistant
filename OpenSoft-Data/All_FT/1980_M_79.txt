1.  We have heard Mr. Khanduja, counsel for the respondent Bank and also Mr. Rameshwar Nath for the appellant. An affidavit has been filed by Shri L. N. Shivhare, Managing Director of the respondent Bank (Morena Central Cooperative Bank Ltd.) stating that the appellant cannot be offered a higher pay scale than Rs. 170-5-240-EB-6-270-10-315-15-375. At the Bar it has been stated that this is a new scale sanctioned for all Upper Division Clerks of 'C' Class Banks, according to the Circular dated June 11, 1979 of Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Madhya Pradesh, Bhopal and has been accepted by this Bank for future employment of U.D.Cs. Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case including the fact that the appellant is an experienced U.D.C. we think it just and reasonable to direct that in this new grade, which has been given to him on re-employment, his initial pay should be fixed after giving him seven advance increments of the scale.
2.  This order is made without prejudice to any of the benefits admissible to him with regard to his past employment, such as, gratuity, leave, bonus and provident fund etc. for the period of his previous employment in the Bank. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
