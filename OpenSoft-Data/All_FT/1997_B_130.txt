Bombay Tyres International Ltd. v Collector of Central Excise, Indore
Supreme Court of India

11 July 1997
C.A. No. 1909 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. In spite of our earlier order dated 26-3-1997, the appellant has not produced any material to indicate that the burden of the tax was not passed on to the consumers so that the appellant could claim refund of the tax which was paid under protest on the basis of the judgment of this Court in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of India. 1996 Indlaw SC 1515
2. In our opinion, this alone is sufficient to disentitle the appellant to claim the refund after the decision in Mafatlal. 1996 Indlaw SC 1515
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
