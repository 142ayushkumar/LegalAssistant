State of Andhra Pradesh v Imliban Goshala and Anr
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 6532/2001
The order of the cour was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned direction of the High Court. In these applications the stringent conditions put by the High Court are sufficient for protection of the animals which is of paramount consideration. Mr. Bachawat appearing for the Goshala placed before us an earlier order of this Court in SLP(CRL) Nos.1900-1902/1990 arising from the judgment of Allahabad High Court.
2. The circumstances indicated therein would have no application in the case in hand, and in our view the impugned order does not require any interference by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.
3. The SLPs., one by the State and the other by the Goshala stand dismissed.
4.The trial of the criminal case be expedited.
Appeals Dismissed.
