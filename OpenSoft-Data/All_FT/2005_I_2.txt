Dynamic Logistics Private Limited v I.C.I.C.I. Bank Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

9  May  2005
C.A. No. 3194 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Leave granted.
2. With the consent of the learned counsel for the parties, the appeal is heard finally.
3. An appeal preferred against a decree passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal (D.R.T.), Mumbai is put in issue by filing an appeal before the Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal (D.R.A.T.), Mumbai. On 27th February, 2004, D.R.A.T. directed the appeal being entertained for hearing subject to deposit of 30% of Rs. 23,42,91,487/- within eight weeks from the date of the order. It appears that compliance was not made and the appellant approached the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. The High Court declined to extend the time for compliance with the order of D.R.A.T.
4. Feeling aggrieved the appellant has come up to this Court by filing this appeal by special leave.
5. According to the appellant the compliance was made by depositing the amount in the following manner:
"1. Rs. 1,01,11,000/- on 5th July, 2001 and 8th May, 2002, paid towards T.S. on two occasions.
2. Rs. 1,10,00,000/- on 2nd December, 2004, fixed deposits in I.C.I.C.I.'s custody.
3. Rs. 2,00,00,000/- on 2nd March, 2005 paid as per order of the High Court.
4. Rs. 3,00,00,000/- paid on 31st March, 2005."
6. According to the learned counsel for respondent No. 1 the deposits so made do not amount to compliance with the order of D.R.A.T. It is pointed out that the first amount of Rs. 1,01,11,000/- was pursuant to an offer for one-time-settlement and the deposit relates to a date prior to the date of passing of the order by the Tribunal and therefore cannot be said to have been deposited in compliance with the order of D.R.A.T.
As to the amount of Rs. 1,10,00,000/-, it is pointed out that the amount is lying in fixed deposit in the name of the appellant which cannot be liquidated except by the appellant's consent. As to the fourth item, it is pointed out that the payment is hedged by several terms and conditions and, therefore, does not amount to an unconditional deposit.
7. In response, the learned counsel for the appellant stated under instructions that so far as the first amount of Rs. 1, 01, 11,000/- is concerned, the appellant shall within three days from today deposit the amount with respondent No. 1 by way of demand draft. As to the second amount of Rs. 1,10,00,000/-, it is stated that the appellant shall give its consent in writing to liquidate the fixed deposits and appropriate the amount towards payment.
As regards, the fourth amount, the learned counsel for the appellant states that all the conditions accompanying the payment are withdrawn and the amount may be treated to have been paid unconditionally.
8. We record the statement of the learned counsel for the appellant, as stated hereinabove. The same shall be binding on the appellant.
9. The appellant shall appear before D.R.A.T. within four weeks from today and having made the compliance, as aforesaid, satisfy D.R.A.T. that the amount, as directed by it, in its order dated 27th February, 2004 has been deposited. The delay, if any, in making the deposit shall stand condoned. If D.R.A.T. feels satisfied that 30% of the amount, as directed by it, stands deposited then the appeal shall be entertained and heard on merits. If the amount so deposited, as stated hereinabove, does not amount to 30% as directed by D.R.A.T. then the appeal filed before it shall stand dismissed.
10. The appeal stands disposed of in the above terms.
11. No order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
