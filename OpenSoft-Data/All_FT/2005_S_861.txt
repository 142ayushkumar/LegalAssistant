Chhidda Singh Jat and others v Suresh Chand Tyagi and another
Supreme Court of India

5 August 2005
C.A. No. 994 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard parties.
1.  This appeal is against an order dated 10-1-2003 by which the appellants (herein) have been sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for three months and a fine of Rs.5000 for not having complied with an order dated 17-5-2002.
2.  It appears that in spite of an order of the High Court, passed as far back as 23-10-1997, the Municipality and its officers are not regulating a "nala" which is polluting the fields around it and is also polluting the waters in the wells of the villagers. As the order dated 23-10-1997 was not complied with, on 17-5-2002, the Municipality was again directed to see that the earlier order was complied with within three months.
3. The direction of 17-5-2002 therefore was against those officers who were in charge on 17-5-2002. As the order of 17-5-2002 was again not complied with and a false compliance report was filed, the order dated 10-1-2003 was passed sentencing them and imposing a fine on them.
4.  We, however, find that Appellants 1 and 2 (herein), namely, Chhidda Singh Jat and Darshan Lal Soni were not in office either on 17-5-2002 or on 10-1-2003. They were transferred much before these dates. They, therefore, cannot be said to be in contempt of the order dated 17-5-2002.
5. The appeal, therefore, stands allowed qua Chhidda Singh Jat and Darshan Lal Soni.
6.  We, however, find that the third appellant Gopal Krishan Yadav was the Chairman of the Municipality on the date the order dated 17-5-2002 was passed. No excuse has been shown as to why he did not comply with the order. Therefore, his appeal will stand dismissed.
Appeals disposed of.
