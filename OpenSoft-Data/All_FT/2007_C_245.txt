Leave granted.
1.  Challenge in these appeals is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dismissing the Tax Case Appeals as according to the High Court the case at hand is covered against the revenue in view of the order passed earlier by the High Court in Southern Asbestos Cement Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax (259 I.T.R. 631) 2002 Indlaw MAD 224.
2.  These appeals relate to assessment years 1989-90, 1991- 92 and 1992-93. The core issue is the allow ability of investment allowance under Section 32A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short the Act). The assessing officer was of the view that it is only to be allowed in one assessment year and not several assessment years. The Tribunal and the High Court appear to have proceeded on the basis that in view of Section 43 A (1) of the Act the allowance was to be granted in different assessment years.
3.  Sections 32A and 43 A (1) of the Act read as under:
Section 32A- INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE.

4. Provided that in respect of a ship or an aircraft or machinery or plant specified in sub-section (8B), this sub-section shall have effect as if for the words "twenty-five per cent", the words "twenty per cent" had been substituted:

9. Provided that this clause shall have effect in respect of a ship as if for the word "seventy- five", the word "fifty" had been substituted. Explanation : Where the amount debited to the profit and loss account and credited to the Investment Allowance Reserve Account under this sub-section is not less than the amount required to be so credited on the basis of the amount of deduction in respect of investment allowance claimed in the return made by the assessee under section 139, but a higher deduction in respect of the investment allowance is admissible on the basis of the total income as proposed to be computed by the Assessing Officer under section 143, the Assessing Officer shall, by notice in writing in this behalf, allow the assessee an opportunity to credit within the time specified in the notice or within such further time as the Assessing Officer may allow, a further amount to the Investment Allowance Reserve Account out of the profits and gains of the previous year in which such notice is served on the assessee or of the immediately preceding previous year, if the accounts for that year have not been made up; and, if the assessee credits any further amount to such account within the time aforesaid, the amount so credited shall be deemed to have been credited to the Investment Allowance Reserve Account of the previous year in which the deduction is admissible and such amount shall not be taken into account in determining the adequacy of the reserve required to be credited by the assessee in respect of the previous year in which such further credit is made :
10. Provided that such opportunity shall not be allowed by the Assessing Officer in a case where the difference in the total income as proposed to be computed by him and the total income as returned by the assessee arises out of the application of the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 145 or sub-section (2) of that section or the omission by the assessee to disclose his income fully and truly.

(c) If at any time before the expiry of the ten years aforesaid, the assessee utilises the amount credited to the reserve account under sub-section (4) for distribution by way of dividends or profits or for remittance outside India as profits or for the creation of any asset outside India or for any other purpose which is not a purpose of the business of the undertaking, and the provisions of sub-section
(4A) of section 155 shall apply accordingly :
Provided that nothing in clause (a) shall apply

(b) The balance of investment allowance, if any, still outstanding to the amalgamating company in respect of such ship, aircraft, machinery or plant, shall be allowed to the amalgamated company in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3), so, however, that the total period for which the balance of investment allowance shall be carried forward in the assessments of the amalgamating company and the amalgamated company shall not exceed the period of eight years specified in sub-section (3) and the amalgamated company shall be treated as the assessee in respect of such ship, aircraft, machinery or plant, for the purposes of this section.
(7) Where a firm is succeeded to by a company in the business carried on by it as a result of which the firm sells or otherwise transfers to the company any ship, aircraft, machinery or plant, the provisions of clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (6) shall, so far as may be, apply to the firm and the company. Explanation :
The provisions of this sub- section shall apply only where

(ii) All the liabilities of the firm relating to the business immediately before the succession become the liabilities of the company; and (iii) All the shareholders of the company were partners of the firm immediately before the succession.
(8) The Central Government, if it considers necessary or expedient so to do, may, by notification in the Official Gazette, direct that the deduction allowable under this section shall not be allowed in respect of any ship or aircraft acquired or any machinery or plant installed after such date as may be specified 475 therein.
(8A) The Central Government, if it considers necessary or expedient so to do, may, by notification in the Official Gazette, omit any article or thing from the list of articles or things specified in the Eleventh Schedule.
(8B) notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (8) or the notification of the Government of India in the Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue) No. G.S.R. 870(E), dated the 12th June, 1986, issued there under, the provisions of this section shall apply in respect of,
(a)(i) A new ship or new aircraft acquired after the 31st day of March, 1987 but before the 1st day of April, 1988, if the assessee furnishes evidence to the satisfaction of the Assessing Officer that he had, before the 12th day of June, 1986, entered into a contract for the purchase of such ship or aircraft with the builder or manufacturer or owner thereof, as the case may be;
(ii) Any new machinery or plant installed after the 31st day of March, 1987 but before the 1st day of April, 1988, if the assessee furnishes evidence to the satisfaction of the Assessing Officer that before the 12th day of June, 1986, he had purchased such machinery or plant or had entered into a contract for the purchase of such machinery or plant with the manufacturer or owner of, or a dealer in, such machinery or plant, or had, where such machinery or plant has been manufactured in an undertaking owned by the assessee, taken steps for the manufacture of such machinery or plant :
11. Provided that nothing contained in sub- section (1) shall entitle the assessee to claim deduction in respect of a ship or aircraft or machinery or plant referred to in this clause in any previous year except the previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1989;
(b) A new ship or new aircraft acquired or any new machinery or plant installed after the 31st day of March, 1988, but before such date as the Central Government, if it considers necessary or expedient so to do, may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify 477a in this behalf.
(8C) Subject to the provisions of clause (ii) of sub-section (3), where a deduction has been allowed to an assessee under sub-section (1) in any assessment year, no deduction shall be allowed to the assessee under section 32AB in the said assessment year (hereinafter referred to as the initial assessment year) and a block of further period of four years beginning with the assessment year immediately succeeding the initial assessment year.
12.  Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that Section 43 A (1) relates to fluctuations of foreign exchange and its effect on the valuation of the assets. It has nothing to do with the question as to whether it is allowable in one year. Therefore, the decision relied upon by the High Court has no application.
Learned counsel for the respondent fairly accepted this position.
in that view of the matter, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court, remit the matter to it for fresh adjudication after formulating the question of law involved.
The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent. No costs.
