Asha Chaudhary and Anr v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.22-23/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel after addressing arguments for some time realised that the suit as framed cannot cross the parameters of Section 26 of the Haryana Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, 1972, therefore, the petitioner - plaintiff will have to be advised to file another suit for declaration of title and recovery of possession without in any manner affecting Section 26 of the Act.
2.   Learned counsel also submitted that he would advise the party to rely on Section 14 of the Limitation Act for tiding over the period of delay.
3.  These are matters for the party to satisfy the court if it is permissible under law. We make it clear that we have not taken any decision on the above aspects.
4.  Learned counsel thereupon seeks permission to withdraw these Special Leave Petitions. Accordingly, SLPs are dismissed as withdrawn.
Petitions dismissed.
