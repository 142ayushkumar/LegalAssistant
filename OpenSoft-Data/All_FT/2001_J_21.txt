State of Orissa v Jagadish and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 September 2001
C.A. No. 2655/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this appeal the question raised is as to the date of birth of the respondent. It appears that in the School Admission Register his date of birth was entered as 15.4.1943 while issuing the transfer certificate a mistake was made and his date of birth was entered as 15.4.1939. That is how the date of birth was entered in the service record of the respondent. When the respondent approached the appellant for correction of the record so far as his date of birth is concerned, not having got an appropriate response he filed a Civil Suit for declaration that his date of birth is 15.4.1943 and not 15.4.1939.
2. That suit, however, was dismissed. The matter was carried in appeal. The Appellate Court relying upon the admission register declared his correct of birth as 15.4.1943 and reversed the judgment and decree of the Trial Court. Second Appeal was carried unsuccessfully and hence this appeal.
3.  When on a question of fact First Appellate Court had taken the view his correct date of birth as 15.4.1943 as per the admission register, we do not find there is any good reason to interfere with the order of the High Court. we do not find any substance in the appeal.
The appeal shall stand dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
