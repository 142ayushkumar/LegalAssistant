Krishna Gowda v K.M. Thambirajan
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1634/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The learned senior advocate appearing in support of the petition, upon instructions, submits that the petitioner is no longer interested to proceed with the case. In this view of the matter, special leave petition is dismissed as withdrawn. The learned senior advocate however prayed that the witnesses already examined should be recalled.
2. We are, however, not inclined to pass any order on such a prayer excepting recording that the petitioner would be at liberty to agitate the same before the appropriate forum.
Petition dismissed.
