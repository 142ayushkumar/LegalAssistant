Jindal Paper and Plastics and Another v Union of India and Another
Supreme Court of India

25 March 1997
C.A. No. 2418 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 3685, 3216 and 4076 of 1994)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The principal issue is covered against the appellants by the judgment of this Court in Kasinka Trading v. Union of India1994 Indlaw SC 21831994 Indlaw SC 2183.
This judgment was delivered on 18-10-1994. The same issue was thereafter referred to a larger Bench and the larger Bench came to the conclusion, on 20-12-1996 Shrijee Sales Corpn. v. Union of India, 1996 Indlaw SC 1561, that the judgment in Kasinka Trading 1994 Indlaw SC 21831994 Indlaw SC 2183 was good law.
2.  It is argued on behalf of the appellants that, nonetheless, the award of interest at the rate of 17.5% per annum from the date the duty became payable till it was paid or recovered was uncalled for in view of the fact that the point of law had remained undecided at least until 18-10-1994.
Reference was made to the judgment of this Court in Kashyap Zip Industries v. Union of India 1992 Indlaw SC 7171992 Indlaw SC 717 where, in somewhat similar circumstances, the rate of interest was reduced to 12% per annum.
3.  We are of the view that there was uncertainty about the law until the decision in the case of Kasinka Trading 1994 Indlaw SC 21831994 Indlaw SC 2183 was rendered on 18-10-1994, and that, therefore, interest from the date it became payable until 18-10-1994, should be payable at the rate of 12% per annum.
4. Interest for the further period should be at the rate of 17.5% per annum, as ordered by the High Court. Calculations shall be made accordingly and the balance and interest as aforesaid due by the appellants shall be paid to the respondents within 8 weeks.
5.  The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
