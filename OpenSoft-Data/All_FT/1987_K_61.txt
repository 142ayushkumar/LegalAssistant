Madhu Sudan Malhotra v Kishore Chand Bhandari and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 December 1987
Cr.A. No. 635 of 1987
The Order of the Court is as follows:
Arguments heard.
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are satisfied that in the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court was in error in refusing to grant leave under Section 378(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. We are prima facie inclined to the view that the furnishing of a list of ornaments and other household articles such as refrigerator, furniture electric appliances etc. at the time of the settlement of the marriage amounts to demand of dowry within the meaning of Section 2(1) of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
2.  The appeal is accordingly allowed and the order passed by the High Court is set aside. The High Court will grant the requisite leave under Section 378(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and hear the appeal on merits. The High court will come to its own conclusions and consider the matter afresh, without being influenced by any of the observations made by us. The High Court would also take appropriate steps for return of the articles given to the daughter Anita at the time of her marriage.
Appeal allowed.
