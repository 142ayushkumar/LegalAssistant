Second Income Tax Officer v Stumpp Schuele And Somappa (P) Ltd.
Supreme Court of India

14 September 1990
The Order of the Court was as follows :
These appeals, by leave of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution, are directed against the judgment and order of the, High Court of Karnataka dated 3-7-1975 (Second ITO (1991) 187 ITR 108 (SC): (1991) 94 CTR 160) v. Stumpp Schuele and Somappa (P) Ltd. (1977) 106 ITR 399 1990 Indlaw SC 440), allowing the writ petitions filed by the respondent-assessee and quashing the notices issued under Sections 8 and 16 of the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we do not find any good reason to interfere with the view taken by the High Court. A similar view has been taken by a number of High Courts in Addl. CIT v. Bimetal Bearings Ltd. (1977) 110 ITR 131 (Mad) 1977 Indlaw MAD 79; Commissioner of Surtax v. Ballarpur Industries Ltd. (1979) 116 ITR 528 (Bom)  1978 Indlaw MUM 44; CIT v.
