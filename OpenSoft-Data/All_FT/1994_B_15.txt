Bachan Kaur and Another v Bhagwan Kaur and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 November 1994
C.A. No. ..... of 1994 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 5476 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The main question before the appellate court was with respect to the proof of will said to have been executed by Karnail Singh. The trial court held that the truth and genuineness of the will is not established while the appellate court has taken a contrary view.
2.  Proof of will is not a pure question of fact but a mixed question of fact and law, which is evident from the facts of this case as well. In the circumstances this was not a matter which the High Court should have dismissed in limine. The High Court ought to have admitted the second appeal and decided it on merits.
3.   Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted to the High Court for admitting the appeal and for dealing with it in accordance with law. No costs.
The High Court may consider expeditious disposal of the second appeal.
Appeal allowed.
