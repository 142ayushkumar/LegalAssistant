Bharat Gold Mines Limited, Kolar District v Bharat Gold Mines Untd.Emp.Asscn. and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10529-10549/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  By the impugned order the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka has directed payment of salary for the month of March, 2001, purely as a stop gap arrangement, in view of the fact that budgetary provision has already been made. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the closure of the industry has been permitted under Section 11 (O) of the Industrial Disputes Act by the Central Government with effect from 1st March, 2001 and therefore the question of releasing the salary for the month of March, 2001 does not arise.
2. The fact remains that even if the closure of the factory as permitted by the Government, is upheld by the High Court, the petitioner shall have to pay certain benefits to the employees. Both the learned counsel agree that the amount directed to be paid by the High Court may be released treating the same as ad hoc payment, and not necessarily as salary, and the same shall be available to be treated as payment of salary or payment of benefits to the employees consequent upon closure consistently with the final order to be passed by the High Court. The suggestion is very reasonable and we order accordingly.
The special leave petitions stand disposed of.
3.  We request the High Court to dispose of the matter pending before it expeditiously looking to the nature of the controversy involved.
Petition disposed of.
