Mahinder Singh v State of Himachal Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

31 July 2017
Criminal Appeal Nos. 1286 of 2017 [Arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 5398 of 2017]
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.
3. We have perused the order of the three courts below including the order of the learned Sessions Judge acquitting the accused appellant of the offence under Section 353 IPC. The High Court in appeal was considering an order of acquittal and was expected to consider the matter before it from the limited perspective as to whether the view taken by the first Appellate Court in acquitting the accused appellant was a possible view.
4. Having considered the matter we are of the view that the order of acquittal passed by the learned first appellate court which has been interfered with by the High Court reflects a possible view and, therefore, ought not to have been interfered with.
5. Consequently and for the reasons stated above we allow this appeal; set aside the order of conviction passed by the High Court and acquit the appellant of the aforesaid offence under Section 353 IPC.
6. The appeal is allowed in the above terms.
Order accordingly
