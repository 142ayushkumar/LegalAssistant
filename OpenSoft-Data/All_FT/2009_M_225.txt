Supreme Court of India

22 April 2009
S.L.P. (C) No. 19041/2006
The Order of the Court was as follows:
This matter is delinked from Civil Appeal No. 7922/2002.
1.  We find that the petitioner has filed this SLP seeking leave to challenge the order of a learned Single Judge, even though there is a provision for a writ appeal.
2. We therefore reject this special leave petition relegating the petitioner to the remedy of writ appeal in accordance with law. We are sure if and when he avails of such remedy, the time spent by the petitioner in these proceedings will be excluded.
Petition dismissed.
