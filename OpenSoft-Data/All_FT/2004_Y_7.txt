13 October 2004
C.As. Nos. 124-25 of 2003 with Nos. 1 and ... of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 2557-58 of 2003) and 8141-42 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted in Special Leave Petitions (C) Nos. 2557-58 of 2003.
1.  In the judgment and orders impugned before us, the Division Bench has taken the view that Section 100-A of the Code of Civil Procedure introduced w.e.f. 1-7-2002 is retrospective in effect and would be applicable to the appeals filed before 1-7-2002 as well.
2. Counsel for the parties have brought to our notice that later a Full Bench of the same Court in Rahul Sharad Awasthi v. Ratnakar Trimbak Pandit  has overruled the judgments and orders impugned before us by observing thus:
"The view of the Division Bench in Shri Chandreshwar Bhuthanath Devasthan of Paroda v. Subiraj Pribhakar Naik. that new Section 100-A of the Code brought into force on 1-7-2002 is retrospective completely and shall apply to letters patent appeals which have been filed, admitted and pending is not the correct view and that judgment does not lay down the law correctly."
3.  In this view of the matter, the judgments and orders under appeal are set aside and the matters are remitted back to the High Court for a fresh decision in accordance with law.
In case any stay was operative during the pendency of the letters patent appeals, then the same shall continue to operate till the disposal of the appeals unless varied by the Bench on an application filed by either of the parties.
4.  The civil appeals are allowed accordingly with no order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
