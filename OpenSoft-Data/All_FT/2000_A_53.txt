Abdul Khuddus v H.M. Chandiramani
Supreme Court of India

20 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4691/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1. After hearing the counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the High Court erred in not allowing the review petition and recalling the order dated 2nd August, 1999. It is quite evident from a perusal of the High Court's order in appeal that service of M.F.A. No. 3728/98 filed by the respondent herein, which was pending in the High Court, had not been effected on the appellant herein.
2.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the impugned order and the order dated 2nd August, 1999 and direct the High Court to hear afresh M.F.A. No. 3728/98. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
