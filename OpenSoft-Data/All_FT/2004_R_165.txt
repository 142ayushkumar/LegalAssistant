Mool Shankar Singh v Regional Manager, P. N. B. and Another
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2004
Appeal (Civil) 1591 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In our view the High Court should have considered the grievance of the appellant on merits pertaining to his claim for higher special allowances. Merely because in the earlier writ petition the High Court had provided only for making representation, it would not mean that the matter is closed and the petitioner was not entitled to approach the High Court, later even though the representation was rejected and no relief was granted to him.
The High Court never considered the case on merits.
2.  We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the order passed by the High Court and remand the matter for consideration on merits.
Appeal Allowed
