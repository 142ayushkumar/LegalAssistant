Pinkibasra v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 January 2000
Cr.A. No. 41 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Appellant has highlighted a lot of grievances against the high handedness of the police but the Senior Superintendent of Police, Ludhiana in the reply affidavit has sought to counter all those allegations. In this situation all what we can do is to make the observation that it is open to the appellant to file complaint or complaints before the Magistrate concerned in which necessary allegations or accusations of the various offences committed against him can be described. If any such complaint is filed before a Magistrate the same shall be looked into and the procedure required by law shall be resorted to by the Magistrate concerned.
2. In order to ensure personal protection for the appellant we permit him to make an application before the Magistrate concerned for affording police protection to him. If the Magistrate is satisfied that appellant must be given police protection for the effective prosecution of his case the Magistrate shall pass appropriate orders thereon.
With these observations and directions we dispose of this appeal.
Appeal disposed of.
