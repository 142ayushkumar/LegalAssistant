Azma Tolla v Furnionics and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7604/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In a suit for injunction an application was made under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and2 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
for grant of temporary injunction in favour of the respondents.
2.  However, the trial Court rejected the same.On appeal being made to the High Court the same was allowed. Hence this proceeding before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.
3.  Normally, we would not have interfered with such an order. However, in this case we find that the order made by the trial Court is not capricious or arbitrary to be interfered with by the High Court in an appeal arising from such an interlocutory order.  Therefore, it would be appropriate to continue with the interim order granted by this Court on 10.5.2000 pending disposal of the suit and we direct the trial Court to dispose of the matter within the time as fixed by the High Court.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
