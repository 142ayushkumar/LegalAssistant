Awadhraj Singh Pappu v State of Karnataka and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.)............/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  All that really happened was, prosecution produced an additional paper purported to be the statement of a witness recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
2. Such a late production was taken as exception to by the petitioner accused. Accused said that he should have given that document earlier. But when it was later realised by the .
3.  Public Prosecutor that such a statement under Section 161 should have been supplied to the accused in the interest of justice, it was at his instance that it was sought to be supplied atleast now. We are not inclined to interefere with the impugned orders. However, the observation of the High Court that the Sessions Court should send the said document to the Committal Court and thereafter the Committal Court shall reroute it to the Sessions Court appears to be rather outlandish.
4. The High Court should have avoided such rerouting of a document when the case is pending in the Sessions Court. The document was produced in the Sessions Court directly. Anyway, by now the document would have been given back to the Sessions Court and it is late for us to set right the route.
5.  We make it clear that the course adopted in the impugned order will be without any prejudice to the rights of the accused to challenge the genuineness or validity of the said statement and also for the prosecution to establish that it is genuine and valid.
With the said observations, the special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition Disposed of.
