University of Jammu and Another v Sarfraz Ahmed and Another
Supreme Court of India

28 July 2000
C.A. No. ... of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  After hearing the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant and the learned counsel appearing for the first respondent, we are of the view that the rules framed by the University of Jammu so far as the re-evaluation of examination papers are concerned are valid.
2.  In this case, the learned Single Judge had given a direction that not only Respondent 1, but also Respondent 2 was to be admitted in MCA Course, if necessary by creating one more seat for Respondent 1. This order was affirmed by the Division Bench but now it has been verified by the learned Senior Counsel for the University that the second respondent has not joined the course. In this appeal, notice was issued to Respondent 2, he was served but has not chosen to appear and we set him ex parte.
3. In the circumstances, there can be no objection if the first respondent is accommodated in the available seat in MCA Course. There is no need to create extra seat. The second respondent does not appear to be interested in the seat in MCA Course. While holding that the rules are valid we direct the University of Jammu to admit the first respondent in MCA Course, in the special, peculiar facts of the case.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
