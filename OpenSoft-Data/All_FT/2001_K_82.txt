Tiruchirapalli Co-Op. Wholesale Store Limited v Kalidoss and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 926/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In our view, the impugned order passed by the High Court holding that complaint was not maintainable as the company was not joined as accused in the proceedings is erroneous in view of the judgment rendered by this Court in Anil Hada vs. Indian Acrylic Ltd., 1999 Indlaw SC 853.
2.  Hence the appeal is allowed, impugned order is set aside. However, it is made clear that it would be open to the respondents-accused to raise other contentions before the trial court and the trial court would decide the same in accordance with law.
Appeal allowed.
