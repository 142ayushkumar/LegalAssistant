Rekha Aggarwal (Smt) v Sunil Aggarwal
Supreme Court of India

19 November 1991
Transfer Petition (Civil) Nos. 268-69 of 1991
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard counsel as also the parties themselves and are of the view that the proceedings for restitution of conjugal rights and for custody of the minor child of the parties initiated by the respondent husband in the courts at Amritsar should be transferred to the Court of the District Judge at Delhi for disposal in accordance with law. The District Judge, Delhi may himself hear the matters or have them posted before appropriate courts.
2.   Whichever court is ultimately assigned the matters for disposal should take up the cases quickly and in any case not later than four months from now and should hear the matters day-to-day so that they can be disposed of quickly.
3.  We gather that a number of other cases inter partes are pending. We hope and trust that steps would be taken by the parties themselves so that the cases are disposed of early. The transfer petitions are accordingly allowed. No costs.
Petitions allowed.
