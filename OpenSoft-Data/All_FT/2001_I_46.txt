Industrial Finance Corp. of India Limited v Bihar Sponge Iron Karmachari Sangh and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.21334/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that it is appropriate that Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) should go into the matter once again. The Company has already approached the BIFR and the operating agencies are there. The grievance of the Bihar Sponge Iron Karamchari Sangh (respondent No. 1 herein) which was the petitioner before the High Court is that it had not been heard.
2. We are told that there is a draft Scheme before the BIFR. BIFR should consider the draft Scheme and if it thinks proper approve it with or without modifications after hearing all the parties. It is open to the BIFR, if it thinks fit, to call for a fresh Scheme. BIFR will deal with the matter as expeditiously as possible.
The appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Appeals disposed of.
