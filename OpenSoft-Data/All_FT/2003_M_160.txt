Mary Alvares v Roy Alvares
Supreme Court of India

29 August 2003
Transfer Petition (C) No. 157 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This transfer petition has been filed for transfer of Matrimonial Case No.12 of 2002 entitled Roy Alvares v. Mary Alvares from-the Family Court at Belgaum to the Family Court in Mumbai. The respondent has filed a counter-affidavit dated 9-7-2002, wherein he has annexed an order of the Family Court, Belgaum dated 12-4-2002, disposing of this suit.
2.  Since then, the petitioner has taken time from this Court on various occasions on the ground that a restoration application has been filed.
3. Today, the learned counsel for the petitioner fairly admits that he has no instructions as to what has happened to the restoration application.
4.  This matter cannot be adjourned indefinitely merely because the petitioner does not give instructions to her counsel.
Accordingly, the transfer petition stands dismissed. No order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.
