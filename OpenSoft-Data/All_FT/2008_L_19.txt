Ram Kishan v Lali Alias Krishana
Supreme Court of India

26 September 2008
C.A. No. 5877 of 2008 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 1847/2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Leave granted.
2. The primary question involved in the suit filed by the respondent herein was as to whether she was the daughter of Molhar. That was the first issue framed by the learned Trial Judge. Indisputably, the said issue was determined in favour of the appellant and against the respondent by both the learned Trial Judge and the First Appellate Court.
3. The High Court framed the following question to be the substantial question of law involved in the second appeal preferred by the respondent herein:
"Whether it has been proved from evidence that the appellant is the daughter of Molhar?"
4. By reason of the impugned judgment, the High Court has entered into evidence adduced on behalf of the parties and reversed the findings of fact arrived at by the Courts below. It was, in our opinion, impermissible, as ex-facie the question formulated by the High Court at the time of the admission of the appeal was not a substantial question of law.
5. For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained and it is set aside accordingly. The appeal is allowed.
6. However, in the facts and circumstances of this case, there shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
