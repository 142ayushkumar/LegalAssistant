State of Haryana and Another v Anirudh Kumar (D) Th:Lrs
Supreme Court of India

11 February 2008
Appeal (Civil) 1266 of 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 2108 of 2007)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal by Special Leave is directed against the judgment and order dt.03.05.2006 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in C.W.P.No.5850 of 1989 by which the High Court had directed back wages to be paid till the date of award. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials on record and considering the fact that the deceased respondent did not work during the period in question, we are of the view that the legal heirs of the deceased respondent should be paid 50% of back wages. We order accordingly.
2. The order of the High Court is modified to the extent indicated above. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of
