Roshan Kohli v Amitava Mukherjee
Supreme Court of India

11 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9860-9861/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After we heard the matter, we do not find any merit in these petitions. The special leave petitions are, therefore, dismissed.
2.  It was then urged by learned counsel for the petitioner that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises immediately, it shall create great hardship to him.
3. Therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is justified.
4.  We, therefore, grant time till 30th June, 2002, to the petitioner to vacate the premises on his filing usual undertaking in this Court within three weeks from today.
Petitions dismissed.
