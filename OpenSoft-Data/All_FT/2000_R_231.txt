Anuradha Dalal v Rohit Dalal
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2000
Transfer Petition (C) No. 458 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner is the wife of the respondent. She seeks transfer of Application No. 145 of 1998 (titled Major Rohit Dalal v. Anuradha Dalal) pending in the Ist Family Court, Jaipur (Rajasthan) to the Competent Court of District Judge at Bhiwani (Haryana).
2.  The grounds on which transfer of the case is sought are that she is living in Bhiwani (Haryana) and has to travel a distance of 300 k.m. (one way) which takes about 8 hours to reach Jaipur; that since in the Family Court at Jaipur advocates are not permitted, she has to attend on every date of hearing which is causing great hardship.
3. The respondent, it is submitted, is also not residing in Jaipur but is residing at different places for discharging his official duties. Therefore, it would not cause any inconvenience to the respondent also.
4.  In the counter-affidavit, filed by the respondent, it is not disputed that in Jaipur the parties have to be present in person and the advocates are not permitted.
5. However, what is stated is that the father of the petitioner has a lot of influence and, therefore, it would not be conducive for the respondent to have the proceedings conducted in Bhiwani, which fact is denied by the petitioner.
6.  The learned counsel for the parties, however, agreed that instead of Bhiwani the case may be transferred to any court in Delhi. For the aforementioned reasons, we order transfer of Application No. 145 of 1998 to the District Judge, Tis Hazari, Delhi, who may try the case himself or allocate it to some other competent Judge for trial. The transfer petition is allowed accordingly.
Petition allowed.
