Ram Singh v Shakuntla Devi
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.536-537/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  These applications have been filed for extension of time to vacate the premises. Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant-petitioner had given an undertaking before the High Court of Delhi to vacate the premises by 31.12.2000, a limited notice had been issued to the respondent to indicate why the applicant should not be allowed to continue in the premises till 30th of April, 2001 for the reasons indicated in the applications.
2. The respondent has filed a counter-affidavit indicating the difficulties which she would suffer in the event the applicant is allowed to continue in the premises till 30th April, 2001. When the matter was called, there was no response from the applicant. Even on the second call also the applicant is not present.
3.  But, having heard the learned counsel for the respondent, we see no justification for allowing any extension of time to the applicant for vacating the premises. The Special Leave Petitions stand rejected. The petitioner must vacate the premises forthwith.
Petition dismissed.
