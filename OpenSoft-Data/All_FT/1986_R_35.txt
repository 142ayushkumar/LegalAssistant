State of Haryana and others v Rajinder Kumar and others
Supreme Court of India

1 December 1986
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 9126 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is considerable force in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the amount of costs awarded is out of proportion having regard to the amount of compensation involved. The compensation amount of Rs.2250/- alongwith interest etc. came to Rs.7137 10 and under the circumstances the High Court should not have awarded as much as Rs 10,000/- as costs.
2. The High Court possibly felt annoyed or was upset because of the delay in paying the amount of compensation and awarded excessive costs to this extent.
3.  However, we do not think that we would be justified in interfering with the order passed by the High Court since both the parties will have to incur costs in excess of Rs.10,000/- if we grant leave in order to modify the amount of costs awarded by the High Court.
4. We, therefore, do not propose to interfere with the order. With these observations, the special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
