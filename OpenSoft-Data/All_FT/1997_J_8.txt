Supreme Court of India

2 December 1997
C.As. Nos. 11477-11479 of 1995 with No. 10010 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals have been filed by the Draftsmen employed in the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Ministry of Defence, Government of India. They have claimed that Draftsmen in Grade III should be given the pay scales of Draftsmen Grade II of the CPWD and Draftsmen Grade II should be given the pay scales of Draftsmen Grade I in the CPWD on the basis of the office memorandum dated 13-3-1984. The Central Administrative Tribunal by the impugned judgments after taking into consideration the educational qualifications for the post of Draftsmen Grade II and Grade III in the DRDO and Draftsmen Grade I and Grade II in the CPWD, has held that the appellants are not entitled to the said pay scales
2.  We have heard the learned counsel for the appellants in support of the appeals. The learned counsel have placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Union of India v. Debashis Kar 1995 Indlaw SC 20031995 Indlaw SC 20031995 Indlaw SC 2003.
3.   After considering the qualifications which are prescribed for appointment for the post of Draftsmen Grade II and Grade III in the DRDO and comparing the same with the qualifications prescribed for the posts of Draftsmen Grade III, Grade II and Grade I in the CPWD, we are of the view that the Tribunal has rightly negatived the claim of the appellants. We, therefore, find no merit in the appeals and the same are accordingly dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
