In Re: Chandan Mitra and Another
Supreme Court of India

27 March 1997
Suo Motu Contempt Petition (Cr.) No. 57 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The contemners are present in person. They have tendered an unqualified apology in writing making it clear through their counsel, Shri Ram Jethmalani that neither of them pleads any justification. The contemners, who are present in person, reiterate their unqualified apology and assure us that there would be no repetition of any such act in future by any of them. Shri Ram Jethmalani, Senior Counsel for the contemners, assures us on behalf of the contemners as well as on his own behalf, on behalf of Shri Arun Jaitley and the other learned counsel appearing with him that after deliberations with the contemners over a long duration, they are fully satisfied that both the contemners understand the gravity of the act and are genuinely repentant for their conduct and that they are satisfied about the genuineness of their assurance to ensure avoidance of any such repetition in future.
2. We have administered a stem warning to the contemners.
3. In these circumstances, we are inclined to the view that the unqualified apology tendered by the contemners without making even an attempt to plead any justification from the outset should be accepted.
4. Accordingly, we accept their unqualified apology coupled with the assurance as aforesaid. The notice is discharged.
Order accordingly.
