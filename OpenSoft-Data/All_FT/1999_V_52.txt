Union of India v Vishwa Hindu Parishad (V.H.P.)
Supreme Court of India

20 January 1999
C.A. No. 8092 of 1995, Dt. 20 January 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  A notification was issued on 14-1-1995 under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 by the appellant declaring the respondent as an unlawful association which would become effective on confirmation under Section 4 of the Act and be in force for a period of two years.
2. The declaration made by the Government was required to be considered by a Judge of the High Court who constituted a Tribunal for confirmation under Section 4 of the Act.
3.  The Tribunal after considering the grounds leading to the notification dated 14-1-1995 declaring the Vishwa Hindu Parishad as an unlawful association under the said Act cancelled the same. Against the said order this appeal has been preferred.
4.  Even if the notification had been confirmed by the Tribunal it would have been effective for a period of two years. The Tribunal had made the order on 20-6-1995.
5. We think no useful purpose would be served by pursuing the appeal any further as such period has already elapsed.
6.  The appeal is dismissed as having become infructuous with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
