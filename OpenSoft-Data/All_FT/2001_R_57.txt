Ragi Veerachary v State of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 679-680/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn our attention to the language used by the learned single judge of the High Court indicating that Supreme Court was not correct in understanding the judgment delivered by the Addl.Session Judge while disposing of the appeal. We have noticed the said observation made by the learned Single Judge of the High Court (Siddappa, J.).
2. We agree with the learned counsel that the learned Single Judge should have used a better language while dealing with the matter remitted by this Court, in conformity with the comity usually followed in such matters. Nonetheless we have chosen to refrain from using any language on the basis of what is employed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court.
We have gone through all the judgments and found that the petitioners stand convicted under Section 411 and sentence of rigorous imprisonment for nine months has been awarded. Considering the large amount involved, we do not think it necessary to interfere with the sentence awarded to him.
We, therefore, dismiss these SLPs.
Petitions dismissed.
