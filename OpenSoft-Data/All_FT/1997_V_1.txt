Uttam Namdeo Mahale v Uttam Namdeo Mahale
Supreme Court of India

7  May  1997
Civil Appeal No. 3691 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal has been filed against the order of the High Court of Bombay, made on January 20, 1997 in Writ Petition 6182 of 1996.
2.  The admitted position is that the respondent No.1. is the owner of the property and earlier a notice was issued to the appellant to vacate the land in question. That order of eviction became final with the confirmation of the order by this Court in a special leave petition. Thereafter, proceedings were initiated for execution. An objection has been raised on the ground that since more than 12 year shave elapsed, the order cannot be implemented. The High Court has pointed out that under Section 21 of the Mamlatdar's Court Act, 1906, it has not prescribed any limitation for execution of the orders vide the Division Bench judgment of the High Courtof Bombay in Babaji Khandujivs. Kushaba Ramji [8 BombayLaw Reporter (1906) 218].
3.  Mr. Bhasme, learned counsel for the appellant, contends that in the absence of fixation of rule of limitation, the power can be exercised withina reasonable time and in the absenceof such prescription of limitation, the power to enforcethe order is vitiatedby error of law. He places reliance on the decisions in State of Gujarat vs. Patel Raghav Natha &Ors. [(1970) 1 SCR 335 1969 Indlaw SC 176]; Ram Chand & Ors. vs Union of India& Ors.[(1994)1 SCC 44 1993 Indlaw SC 1507 ]; andMohamadKavi MohamadAmin vs. Fatmabai Ibrahim [CA No. 5023/85 decided on August 22, 1996 1996 Indlaw SC 2325]. We find no force in the contention. It is seen that the order of ejectment against the applicant has become final. Section 21 of the Mamalatdar's Court Actdoes not prescribe any limitation within which the order needs to be executed. In the absence of anyspecific limitation provided thereunder, necessary implication is that the generallaw oflimitation provided in Limitation Act (Act 2 of 1963) standsexcluded. The Division Bench, Therefore, has rightlyheld that no limitation has been prescribed and it can beexecuted at any time, especially when the law of limitation for the purpose of this appeal is not there. Where there is statutory rule operating in the field, the implied power of exercise of the right within reasonable limitation does not arise. The cited decisions deal with that area and bear no relevance to the facts.
The appealis accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed
