Amarchand Dalani v Mr. Justice G. G. Sohani, Actg. Chief Justice, High Court of M. P., Jabalpur and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 November 1986
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 13098 of 1986 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 10 October 1986 of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in Misc. Petition No. 3256 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
1.  But we would like to observe that members of the subordinate judiciary should not be frequently transferred without compelling reasons and ordinarily they should not be transferred before the expiration of the period laid down by the High Court for transfer in regard to any particular station and as far as possible no transfer should be effected in mid-term unless compelled by administrative exigencies.
2.   Otherwise, it would not only cause personal hardship an inconvenience to the members of the subordinate judiciary but would also have the effect of demoralising them and would be likely to affect performance of judicial work.
Petition dismissed.
