The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. I.A.Nos.1448-1449 in W.P.(C) No. 202/1995 :
On the basis of vague nature of averments and that too by association and Not by individual industries, it is Not possible to grant the prayer which is for rejection of report submitted by CEC and for quashing the order dated 21st June, 2005 granting sanction for licenses being issued to six new wood based industries. I.A.Nos.1448-1449 are, accordingly, dismissed.
2. I.A. No. 1240 with I.A.Nos.1266,1299,1341 and 1382 in W.P.(C) No. 202/1995 :
On request of Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel appearing for the Andaman and Nicobar Administration, adjourned for six weeks. Additional affidavit may be filed in the meanwhile.
3. Contempt Petition (C) No. 247/2005 in W.P.(C) No. 202/1995 :
This petition has been filed by Mr. Naidu Prakash, resident of Secunderabad, claiming to be an active environmentalist belonging to the State of Andhra Pradesh. He also claims to be Director, A.P. Forest Development Corporation. The applicant is Not a party in these proceedings. Except stating that he is an environmentalist, No details as to his antecedents have been given in the application. We are, therefore, Not inclined to entertain the petition filed by him. At the same time, however, serious averments have been made in the prayer that only 100 private units were there in the country at the time when ban was imposed by this Court and Now the number has gone to 1700. Some annexures have been filed with the application.
4. In this view, we would substitute CEC as the petitioner to assist this Court.
5. Mr. Naidu Prakash may supply such information, as he may have, to the Secretary of CEC.
6. We would treat this contempt Petition as I.A. in the application.
7. Notice for the present be issued to the State of A.P., State of Haryana and State of Uttaranchal.
8. I.A. No. 1177 in I.A.Nos.742-743 in W.P.(C) No. 202/1995 :
None is present for the State of Rajasthan. However, in the affidavit dated 29th November, 2005 filed on behalf of the State Government, it has inter alia been stated that a revised proposal for 30.70 hectares pf forest land was sent for diversion to MoEF only with regard to 19 mining leases existing on the date. The total area for which first stage clearance was granted was 54 hectares.
9. While adjourning the matter because of the absence of counsel for the State, we have asked Mr. A.D.N. Rao to take instructions from MoEF on the plea of alleged revised proposal having been sent by the State Government to the MoEF and stage thereof.
10. The affidavit also refers to the order dated 2.6.2005 having been passed by the State Government. Copy of that order shall be placed on record by the State Government after supplying it to the counsel for the applicant.
11. List the matter in the month of January, 2006.
12. I.A.Nos.1234, 1372 & 1391 in W.P.(C) No. 202/1995 : List in the month of January, 2006.

16. The appeals are allowed in terms of the signed order.
C.A. No. 7417/2005 @ SLP(C) No. 15562/2004 : Leave granted.
17. In the first appeal filed by the plaintiff-respondents herein, the High Court by the impugned judgment setting aside the order of the trial court rejecting the application for injunction, allowed those applications and permitted the plaintiff/respondents to do agricultural operations in the area where Vanilla plants have already been planted and certain other directions were also issued. The operation of the impugned judgment of the High Court has been stayed by this Court. Now the suits have been decided and we are told that one set of appeals are pending in the High Court and aNother set in the District Court, having regard to valuation of the suits.
18. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are of the view that the interim order passed by this Court shall continue till the decision of the appeals which will mean that there will be No interim order in favour of the respondent- plaintiffs but at the same time the appeals pending in the District Court and/or High Court deserve to be disposed of expeditiously. The parties may bring this order to the Notice of the courts where the appeals are pending so that the same can be disposed of as early as possible.
19. The impugned order is set aside and the appeal is allowed. C.A. No. 7418/2005 @ SLP(C) No. 15578/2004, C.A. No. 7503 /2005 @ SLP(C) No. 16106/2004, C.A. No. 7419/2005 @ SLP(C) No. 26033/2004,C.A. No. 7421/2005 @ SLP(C) No. 25791/2004 & C .A. No. 7420/2005 @ SLP(C) No. 26032/2004 :
