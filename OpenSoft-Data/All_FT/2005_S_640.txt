Manjit Kaur v State of Punjab and others
Supreme Court of India

14 February 2005
Cr.A. No. 303 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 5277 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  In a petition filed under Section 482 CrPC in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, the appellant had prayed for a direction to the respondents to investigate the complaint dated 30-9-2003 lodged with the SSP, Batala and for taking action in accordance with law against the accused persons. The High Court disposed of the petition by a cryptic order which reads as follows:
"In view of the reply filed by Respondent 2 along with the report Annexure R-1, no direction is required to be issued to the petitioner. However, the petitioner is given liberty to avail his remedy of private complaint. Dismissed."
2.  On a reading of the order the reasons which weighed with the High Court in dismissing the petition are not clear. There is also no apparent reason for making an observation that the petitioner shall be given liberty to file a private complaint.
3. A reading of the reply filed by Respondent 2 Deputy Commissioner, Gurdaspur does not spell out in clear terms what action has been taken and proposed to be taken. The least the High Court should have done, in the circumstances of the case, was to pass a reasoned order.
4.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we consider it just and proper to set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court for fresh disposal of Criminal Misc. Petition No. 59048-M of 2003. The High Court shall pass a reasoned order as expeditiously as possible.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
