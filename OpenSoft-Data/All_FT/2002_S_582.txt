State of Punjab v Joga Singh
Supreme Court of India

29 October 2002
Cr.A. No.1036 Of 1995State Of Punjab Appellant(s)
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  The State is in appeal against the refusal of grant of leave in a matter wherein the accused Joga Singh was sent to trial for offence under Section 302 IPC. The learned Sessions Judge, in a rather detailed judgment, dealt with the circumstances with all possible scrutiny of evidence and came to a conclusion that the prosecution has not been able to prove any piece of circumstantial evidence in a manner convincing which if read together would make a complete chain in itself and which may lead the Court to the only conclusion that the crime was committed by the accused and by no one else.
2. The law, as regards the acceptability of circumstantial evidence, stands well settled and the learned Sessions Judge, we feel imperative to note, has recorded the same appropriately and there cannot be any exception thereto.
3.  It is on this score that the High Court was pleased to reject the application for leave and thus recorded its inability to entertain the appeal and hence the proceedings before this Court under Article 136 upon grant of leave. On perusal of the evidence on record and having regard to the finding of the learned Sessions Judge, we neither find any perversity nor any infraction of law. The snap in the chain of events is rather apparent and the chain is not complete at all by any string of evidence as the witnesses contradiction rendered the chain of events totally inaccurate and unreliable.
4. We do not see any infraction of law and we, thus, record our concurrence with the order of rejection of the application for leave and the refusal to entertain the appeal so far as the High Court is concerned.
5. This appeal accordingly fails and, therefore, is dismissed. Bail bonds shall stand discharged.
Appeal dismissed.
