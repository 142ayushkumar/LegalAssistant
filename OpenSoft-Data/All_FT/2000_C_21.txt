Sukhdeo Nayak v Canara Bank and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 November 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that mortgage suits are not liable to be transferred to the Debt Recovery Tribunal, nor are we satisfied with the contention that the powers of the Tribunal under the Act (Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions) Act, 1993 ), are more restricted than the powers of the Civil Courts.On the other hand, powers of the said Tribunal have been held by this Court, to be wider than the powers of the Civil courts.
Hence, mortgage suits get automatically transferred to the Tribunal.
The Special Leave Petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
