Messrs Cox and Kings (India) Limited v Mela Adhikari, Kumbh Mela Allahabad and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.1976/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This SLP is directed against an order of the Commissioner dated 27th January 2001. The matter had been remitted to the Commissioner when earlier the petitioner had approached this Court against the order of Allahabad High Court and in course of proceedings parties agreed that the matter should be remitted back to the Commissioner.
2. Against the order of the Commissioner, the aggrieved person can approach the High Court. Instead of approaching the Tribunal, Special Leave Petition has been filed.
3.  We see no justification for entertaining this petition by invoking jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution when the Commissioner, an inferior tribunal, who is subjected to writ - 2 - jurisdiction of the High Court.
4. In that view of the matter, it will be open for the petitioner to approach the Allahabad High Court in assailing the order of the Commissioner since the Commissioner has directed that the possession be delivered on 31.1.2001. The said period is extended by one more day subject to any direction to be given by Allahabad High Court.
5.  We make it clear that we are not expressing any opinion on merits against the order of the Commissioner.
The SLP is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
