Assistant Commissioner (Judicial), Sales Tax and Others v Kheria Brothers and Another
Supreme Court of India

25 August 1998
C.As. Nos. 4210-11 of 1998 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 5800-01 of 1996)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The writ petitions of the respondents were allowed by a learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court on the premise that relief was due to the petitioners on the basis of the judgment reported as State of U.P. v. Annapurna Biscuit Mfg. Co.  1973 Indlaw SC 5251973 Indlaw SC 525
2. It transpires that the case of Annapurna Biscuit Mfg. Co.  1973 Indlaw SC 5251973 Indlaw SC 525 was based upon earlier decisions of this Court in R. Abdul Quader and Co. v. STO  1964 Indlaw SC 3281964 Indlaw SC 328 and Ashoka Marketing Ltd. v. State of Bihar  1970 Indlaw SC 1041970 Indlaw SC 104
3.  While so, in R. S. Joshi v. Ajit Mills Ltd.  1977 Indlaw SC 981977 Indlaw SC 98 seven-Judge Bench of this Court overruled Ashoka Marketing Ltd. case  1970 Indlaw SC 104.
4. The consequent result of such overruling was that Annapurna Biscuit Mfg. Co. decision  1973 Indlaw SC 5251973 Indlaw SC 525 was based got pro tanto overruled. Later in Kasturi Lal Hartal v. State of U.P.  1986 Indlaw SC 4581986 Indlaw SC 458 the overruling of Ashoka Marketing case has  1973 Indlaw SC 5251973 Indlaw SC 525. specifically been noticed but somehow there is no advertence to Annapurna Biscuit Mfg. Co. case  1973 Indlaw SC 5251973 Indlaw SC 525. This incidence by itself can by no means be allowed to gather the impression that Annapurna Biscuit Mfg. Co. case  1973 Indlaw SC 5251973 Indlaw SC 525 was still surviving. That case, as said before, stands pro tanto overruled. It could not have been the basis to grant relief to the respondents by the High Court.
5.  We, therefore, allow these appeals, set aside the impugned orders of the High Court remitting the cases back to it for rehearing of the writ petitions on points other than those which were based on Annapurna Biscuit Mfg. Co. case  1973 Indlaw SC 5251973 Indlaw SC 525.Ordered accordingly. No costs.
Order accordingly.
