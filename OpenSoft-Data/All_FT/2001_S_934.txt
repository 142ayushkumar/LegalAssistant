Emmanuel Education Society v State of Maharashtra and Others
Supreme Court of India

29 August 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 174-175 OF 1999
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  During the pendency of these appeals a statement was made on 23.1.1998 that the respondent No. 1 has decided to give the appellant society the requisite benefit for the academic year 1997-98 and subsequently.
2.  This matter was further clarified by this Court by an order made on 26.7.2000 that the grant-in-aid will cover not only the Primary School but also the Secondary School.
3.  The appellant society also made an application for enhancement of the fees that are to be charged in the school and that application has now been disposed by the respondent-Education Officer.
4. In view of these developments learned counsel for the appellant seeks leave of the Court to withdraw the appeal with liberty to pursue such other remedies as to fixation of fees in the School or otherwise.
5.  With the liberty as aforesaid, the Civil appeal No. 174/1999(arising out of SLP(C) No. 1498/97 against the order in Writ petition No. 2328/1996 filed by the Management) is dismissed as withdrawn. So far as the back wages to be paid to the teachers in the School is concerned, on an overall consideration of the matter particularly bearing in mind that the School was not aided with grant at all in the year 1997, we think it appropriate to reduce the back wages to 50%. The Civil appeal No. 175/1999(arising out of SLP(C) No. 1499/97 against the order in W.P.(C) No. 4863/95 filed by the teachers) shall stand disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
