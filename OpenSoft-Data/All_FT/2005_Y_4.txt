Yash Pal v Ram Lal and others
Supreme Court of India

18 February 2005
C.A. No. 1300 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 6135 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay in filing the rejoinder-affidavit is condoned.
Leave granted.
The counsel for the parties are heard on merits.
1.  The High Court in exercise of revisional jurisdiction has reversed the orders of the subordinate authorities and disturbed the concurrent finding recorded in favor of the appellant landlord that the tenant had unlawfully sub-let the leased premises. The two authorities under the Rent Act subordinate to the High Court had relied on public records in the shape of the house assessment register for coming to a finding that the tenant had unlawfully sub-let the premises. Except the oral evidence of the respondents, there was no other evidence in support of his claim of creation of direct relationship of tenancy with the appellant landlord. We have read the relevant part of the impugned order of the High Court.
2. We find that the High Court has exceeded its revisional jurisdiction in reassessing the evidence and upsetting the concurrent finding of fact reached by the courts below. The house assessment register was a relevant piece of evidence and rightly relied upon by the authorities below in comparison to the oral evidence of the opposite party which had been seriously disputed by the appellant landlord. In these circumstances, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned order of the High Court and restore the orders made by the authorities below.
3.  Since the respondent is carrying on his livelihood in the premises, we grant him six months' time to vacate the premises on his filing usual undertaking supported by an affidavit in this Court within three weeks.
Appeal allowed.
