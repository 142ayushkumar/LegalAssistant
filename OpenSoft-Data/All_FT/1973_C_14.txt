1.  In the view of the material which has been placed before us indicating the "appellant", a highly educated and cultured individual, was suffering from mental aberration when he committed the offence of sodomy, and that, as a result of this conviction, he will suffer loss of service and other serious consequences to his career,
we confirm the conviction but reduce the sentence to the period already undergone which is said to be more than two months. The appellant, who is in jail, shall be released forthwith.
Order Accordingly.
