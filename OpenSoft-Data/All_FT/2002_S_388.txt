Jaswinder Singh Bobby v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

9 January 2002
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 6593/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Learned counsel appearing for the State of Haryana fairly states that he has ascertained that co-accused - Bittoo against whom the case of the prosecution was similar as the petitioner herein, has been released on bail by the High Court. Regarding similar prayer made by the petitioner the High Court mere stated `bail declined' in the order. We do not find that there is any good reason for rejecting the prayer of bail of the petitioner.
2. Accordingly, the order passed by the High Court declining the petitioner's prayer for bail is set aside. It is ordered that the sentence passed against the petitioner shall remain suspended during pendency of the appeal and the petitioner shall be released on bail on execution of a bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties each fo the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.
The SLP is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
