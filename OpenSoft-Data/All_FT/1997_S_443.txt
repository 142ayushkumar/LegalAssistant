The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this SLP a strong reliance is placed on a decision of a three-Judge Bench of this Court by learned counsel for the petitioner in Sin Ram v. State of Haryana .
2. We are told that therein the view taken is that even though the claimant restricted his claim before the trial court, he can request the court of appeal to increase the claim in the appeal by filing deficit court fee. We are informed that a contrary view has been taken by this Court in M. Govinda Raju v. Special Land Addl. Land Acquisition Officer 1996 Indlaw SC 940 and that view is after the view of the three-Judge Bench aforesaid.
2.   In our view, therefore, it will be proper to place this SLP for appropriate orders before a Bench of three learned Judges. Office to obtain appropriate orders from the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India in this connection.
Order accordingly.
