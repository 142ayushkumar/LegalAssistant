Joint Commissioner of Income Tax v Madideep Engineer and Pkg. India Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

12 April 2006
C.A. No. 2196 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The point involved in the present case is whether sections 80HH and 80-I of the Income-tax Act, 1961 are independent of each other and therefore a new industrial unit can claim deductions under both the sections on the gross total income independently or that deduction under section 80-I can be taken on the reduced balance after taking into account the benefit taken under section 80HH.
2.  The Madhya Pradesh High Court in J.P. Tobacco Products Ltd v. CIT 1996 Indlaw MP 265 took the view that both the sections are independent and, therefore, the deductions could be claimed both under sections 80HH and 80-I on the gross total income. Against this judgment a special leave petition was filed in this Court which was dismissed on the ground of delay on 21-7-2000  The decision in J.P. Tobacco Products Ltd s case (supra) was followed by the same High Court in the case of CIT v. Alpine Solvex Ltd. Special leave petition against this decision was dismissed by this Court on 12-1 -2001 (2000 Indlaw SC 260).
3. This view has been followed repeatedly by different High Courts in a number of cases against which no special leave petitions were filed meaning thereby that the department has accepted the view taken in these judgments. CIT v. Nima Specific Family Trust 2000 Indlaw MUM 66; CIT v. Chokshi Contacts Ltd 2001 Indlaw RAJ 15; CIT v. Amod Stamping 2004 Indlaw GUJ 282 (Guj.); CIT v. Mittal Appliances Ltd. 2004 Indlaw MP 33; CIT v. Rochiram and Sons 2004 Indlaw RAJ 36 (Raj.); CIT v. Prakash Chandra Basant Kumar  (MP); CIT v. S.B. Oil Industries  Ltd. 2004 Indlaw PNH 145; CIT v. SKGEngineering Ltd. 2005 Indlaw DEL 246 and CIT v. Lucky Laboratories Ltd. 2005 Indlaw ALL 180.
4.  Since the special leave petitions filed against the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court have been dismissed and the department has not filed the special leave petitions against the judgments of different High Courts following the view taken by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, we do not find any merit in this appeal. The department having accepted the view taken in those judgments cannot be permitted to take a contrary view in the instant case involving the same point. Accordingly, the civil appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
