1. Leave granted.
2. The appellant is aggrieved since the order for reinstatement passed by the Labour Court has been interfered by the High Court substituting the Award with onetime payment of compensation of Rs.75,000/-.
3. Having regard to the period of work starting from 1984 through intermittently upto the year 1993, we are of the view that the interest of justice should be advanced in case the compensation is slightly enhanced and fixed at Rs.2,00,000/-. Therefore, it is ordered that the appellant shall be entitled to compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- and there shall be no further claim with respect to the appellant's engagement with the respondent. We make it clear that this is in addition to whatever has already been paid to the appellant. The amount shall be paid within six weeks from today.
4. The appeal is allowed with no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed
