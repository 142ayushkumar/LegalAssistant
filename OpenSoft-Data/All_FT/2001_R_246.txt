Konkan Railway Corporation Limited and Another v Rani Construction Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

25 April 2001
C.A. Nos. 5880-5889 of 1997 with C.A. Nos. 713 to 716 of 1999, 2037 to 2044 of 1999, 4311, 4312, 4324, 4356, 7304, 7306 to 7309 of 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This reference has been made by a detailed referral order, in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. v. Rani Construction (P) Ltd.
2.  It appears that the Chief Justice or his nominee, acting under section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, have decided contentious issues arising between the parties to an alleged arbitration agreement and the question that we are called upon to decide is whether such an order deciding issues is a judicial order or an administrative order.
3.  In the course of the short hearing before us, another question has surfaced, which is: does the Chief justice or his nominee, acting under section 11, have the authority to decide any contentious issues between the parties to the alleged arbitration agreement?
4. In other words, is the power of the Chief justice or his nominee under section 11 restricted to the nomination of an arbitrator in cases falling under sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) thereof?
5.  From what we understood, the learned Solicitor General appearing for the appellant, and learned counsel appearing for the respondents, are ad idem on this aspect. According to both of them, the power of the Chief justice or his nominee under section 11 is restricted to the nomination of an arbitrator and the order that he makes is an administrative order.
6.  It, therefore, becomes necessary to request the Attorney General to assist the court. Mr. Andhyarujina, who is in court but is not appearing in the matter, has advanced some submissions before us. He shall also be entitled to do so when the matter is taken up again before a Constitution Bench.
7.  The Registry shall furnish a copy of this order and a copy of the paper books both to the Attorney General and to Mr. Andhyarujina. Adjourned accordingly.
Order accordingly.
