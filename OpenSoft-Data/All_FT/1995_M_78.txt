15 December 1995
Appeal (civil)  12094 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  Passing the Hindi test is a condition for promotion and since the appellant had passed the test on September 20, 1981, he was given promotion and seniority was fixed with effect from the passing of the said test. Under these circumstances, we do not find any illegality in the order passed by the Tribunal warranting interference.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal Dismissed
