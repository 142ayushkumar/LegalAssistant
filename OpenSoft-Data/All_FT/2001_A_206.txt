Heavy Engineering Corporation Limited v Anz Grindlays Bank
Supreme Court of India

29 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20302/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Our attention has been drawn to the direction of the single Judge, whereby the respondent was required to keep the money with itself but in a fixed deposit in the name of the petitioner, which would mean that in the event of the petitioner succeeding it would be entitled to interest.
2. Learned counsel states that the money was not to be paid to the petitioner but there was no valid reason for the High Court to have disturbed this direction.
Exemption allowed. Issue notice.
Order accordingly.
