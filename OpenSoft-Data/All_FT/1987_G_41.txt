Government of A. P. and Others v M. S. N. Murthy and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 October 1987
S.L.P. (Civil) Nos. 3877-77-A of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal rendered a decision in 1982 (R.P. Nos. 910 of 1977 and 1051 of 1978) by a three member Bench is regarded to employees of the State Government in the category of Junior Engineers and Assistant Engineers. In the absence of any challenge to the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal, it became final and the State became obliged to give effect to it in due course.
2. In 1984 a coordinate Bench of the Tribunal adopted a different view in regard to the same matter. A challenge has been raised against that decision and the matter is pending in this Court. The question that arises for consideration now is whether the decision of 1982, which became final, should or should not be implementation of the 1982 decision, we see no reason why implementation should be delayed.
3. After all the decision has become final and is binding on parties including the State Government. No contrary direction has been given by this Court in the other matter, which is still pending. In the circumstances, we do not want to entertain the special leave petitions and would like to reiterate that the decision of the Tribunal rendered in 1982 be enforced only subject to any other direction that may be given by this Court while disposing of the pending matter.
4. The State Government is directed to fully implement the order of 1982 as indicated above within a period of six months from today. We hope and trust that this order will be allowed to be implemented and no order may be made by any other court to restrain the implementation of this order.
Order accordingly.
