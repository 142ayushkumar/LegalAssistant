Supreme Court of India

19 April 2002
Cr.A. No. 526 of 2002 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 888 of 2002)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant was convicted under Sections 7, 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and awarded maximum sentence of two years' rigorous imprisonment and to pay fine of Rs. 2,000.
2. The appeal filed by him was admitted by the High Court but his bail application was rejected vide order impugned in this appeal.
3.  Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, that there is no likelihood of the appeal being heard in the near future and the factum that the sentence awarded is only two years, we feel that the High Court is not justified in refusing the bail application.
4.  We set aside the impugned order and direct that the appellant be released on bail on furnishing bail bonds to the satisfaction of the trial court. The amount of fine shall, however, be deposited vide the Judgment of the trial court.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
