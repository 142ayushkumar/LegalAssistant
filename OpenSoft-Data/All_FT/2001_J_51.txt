Jai Singh v Dalip Kaur
Supreme Court of India

23 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19284/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
We are not inclined to interfere with the matter.
1.  The Special Leave Petition is dismissed. After we dismissed the matter, learned counsel for the petitioner stated that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises immediately, it shall create great hardship to him. Therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is justified.
2. We, therefore, grant time till 30.6.2002 to the petitioner to vacate the premises on his filing usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from today.
3.  In case the landlord has any objection to this part of the order, it shall be open to her to apply for vacation of this order.
Petition dismissed.
