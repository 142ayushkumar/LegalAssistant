Alankar Commercial Private Limited v Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

6 December 1999
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 17435 of 1999
The Judgment was delivered by: B N KIRPAL, J.
1.  It is contended that Sikkim was not a part of India and at that time the Income-Tax Act was not applicable in respect of the assessment year for which notice was served at New Delhi. Learned counsel for the petitioner relies upon the decision of this Court in State of Sikkim vs. Surendra Prasad Sharma 1994 Indlaw SC 1493.
2.  The aforesaid decision in Surendra Prasad Sharma's case (supra), related to the employees employed in a company in Sikkim and the question which arose there was whether the Indian law applied or not. The question of applicability of the Income-Tax Act did not arise in that case, therefore, the said decision has no relevance. The Indian IT Act, inter alia, taxes income which accrues or arises in India.
3. It is immaterial whether the petitioner company has its head office in Sikkim or may be carrying on business activities there. The impugned notice under s. 148 of the IT Act has been issued in relation to the income which is stated to have arisen in India and this can be done even if the petitioner has a company registered in Sikkim. The decision of the High Court calls for no interference.
The petition for special leave is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
