Rangnath Misra v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

9 April 2001
W.P. (C) No. 239 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, it appears that the following questions may also fall for decision in the writ petition, besides other questions:
(1) Whether legally obliging the singing of national anthem in an assembly by all those present in the assembly when the national anthem is sung is unconstitutional?
(2) Does the judgment in Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala 1986 Indlaw SC 626 require reconsideration?
2.  The writ petition is, therefore, required to be heard by a Constitution Bench.
3. We, accordingly, refer the writ petition to be heard by a Constitution Bench. Keeping in view the importance of the issues, it is desirable that the writ petition is heard at an early date.
4.  Let the papers be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for constitution of the Bench.
Order accordingly.
