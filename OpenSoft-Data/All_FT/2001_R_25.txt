Kanraj C. Shah v R. Thankaraj and Anr
Supreme Court of India

23 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11114/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard counsel for the parties.
1. The appellant herein filed a suit for declaration and injunction. Subsequently, the defendant-respondents moved an application for amendment of written statement filed by them. The said amendment application was allowed. In view of the said amendment, the plaintiff-appellant also moved an application for amendment of the plaint by incorporating therein that the unregistered sale deed is invalid. The said application was rejected by the trial court. A revision against the said order filed before the High Court was dismissed.
2.  However, the High Court permitted the plaintiff-appellant to lead evidence on the question of invalidity of the unregistered sale deed.
3.  After we heard the matter, we find that, in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, the court was not justified in refusing to permit the plaintiff-appellant to amend the plaint. We, therefore, set aside the order under challenge and permit the plaintiff-appellant to amend the plaint. Accordingly, the application for amendment is allowed. However, it would be open to the defendant-respondents to raise any contention borne out from the written statement before the trial Court.
The appeal is allowed. No costs.
Appeal Allowed.
