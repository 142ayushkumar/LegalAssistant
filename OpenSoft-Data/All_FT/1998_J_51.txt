Jyotsna Suri v Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and others
Supreme Court of India

16 October 1998
C.As. No. 5185 of 1998 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 7897 of 1998) with Nos. 5186-88 of 1998 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 7898-99 and 7949 of 1998)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The Tribunal has disposed of the appeal by its order of 3-1-1997, without considering the pending application under Rule 29, of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Rules, 1963 for adducing additional evidence.
2. Obviously, that application was required to be disposed of first before the Tribunal heard the appeal on merits. The appellant also undertakes to withdraw the pending application before the Tribunal for making a reference under Section 256(1), of the Income Tax Act for the above purpose.
3.  In this view thereof, we direct that the Tribunal should first dispose of the application under Rule 29, on merits and thereafter proceed to dispose of the appeal on merits. The order of 3-1-1997, is, therefore, set aside and the matter is remitted to the Tribunal for disposal on merit in accordance with law.
4. The order of the High Court is set aside as above and the appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
