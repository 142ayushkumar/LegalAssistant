1. Leave granted.
2. Having heard the learned counsel on both sides, we are of the view that the petition now pending before the Family Court should be finally disposed of. Accordingly, we direct the Family Court, Attingal to dispose of O.P. (G & W) No. 450 of 2017 expeditiously and preferably within a period of six months.

4. In view of this Judgment now passed, nothing survives in OP (FC) No. 346 of 2017 pending before the High Court of Kerala and it is, accordingly, disposed of.
5. We make it clear that the Family Court will try and dispose of the petition uninfluenced by any of the observations and findings, either by the Family Court in the interim order or by the High Court or by this Court.
6. With the above observations and directions, this appeal is disposed of.
7. The Registry shall communicate a copy of this Judgment to the High Court of Kerala as well as to the Family Court at Attingal forthwith.
