Ashwani Kumar (Dead) By Lrs. v Durga Trading Company
Supreme Court of India

25 February 2005
C.A. No. 1413 of 2005 (Arising out of SEP (C) No. 17421 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The order of eviction passed in favour of the appellant was affirmed in first appeal being Rent Appeal No. 142 of 2003. On the said appeal having been dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge, Karnal, exercising powers of the appellate authority under the Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, the order of the Rent Controller dated 31-3-2003 and the appellate order dated 1-3-2004 were challenged by the respondent tenant in Civil Revision No. 1646 of 2004 filed under Section 15(6) of the aforesaid Act.
2. The High Court, by the impugned judgment and order, without going into the merits, setting aside the order of the appellate court on application for production of additional evidence, has remitted Rent Appeal No. 142 of 2003 for its fresh decision by the appellate authority.
3.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. A perusal of the order of the appellate authority shows that the documents sought to be produced by the respondent tenant at the appeal stage were considered by the appellate authority and were not found to be relevant.
4. The High Court, without examining those documents by merely setting aside the order passed on the application, which is part of the main order of disposal of appeal, has remitted the appeal for fresh decision as aforenoted.
5.  In our view, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, proper course to be adopted was to hear the parties on merits including their submissions on those documents as also relevancy thereof and decide the revision petition in accordance with law instead of remitting the appeal for fresh decision.
6. In this view, we set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court and remand Civil Revision No. 1646 of 2004 for its fresh decision expeditiously. It would be open to the High Court to consider, in accordance with law, the documents which were sought to be produced before the appellate authority, the relevancy thereof while deciding the revision petition.
7.  The appeal is allowed in above terms. During the pendency of the revision petition, the status quo as to possession shall be maintained.
Appeal allowed.
