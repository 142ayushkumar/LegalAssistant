Balwant Singh and Others v Amarjit Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8643-8645/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  After the trial Court disposed of the matter ex-parte an application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC was filed and the same was allowed.
2. Thereafter the matter was carried in revision to the High Court and the High Court interfered with the same stating that the exercise of jurisdiction is improper. Having considered the matter in its totality, we think the High Court was not justified in interfering with the order.
3.  Therefore, the order made by the High Court is set aside restoring the order of the trial Court, so that the proceedings in the suit stand restored to the original file.
The appeals are allowed accordingly.
Appeals allowed.
