State of Uttar Pradesh v Virendra Kumar Srivastava and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Civil) No.17047-17048/2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
S.P.(C) NO.17048 OF 2002:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel on either side.
1.  The Division Bench has chosen to reject Special Appeal No.258 of 2000 on the ground that the inordinate delay of 1 year and 185 days has not been properly explained to warrant condonation.
2.  On going through the materials on record and the issues involved for consideration, we find that substantial questions have got to be adjudicated on the pleadings and the High Court, instead of merely dismissing the appeal on the ground of delay, could have reasonably considered the question of condonation, subject to certain terms. Keeping in view all these aspects, the case on hand, in our view deserves condonation of delay to facilitate the disposal of the appeal on merits.
3. We, consequently, direct the condonation of delay in filing Special Appeal No.258 of 2000 before the Division Bench of the High Court subject to the condition that the appellant-State will pay a sum of Rs.10,000/- as costs to respondent No.1 within six weeks from today. The said costs shall be paid to respondent No.1 by means of a demand draft to be delivered/sent by Registered post within the time stipulated. Consequently, the order of the High Court dated 15.01.2002 dismissing the Special Appeal on the question of delay is set aside and Special Appeal No.258 of 2000 is directed to be restored to its original file on proof of payment of costs ordered and the High Court shall dispose of the appeal afresh on merits and in accordance with law, after hearing both the parties and giving them due opportunities.
4.  The High Court may consider the expeditious disposal of the appeal at least within a period of six months from the date of receipt of copy of this order.
5.  The appeal is allowed and disposed of on the above terms. No costs.
S.P.(C) NO.17047 OF 2002:
6.  In the light of the above orders passed, the special leave petition filed directly against the judgment of the learned Single Judge is dismissed, since no separate orders need be passed thereon, in the light of the orders in the other appeal.
order accordingly.
