Bachan Kaur v U.O.I. and Anr
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner before us is an unfortunate widow of a Freedom Fighter. She made a claim for grant of pension under Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme, 1980. It appears such pension had been granted to the husband of the petitioner upto the year 1976 which was cancelled before his death but in what circumstances it was cancelled is not very clear.
2. It is therefore appropriate for the respondents to examine the case of the petitioner afresh and decide whether she is entittled for any pension and grant the same at least from the year 1997. Let this consideration be made within a period of four months from today.
3.  It is made clear that this Writ Petition, itself, be treated as an application made under the said Scheme. The Writ Petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
