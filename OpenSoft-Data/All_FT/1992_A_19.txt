Achhan Rizvi v State Of U.P.
Supreme Court of India

1 December 1992
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard counsel for all the parties.
1.  We have perused the substance of the report of the observer telephonically communicated to the Registrar General of this Court. The report was also shown to the learned counsel for all the parties.
2.  So far as the steps contemplated in the order dated 28-11-1992 are concerned, it may be appropriate and beneficial for the ensurement of the implementation of the undertaking given by the State Government that due publicity be given to the fact that the proposed 'Kar Seva'from 6-12- 1992 would not involve any construction activity or moving of any building material into the acquired land. Such publicity might inform all those concerned about the limitations of the purpose of gathering, if any, at the place. We direct both the Central Government and the State Government to issue appropriate publicity through such media as might seem appropriate including Doordarshan and All India Radio. This shall be done immediately.
