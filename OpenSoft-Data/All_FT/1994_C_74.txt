Burmah Shell Cooperative Housing Society Limited and Another v Chief Commissioner of Income Tax (Technical) New Delhi and Others
Supreme Court of India

16 March 1994
C.A. No. 4171 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is a sequel to the proceedings initiated by the Income Tax Department under Chapter XX-C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act). The property in dispute was auctioned by the Income Tax Department and the same was purchased by a non-resident Indian. The owner of the house was a member of the appellant-housing society and the plot was allotted to him as a member of the said society.
2.   It is not disputed that the auction-purchaser is neither a member of the society nor resident of Delhi. The appellant-society challenged the auction-sale by the Income Tax Department on the ground that under the byelaws of the society the sale could only be made to a resident of Delhi who was not owning any other property. The High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that the provisions of the Act have overriding effect on the bye-laws of the society.
3.  We see no ground to interfere with the view taken by the High Court. The appeal is dismissed. No. costs.
Appeal dismissed.
