State of Andhra Pradesh and Another v Obulu Reddy
Supreme Court of India

1 September 1999
C.A. No. 7246 of 1993 with C.A. Nos. 658/94, 4650/98 & 207/99
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. These four appeals raise a common question on the interpretation of a certain G.O.M. issued by the State of Andhra Pradesh terms of which supposedly constitute an arbitration agreement. There is, however, apparent conflict on two decisions of this Court on the interpretation of the said G.O.M.
2. We take the facts in Civil Appeal No. 7246 of 1993 to understand the issue involved in these appeals.
3. Appellant, the State of Andhra Pradesh, awarded a contract on March 14, 1984 to the respondent for execution of certain work of construction or a canal across Sarada River. The value of the contract was over Rs. 83 lacs. G.O.M. No. 430 dated October 4, 1983 which contained arbitration clause was part of the contract document. This G.O.M. 430, in relevant part is as under:
------------------------------------------------------------------------- Value of Amount Panel of Arbitration ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Claims upto Rs. 10,000 & above. 2. Superintending Engineer of another Circle in the same Department.
3. Claims above Rs. 10, 000 upto 1. Another CE of the same Rs. 50,000. Department.
4. Where there is only one CE in the Department the CE, will submit proposals to Government in the Administrative Department for nomination of another CE as Arbitrator by Government.
5. Claims above Rs. 50, 000. Court of competent jurisdiction. -------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Disputes and differences having arisen of the value above Rs. 50,000/-, the respondent sent a letter to the Principal Subordinate Judge, Visakhapatnam to enter into the reference as Arbitrator. The Principal Subordinate Judge, however, declined to enter into any reference. Respondent then filed a petition u/s. 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 which was allowed by the Subordinate Judge on April 13, 1992 and the disputes were referred to a sole Arbitrator. State of Andhra Pradesh felt aggrieved and challenged the appointment of the Arbitrator by filing a Civil Revision in the Andhra Pradesh High Court. It was the contention of the State Government that under G.O.M. No. 430 claims above Rs. 50, 000/- could only be decided in a regular suit and it could not be the subject matter of arbitration and that S. 8 of the Arbitration Act was inapplicable.
High Court, however, dismissed the revision filed by the State Government by its judgment and order dated November 23, 1902. State Government has been taken the matter of this Court in appeal after obtaining leave. In the meanwhile, it appears, another G.O. No. 160 dated June 1, 1987 was issued by the State Government clarifying if claim over Rs. 50, 000/- is to be decided by the Arbitrator by a Civil Court. This G.O. we set down as under:
"Order
(1) Govt., after careful consideration of various aspects, issued orders in para (2) of the G.O. read above prescribing the revised procedure for arbitration
(2) It has come to the notice of the Government, that some of the contractors are approaching Courts to decide that claims above Rs. 50,000/- under the provisions of the Arbitration Act taking advantage of para 2(3) of the G.O. read above. The intention of the Government incor-porating the above provision is to dispense with the Arbitration proceedings in respect of claims above Rs. 50,000/- and leave the parties to have their remedy in Civil Court. As some of the contractors have misconstrued that the claims above Rs. 50,000/- have to be decided under the Arbitration Act and not under ordinary Law in a regular Civil Court, the Government, direct that the following amendments to G.O.Ms. No. 430, I (Irr. V) Department dated 24-10-1983 be issued by way of clarification.
(i) Item (3) of para (2) may be deleted
(ii) Substitute para (3) by the following"
(iii) Paras 3 to 7 are renumbered as paras 4 to 8."
5. As to how the conflict has arisen, we refer to the two decisions of this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh v. I. Devender Reddy, and in Vishakhapatnam Urban Development Authority v. V. Narayana Raju. In both the decisions reference was made to G.O.M. No. 430 and G.O.M. No. 160 and this is how the Court understood these two G.O.Ms:
(1) State of Andhra Pradesh v. I. Devender Reddy (supra), u/s. 8(2) of the Arbitration Act, Subordinate Judge, Paddapalli at the instance of the respondent appointed an Arbitrator to give an award in respect of the dispute relating to the execution of a work contract. The appeal against the said order has been dismissed by the High Court in limine. The State has now appealed to this Court challenging the order appointing the ArbitratorMr. Nambiar, learned counsel for the State has relied upon two Government notifications dated 24th October, 1983 and 1st June, 1987 in support of his contention that the dispute cannot be decided by the Arbitrator but must be determined by a Civil Court in a properly constituted suit. We have perused the terms of the notifications. The first notification dated 24th October, 1983 is not precise in terms as to the forum of adjudication of claims above Rs. 50,000/- but the second notification dated 1st June, 1987 expressly provides that all claims above Rs. 50,000/- shall be decided by the Civil Court of competent jurisdiction by way of a regular suit. It first notification was clear enough as to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to decide all claims above Rs. 50,000/- it was unnecessary to issue the second notification substituting the uncertainty in para 3 of the first notification. It is not in dispute that the second notification is only prospective and apparently not applicable to the case on hand since the claim in question arises out of the contract dated 4th March, 1986."
(2) Vishakhapatnam Urban Development Authority v. V. Narayana Raju (supra). Having perused G.O.Ms. No. 430 dated 24th October 1983 we have no doubt that it clearly provides for arbitration in respect of claims only upto Rs. 50,000/- and not above that amount making it clear in paragraph 2 that the claims above Rs. 50,000/- are to be adjudicated by the Court of competent jurisdiction. No doubt the expression "Court of competent jurisdiction" is mentioned under the head "panel of arbitrators" since the same para deals with "claims upto Rs. 10,000/- and upto Rs. 50,000/-." That is, however, in inartistic drafting of the G.O.Ms. but it cannot be construed to mean that claims above Rs. 50,000/- are to be adjudicated by arbitration in which the judge presiding over the Court of competent jurisdiction is to act as the Arbitrator. It would be absurd to make such a construction of that part of the G.O.Ms. which would oblige the Judge to act as the Arbitrator. The subsequent G.O.Ms. No. 160 dated 1-6-1987 merely clarifies this fact on account of an attempt by some contractors to misconstrue the earlier G.O.Ms. as clearly stated in the subsequent G.O.Ms. The contention of the respondent is wholly untenableConsequently, the appeals are allowed. The impugned orders made by the High Court and the trial Court are set aside resulting in rejection of the respondent's applications made u/s. 8 of the Arbitration Act."
6. It will, thus, be seen that in I. Devender Reddy's case G.O.M. 160 has held to be prospective in operation and the appeal of the State Government seeking removal of Arbitrator appointed u/s. 8(2) of the Arbitration Act was dismissed.
In the case of V. Narayana Raju this Court said that G.O.M. 160 was only clarificatory in nature and it allowed the appeal of Vishakhapata Urban Development Authority, it would appear that the decisions I. Devender Reddy's case was not cited before the Court in the case of V. Narayana Raju. In any case, there is apparent conflict in these two decision which has to be resolved by a larger Bench.
7. We, therefore, direct that these appeals be laid before Hon'ble the Chief justice for him to constitute a larger Bench in order to decide if G.O. 160 dated June 1, 1987 is merely of clarificatory nature or of prospective operation.
Order accordingly.
