Ram Katori and Another v Laiq Singh and Another
Supreme Court of India

25 November 1997
The Judgment was delivered by : G. T. Nanavati, J.
1. Ram Katori, widow of the deceased and his brother Rajiv Singh who was the original informant have filed this appeal against the acquittal of Laiq singh respondent No.1. The High Court considered the evidence of 3 eye witnesses and found that none of them was a reliable witness. The High Court has given good reasons for not placing reliance upon any of those witnesses. We have carefully gone through the evidence and we find that their evidence suffers from major infirmities as pointed out by the High Court. We are, therefore of the opinion that no interference is called for by this court.
The appeal is, therefores, dismissed
