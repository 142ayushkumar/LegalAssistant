National Insurance Company Limited v Ram Kali and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 January 2004
Appeal (Civil) 9065 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This Special Leave Petition is directed against a judgment and order dated 20th December, 2002 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh whereby and where under the appeal filed by the petitioner herein questioning an award dated 6-9-2002 made by Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Fatehabad was dismissed. The High Court has dismissed the aforementioned appeal inter alia on the ground that the driving license of the offending vehicle had been found to be fake. The learned Tribunal, however, arrived at the finding of fact that the first respondent herein has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy by plying the Maruti Van on hire/reward at the time of accident.
2.  The said question, it appears from the impugned judgment of the High Court, was not adverted to before it.
3.  In view of the fact that both the Tribunal and the High Court had exercised then discretion in favour of the claimant. We do not intend to exercise our discretional) jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, this petition is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
