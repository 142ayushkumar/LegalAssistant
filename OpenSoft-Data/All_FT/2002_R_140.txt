The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, in our view, the impugned order passed by the High Court in Criminal Rivision No.264 of 2001 quashing the charge framed under Sections 302 and 201 by the Sessions Court cannot be justified. There is prima facie evidence on record and, therefore, the trial court was justified in framing the charge.
2. In the result, this appeal is allowed and the impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. The trial court to proceed with in accordance with law and pass appropriate orders after recording the evidence.
