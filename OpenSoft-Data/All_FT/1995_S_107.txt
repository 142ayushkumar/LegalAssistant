Leave granted.
1.  These appeals by special leave arise from the order dated August 8, 1991 of the Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court directing the reinstatement of the first respondent pending the criminal prosecution. Since it is now admitted across the Bar that the first respondent had been discharged by the Criminal Court for want of proper sanction, he was reinstated in the service in January, 1988. Consequently, he is entitled to full salary and allowances for the period during which he was kept under suspension.
The appeals are accordingly disposed of. No costs.
