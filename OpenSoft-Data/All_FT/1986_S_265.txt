Chemicals and Plastics India Limited and Another v State of Tamil Nadu and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 October 1986
Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 25037 of 1986
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Issue notice on the civil miscellaneous petition returnable on October 16, 1986. Pending notice the amount of excise duty recovered by the State of Tamil Nadu on the alcohol used by the manufacturer as PVC resin will be kept separately so that ultimately equities can be adjusted.
2.   Meanwhile, whatever clearance of the alcohol is made by the petitioner, will be as per the record maintained by the Excise Department and no excise duty be recovered on it by the Central Government since it is being recovered by the State of Tamil Nadu.
3.  Also issue notice on the application for stay to the Union of India.
Order accordingly.
