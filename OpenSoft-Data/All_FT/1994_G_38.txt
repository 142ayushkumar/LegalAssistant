P. Nageswara Rao and Others v Government of A. P. and Another
Supreme Court of India

31 January 1994
C.A. Nos. ... of 1994 (Arising out of (C) Nos. 12797-99 and 13290-91 and 14750 of 1993)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  Heard learned counsel. These appeals arise from the Common judgment dated 30-7-1993 of a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Writ Petition No. 6901 and connected writ petitions including Writ Petition No. 6637 of 1993.The Government of Andhra Pradesh, exercising its power under Section 3 of the Andhra Pradesh Motor Vehicles Taxation Act (Amendment Act 11 of 1992), for short 'the Act', imposed taxes on stage carriages and contract carriages at varied rates through GOMs No. 75, dated 27-4- 1993.The impost was upheld by the said common judgment. SLP No. 13086 of 1993 filed by one of the writ petitioners, aggrieved against the said common judgment of the High Court, when came up for hearing on 3-9-1993beforethis Bench, we dismissed it after hearing the counsel. When the present SLPs directed against the same judgment of the High Court were placed before another Bench of this Court, they were ordered to be posted before this Bench for disposal. Thus these SLP's have come up before us for preliminary hearing.
2.  The only argument which was not advanced before us when we dismissed the SLP earlier but which has now impressed us is that of the State Government lacking in power under the Act to issue the notification to collect the tax from a retrospective date, namely, 1-4-1993, even though that notification was made effective only from 27-4-1993. We shall consider and decide the argument, which relates to competence of the State Government.
3.  Admittedly, the notification dated 27-4-1993contained in the aforesaid GO expressly mentions that the tax imposed would be effective on and from 27-4-1993. Therefore, the Government in issuing the GO imposing tax liability on the stage carriages or contract carriages, of paying enhanced rates as quarterly tax, has made the order effective from 27-4-1993. Though Shri Sitaramiah, the learned Senior Counsel for the State, contended that in normal practice the quarter begins from 1-4-1993 and the High Court, therefore, had rightly held that the order would be effective from 1-4-1993, we find it difficult to accede to that contention. When the Government order itself expressly mentions that the liability to pay the tax operates on and from 27-4-1993, its operation cannot be prepared to an earlier date by placing such construction on the order.
4. The High Court, therefore, was not right in its conclusion that the liability to pay enhanced motor vehicles tax commenced from 1-4-1993, inasmuch as the GO cannot be construed as having given retrospective operation to it. In fact, retrospective effect could not have been given by the State Government to the notification as it was not vested with such power. Hence, the common judgment of the High Court under the present appeals has to be held to be bad to the limited extent, it has said that the tax imposed under the notification impugned before it was liable to be paid from a date prior to 274-1993. The appeals are, therefore, allowed to the said limited extent only, while the common judgment of the High Court in other respects stands undisturbed.
Appeal allowed
