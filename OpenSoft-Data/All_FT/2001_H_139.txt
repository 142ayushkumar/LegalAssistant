Hussain Ghariyali Mohd. Husain and Others v State of Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1229/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard Mr. U.R. Lalit, the learned senior counsel appearing for the accused persons and Ms. H. Wahi, the learned counsel for the State of Gujarat.
2.  These two applications are being filed by the accused persons, who are facing trial before the Designated Judge, TADA. Mr. U.R. Lalit, the learned senior counsel appearing for the accused persons contends that when the matter was listed earlier on 11th August, 2000, the Court itself on consideration of the submission made by the parties had reached a conclusion that the trial should be finished within 2 or 3 weeks, therefore did not grant the bail. But notwithstanding several months have elapsed in the meantime, there has not been much progress in the matter, and therefore the appellants should be released on bail. We find sufficient force in the aforesaid contention.
3. We therefore allow these appeals and direct that the appellants be released on bail to the satisfaction of the learned Designated Judge, Surat, subject to the condition as the Designated Judge thinks proper.
The appeals are disposed of.
Appeals Disposed of.
