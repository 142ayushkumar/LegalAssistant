Ram Prakash v U. P. Public Services Tribunal-Ii Lucknow and Others
Supreme Court of India

3  May  1984
C.A. No. 2453 of 1984 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 3 December 1980 of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Misc. Writ No. 5733 of 1980).
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Special leave granted.
1.  A peon formerly in employ of Nagar Palika, Kasganj is being pushed from pillar to post from 1967 and till today in search of justice and if we adopt the strict legal modality, even if he succeeds a remand is inevitable. Thereby this old litigation will get a new lease for decades multiplying the misery of the appellant.
2.   The beneficiary of remand order will certainly be someone other than the appellant. Mr C. P. Lal, learned counsel for the appellant stated that the appellant is so exhausted that he is willing to forgo his claim to reinstatement and backwages for 17 years, if he is adequately compensated.
3.   Respondents 2 and 3, Nagar Palika and its Executive Officer respectively frankly stated that the Court may accept the suggestion, determine reasonable compensation to be paid by the respondents 2 and 3 to the appellant.
4.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case we direct the respondent-Nagar Palika, Kasganj shall pay Rs 30, 000 in lump sum to the appellant within two months from today in full and final settlement of his claims including reinstatement or compensation in lieu thereof and all terminal benefits.
5.  The appeal is allowed to the extent herein indicated with no order as to costs.
Appeal Allowed.
