Kohinoor Tarpaulin Industries v National Insurance Company Limited
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2003
C.A. No. 8400 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the appellant.
1.  This appeal is directed against the order dated 9th August, 2001 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short, 'the National Commission') on a complaint made before it on 23rd February, 2000 seeking damages of Rs. 36, 12, 471/- from the Insurance Company on account of loss sustained by fire in the factory of the appellant on 22nd March, 1987. The National Commission dismissed the complaint on the ground that it was barred by time.
2. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that there was a continuing cause of action for the appellant to file the complaint before the National Commission. When asked as to why inordinate delay in approaching the National Commission of almost more than thirteen years has occurred, the learned counsel submitted that at the time when fire took place in the factory, no consumer forum was available and, therefore, the appellant had filed a civil suit; subsequently, the civil suit was withdrawn.
3.  In our view, the impugned order is rightly passed by the National Commission holding that the complaint was clearly barred by time. When cause of action arose for the appellant to file the suit, at least from that date the complaint ought to have been filed within two years. If the remedy was not available to approach the consumer forum at the relevant period, the appellant should have continued his efforts to get the claim settled in the civil suit.
4.  Under the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed, being devoid of merits. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
