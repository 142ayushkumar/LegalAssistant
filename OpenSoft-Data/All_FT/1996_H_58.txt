Haryana Urban Development Authority and another v Anupama Patnaik
Supreme Court of India

4 October 1996
C.A. No. 12773 of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 14466 of 1996)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard counsel for the parties.
Special leave granted.
1.  It is rather strange that a simple claim tor money was made in a writ petition and was entertained by the High Court and allowed. There are several disputed questions of fact.
2. Each party is alleging that the other party is guilty of violation of the terms of the allotment. The matter is not covered by any statutory provisions. The writ petition itself was misconceived and not ought to have been entertained.
3.  Accordingly, this appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court is set aside. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
