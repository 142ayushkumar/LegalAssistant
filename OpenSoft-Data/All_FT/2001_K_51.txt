K.K. Sharma v State Th. Secretary Home Deptt. and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1979/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court rejecting the prayer of the petitioner to quash the F.I.R., on the ground that the F.I.R. does not make out any offence under Sections 39 and 44 of the Indian Electricity Act.
2. In our view, the investigation need not be throttled by quashing the F.I.R. at this stage and, we are sure, that unless there are ample materials in course of investigation, question of filing a charge-sheet under Sections 39 and 44 of the Indian Electricity Act would not arise.
We, therefore, dismiss the special leave petition.
Petition dismissed.
