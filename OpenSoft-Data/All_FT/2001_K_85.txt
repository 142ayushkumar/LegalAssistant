Bimal Jyoti Gupta v Kalpana Gupta Kalpana Deb Choudhary
Supreme Court of India

23 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7460/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We find that the High Court has disposed of the first appeal as if it was disposing of a second appeal. No findings recorded by the trial court were discussed by the High Court both on evidence and law. It is required in law that first appellate court must appraise itself to the questions raised in the matter both on facts and law and after scrutinizing the same, it must record its findings. We find that the High Court has failed to consider as required in law while disposing of the first appeal. The impugned order is unsustainable.
2. We accordingly set aside the impugned order and remit the matter back to the High Court for deciding the same afresh. The High Court will decide the matter after giving opportunities to the counsel for the parties and dispose it of in accordance with law. There shall be no order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
