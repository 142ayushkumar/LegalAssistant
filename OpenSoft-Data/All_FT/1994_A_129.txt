Assam Forest Products Private Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

30 November 1994
C.A. No. 705 of 1977
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In view of the decision of this court in Phool Chand Bajrang Lal v. ITO 1993 Indlaw SC 1594, the plea raised herein by the assessee does not merit consideration. In view of the said decision, question No. 1 has necessarily to be answered against the assessee and in favour of the Revenue.
2.   We order accordingly. So far as question No. 2 is concerned, since it is merely an order of remand, it cannot be said to constitute a question of law which merits consideration by us. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
