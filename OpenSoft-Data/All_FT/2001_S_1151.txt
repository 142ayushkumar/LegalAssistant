Madras Pavement Traders Welfare Congress v State of Tamil Nadu and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14603/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave is granted. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Leave is granted limited to the question as to why the appellant should not be permitted to approach the Committee referred to in the order of this Court in SLP(C) Nos.22689-22690/97 dated December 7, 1998.
2.  The appellant and its members are carrying on sundry business on the pavement of the roads in Chennai. In response to the limited notice, the respondent filed counter affidavit stating, inter alia,
" III. The petitioners are at liberty to approach the Hawking Zone Committee for appropriate reliefs and if their claims are genuine and bonafide the Hawking Zone Committee might explore the possibility of providing alternative place to the petitioners. As such, the question of providing alternative place does not arise at this stage.
I submit that in view of the preliminary submissions that the Petitioner Association is at liberty to approach the Hawking Zone Committee, which has been constituted pursuant to the orders of this Hon'ble Court, for appropriate reliefs, the question of providing alternative place during the pendency of the Special Leave Petition does not arise."
3.  In view of these averments in the counter affidavit the learned counsel for the appellant submits that he has nothing further to claim in this appeal. Accordingly, the appellant and its members will be entitled to approach the Committee and make representation for its consideration.
4. With this observation, the appeal is disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
