Raj Kishore Makani v Vidya Sagar (Dead) through Lrs and others
Supreme Court of India

15 February 2017
Civil Appeal No(s). 5839 of 2005
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. The appellant-tenant has challenged the order dated 29.01.2004 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Civil Revision No. 490 of 2004.
2. The High Court concurred with the concurrent findings recorded by the Rent Controller and the Appellate Authority and dismissed the Revision. Though the learned counsel made a persuasive attempt to say that there is perversity in the findings recorded by the Rent Controller, the Appellate Authority and the High Court, having gone through the materials available on record, we see no reason to take a different view, which is concurrently taken by all the three Forums. The bonafide requirement of the respondents is an undisturbed finding. There is also no basis for the challenge to their title. The clear finding is that the respondents had become owners of the premises.
3. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.
4. However, the appellant is granted time up to 31st December, 2017 to hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the premises in question to Respondent No. 1, who shall take possession for and on behalf of the other respondents, subject to filing the usual undertaking in this Court within a period of two weeks from today.
5. Towards use and occupation charges, the appellant shall pay Rs. 500/- (Rupees Five Hundred) per month with effect from March, 2017 to Respondent No. 1.
Pending interlocutory applications, if any, stand disposed of.
Appeal dismissed
