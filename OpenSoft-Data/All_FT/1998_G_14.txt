Commissioner of Sales-Tax v Ganesh Trading Company
Supreme Court of India

1 September 1998
C.A. No. 4585 of 1998 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 14656 of 1996), Dt. 1 September 1998.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The question which the High Court was required to consider reads thus:
"Whether under the facts and circumstances of the case the Board of Revenue was justified in holding that soyabean is covered under the terms and is included in Entry 1 of Part 5 of Schedule 2 of the Act and is liable to tax at the rate of 3 percent specially when it is covered under clause 4 of Entry 6 of clause 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act ?"
2. The High Court answered the question in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee. The State is in appeal by special leave.
3.  It is clear from a reading of the question as also the order of the Board of Revenue that the article to be taxed was soyabean and not soyabean husk. The decision of the Board of Revenue and the High Court in the case of General Foods Private Limited v. CST 1987 Indlaw MP 40, relating to soyabean husk could not have been applied to this matter. Soyabeans are oilseeds and are specifically covered by Entry 4 of Part IV of Schedule II to the M.P. General Sales Tax Act, 1958 and must be taxed accordingly.
4. The answer to the question is, therefore, answered in the negative and in favour of the Revenue.
Order on the appeal accordingly. No order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
