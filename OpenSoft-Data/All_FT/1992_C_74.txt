Supreme Court of India

20 November 1992
C.As. Nos. 2516 to 2518 of 1980 (Appeals by special leave against the judgment and order of the Bombay High Court in I.T.R. No. 152 of 1975.)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals arise out of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated July 30, 1976, in Income-tax Reference No. 152 of 1975 CIT v. Forbes Forbes Campbell and Co. Ltd. 1976 Indlaw MUM 3418 which related to the assessment years 1964-65, 1965-66 and 1966-67. The following two questions were referred to the High Court
"(1) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that the sums of Rs. 98,730 for the assessment year 1964-65, Rs. 1,10,000 for the assessment year 1965-66 and Rs. 81, 000 for the assessment year 1966-67, representing provision for gratuity were includible in computing the capital of the assessee- company under rule 1 of Schedule II of the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964, for the purpose of surtax ?
(2) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that the sums of Rs. 3, 20, 000 for the assessment year 1964-65, Rs. 3,48,943 for the assessment year 1965-66 and Rs. 4,62,609 for the assessment year 1966-67, representing dividend reserves were includible in computation of the capital of the assessee-company under rule 1 of Schedule II of the Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964, for the purpose of surtax ?"
2.  The High court answered question No. 1 in favour of the assessee and question No. 2 in favour of the Revenue. The appeals relate to question No. 1. Learned counsel for the respondent concedes that the matter is now covered by the decision of this court in Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. CIT 1981 Indlaw SC 391.
In view of the said decision, question No. 1 must also be answered in the negative. The appeals are, therefore, allowed and the order of the High Court is set aside, and question No. 1 is answered in the negative, i.e., in favour of the Department and against the assessee. There will be no orders as to costs.
Order accordingly.
