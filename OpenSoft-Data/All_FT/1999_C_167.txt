Commissioner of Income Tax v Gogineni Tobacco Limited
Supreme Court of India

15 July 1999
C.A. No. 3790 of 1999 (Arising as an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 16 October 1998, of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Income-tax Case No. 45 of 1998).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing counsel for the parties, in our opinion, the High Court was not correct in dismissing the application under section 256(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. A question of law does arise.
2.  We, therefore, allow the appeal and direct the Tribunal to state the case and refer the following question of law to the High Court :
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, benefit of section 80HHC can be claimed on the total income after deduction of unabsorbed losses and unabsorbed depreciation or otherwise ?"
Appeal allowed.
