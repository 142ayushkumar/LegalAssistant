C.A. No. 235 of 1983 with W.P. (Civil) No. 5259 of 1980 and C.A. Nos. 242 of 1990, 818 of 1992 and S.L.P. (C) No. 15641 of 1983 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 18 July 1980 of the Bombay High Court in Complaint (ULP)) No. 66 of 1978).
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. In view of the conflict between three three-Judge Bench decisions of this Court in May & Baker (India) Ltd. v. Workmen  1961 Indlaw SC 513, Western India Match Co. Ltd. v. Workmen  1973 Indlaw SC 315 and Burmah Shell Oil Storage & Distribution Co. of India v. Burmah Shell Management Staff Association  1970 Indlaw SC 301 on the one hand and later three three-Judge Bench decisions in S.K. Verma v. Mahesh Chandra  1983 Indlaw SC 70, Ved Prakash Gupta v. Delton Cable India (P) Ltd.  1984 Indlaw SC 58 and Arkal Govind Raj Rao v. Ciba Geigy of India Ltd., Bombay  1985 Indlaw SC 100 on the other, on the interpretation of Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and consequently the status of the medical/sales representatives prior to 6-3- 1976 when the Sales Promotion Employees (Conditions of Service) Act, 1976 was brought into force and also prior to 21-8-1984 when the definition of "workman" under the Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act was amended, we are of the view that propriety demands that the matter be heard by a larger Bench. We, therefore, refer the matter to a five- Judge Bench to be constituted by the learned Chief Justice of India for the purpose. These papers be placed before the learned Chief Justice for constituting the Bench.
Order accordingly.
