Food Corporation of India and Others v F. C. I. Paribahan Thikadhari Karmchari Samity and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 August 2000
Civil Appeal No. 5791 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, in our view, no case is made out for our interference in this appeal pursuant to the leave being granted under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.
2. The appellant-Food Corporation of India is directed by the Division Bench of the High Court, on compassionate ground, to regularise the services of 13 workmen who are found to have been working with it since years. Best of the workmen are already working with the State Government. The Division Bench in the impugned judgment on humanitarian ground, has directed that the 13 left out workmen may be absorbed in the appellant-corporation. This order being on humanitarian ground, obviously cannot be a precedent in other cases. All other consequential benefits flowing from the judgment under appeal will now be available to the concerned 13 workmen. The appeal is therefore, dismissed. Interim stay granted on 22.6.1997 will stand vacated. No costs.
Appeal dismissed
