Baby Naaz v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

9 February 1988
W.P. (Criminal) No. 721 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This writ petition arises out of an externment order dated February 25, 1984 passed by the competent authority against the petitioner. The petitioner had already suffered externment for 15 months out of 24 months' externment imposed by the impugned order when she approached this Court and obtained a stay order. On account of the said stay order granted by this Court, unexpired period of nine months has not been given effect to till now.
2. In view of the fact that about three years have elapsed meanwhile we direct that the impugned externment order insofar as the remaining period of 9 months is concerned shall not be enforced against the petitioner. The writ petition will stand disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
