Saurashtra Chemicals Ltd v Union Of India
Supreme Court of India

11  May  2000
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 8203-8212 of 2000, Dt. 11 May 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We see no reason whatsoever to entertain these special leave petitions. It is perfectly clear now that we have seen the provisions of the Act that the order of the Designated Authority is purely recommendatory. The appeal that lies is against the determination and that determination has to be made by the Central Government.
2. For this reason, we decline to exercise jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India and dismiss the special leave petitions.
Petitions dismissed.
