Soma Devi and Others v Raj Krishan Sharma
Supreme Court of India

18 February 1987
C.A. No. 2149 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The subject matter in dispute was a tenement on the first floor of a building in the walled city of Delhi. During the recent rains in August 1986 the building itself collapsed and it no longer exists. In view of the said development, the subject-matter having been destroyed, we find it difficult to grant any relief to the appellant.
2. We must mention that the High Court by its order dated October 29, 1962, in second appeal reversed the order of the Rent Control Tribunal, Delhi, as well as the Rent Controller and held that the respondent has proved his bona fide requirement under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958
3. All that we can do is to direct the respondent to waive all the arrears of rent and in addition to pay to the appellant a sum of Rs. 1000 within one month from today for the loss of her leasehold interest. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
