Satya Brat Gain v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

10 January 2000
Cr.A. No. 22 of 2000. .
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In the light of the report submitted by the trial Judge as well as by the Director General and I.G. Police, Patna (Bihar) we do not see any reasonable prospect of the trial against the appellant registering substantial progress in the future. It is already 5 years passed since appellant has been taken into custody in connection with this case. We are definitely not appreciating the reasons for this slow paced progress of the proceedings against the appellant. Be that as it may, we cannot permit the appellant to continue in incarceration for a further period without the adjudication being finalised.
2. We, therefore, order him to be released on bail on his executing a bond to the satisfaction of the trial Judge. We permit the trial Judge to impose such conditions as he feels necessary for ensuring his attendance on the dates of posting in the trial Court.
This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
