Bhaichandbhai Gandalal Soni and Others v Ratilal Gendalal Patdia Soni
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18573/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counel for the petitioner has pointed out error apparent in the order passed by the High Court to the effect that even though appeal from order is not disposed of, the High Court has passed the order in civil application in the pending appeal to the effect that the "interim relief granted is made absolute till disposal of the suit."
2.  Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the appeal from order is still to be decided, hence the impugned order passed by the High Court on the face of it, is illegal and erroneous. Considering the aforesaid submissions, in our view, this would be a fit case for the petitioner to approach the High Court by filing review application for appropriate order.
The special leave petition stands disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
