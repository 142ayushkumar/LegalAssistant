Sama China Narsa Reddy v State of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

23 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1969/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  At the time when notice was issued it was limited to the nature of offence. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that though deceased sustained some injuries on the head which consequentially caused intra crannial haemorrhage, he would not reasonably have anticipated that the blow inflicted by him would certainly have caused the said injury. In other words, learned counsel contended that the appellant cannot be credited with the definite intention to inflict the particular injury sustained. The said argument was addressed for the purpose of bringing down the offence from the "thirdly" clause of Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code.
2.  We find some force in the said contention, when we looked at the facts and the object used for beating the deceased. We, therefore, alter the conviction to Section 304 Part II of the Indian Penal Code. In the circumstances of this case a sentence of imprisonment for five years will be sufficient to meet the ends of justice.
By so altering the sentence correspondingly, we dispose of this appeal.
Appeal disposed of.
