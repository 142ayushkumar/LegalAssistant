1.  The petitioners in these two petitions who are liable to pay certain dues under the Employers Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 have questioned the validity of S. 279 and S. 281 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 under which it is open to the authorities to recover the dues as revenue arrears by resorting to the process of arrest and detention of the defaulter concerned.
2.  In Ram Narayan Agarwal v. State of U.P. 1983 Indlaw SC 551983 Indlaw SC 55 we have upheld the constitutional validity of the impugned provisions.We, therefore, dismiss these petitions.
3.  It is open to revenue authorities to recover the amounts due and payable by the petitioners by resorting to the process of arrest and detention in accordance with law and in the light of the judgment delivered in Ram Narayan Agarwal case 1983 Indlaw SC 551983 Indlaw SC 55. No costs.
Petition dismissed.
