Cargo Boat and Steel Barge P. Welfare Association and Another v State of Andhra Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 August 1997
C.A. No. 5512 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 5872 of 1997)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Leave granted.
2. The grievance of the appellants is that they have valid licences but the High Court has put a time period for utilising those licences. Therefore, the direction of the High Court that the old operators shall be permitted to continue their respective operations for a period of six months, by which period they shall replace their wooden barges by the steel barges of approved standard and in case such replacement is not done, the respondent-authorities shall be free to cancel licence/refuse permission for operating wooden barges, does not appear to be proper in the facts of this case.
3. So long as the appellants continue to hold the licences they are entitled to operate their barges. It is for the licensing authority to decide whether the licences will be cancelled or extended or revoked in accordance with law.
4. It is clarified that not only the appellants but whosoever applies for a licence will be dealt with in accordance with law by the Licensing Authority.
5. The appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
