K.Yarrappa Reddy v State of Karnataka
Supreme Court of India

29 August 2001
Review Petition(Cr.) No. 889/2001 in Cr.A.No. 263/1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is an inordinate delay of 580 days in filing this review petition. The explanation offered for condonation of delay is neither satisfactory nor reasonable. The application seeking condonation of delay is, therefore, rejected.
2.  Even otherwise, we have carefully gone through the review petition and its connected papers. We find no merit in the same.
The review petition is accordingly dismissed.
Review dismissed.
