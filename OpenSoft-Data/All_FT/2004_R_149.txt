Supreme Court of India

9 March 2004
W.Ps. (C) No. 754 of 1992 With No. 112 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On 15-4-1999 Ranganathan v. Union of India, 1999 Indlaw SC 1086 this Court made an order constituting an authority to examine the claims of those persons who were affected by the riots that took place as an offshoot of the Cauvery Water Dispute between the States of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
2. Certain retired District Judges were appointed to constitute the authorities who went into the details of nearly 10, 000 applicants, examined various aspects of the matter and came to the conclusion that certain amount of compensation should be paid to certain claimants while rejecting some of the claims. It is not in all cases that entire claim made by the applicants had been allowed. The authorities concerned have duly applied their mind to the relevant aspects in determining what compensation is to be paid.
3.  We consider that the work done by them is commendable and we are satisfied that the report filed by both the Tamil Nadu Cauvery Riots Relief Authority and the Karnataka Cauvery Riots Relief Authority should be accepted and there shall be order in terms of the said reports. Let the compensation be paid to the claimants by the respective States within a period of 6 months from today after due verification and after making due deductions of the payments already made.
The writ petitions are disposed of as aforesaid.
Petitions disposed of.
