S. K. Dheri v Mukesh Prakash
Supreme Court of India

11 December 2008
Civil Appeal No. 740 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant.
1.  By the impugned order, the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi [for short, "the Tribunal"] has convicted the appellant under Section 17 of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, read with Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one month. Hence, this appeal.
2.  Undisputedly, directions in the order dated 6th October, 1999, passed in O.A. No.983 of 1995 by the Tribunal have been complied with. In view of this, we are of the view that it would be just and expedient to set aside the impugned order.
3. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned order rendered by the Tribunal is set aside and the contempt proceeding initiated against the appellant is dropped.
Appeal allowed
