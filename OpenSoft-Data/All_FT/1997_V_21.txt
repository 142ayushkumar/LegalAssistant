Vee Kay Industries v Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi
Supreme Court of India

23 July 1997
C.As. No. 1820 of 1991 with No. 1619 of 1990
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the appellant M/s Vee Kay Industries submitted that a Special Bench of five members of Central Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT) has considered the same question and taken the view in favour of the assessee that elastic rail clips are classifiable under Item 26-AA(ia)/25(8) of the erstwhile Central Excise Tariff and not under Item 68. That decision of the Special Bench of the Tribunal is Sikka Heat Treatment Centre v. CCE.  1995 Indlaw CEGAT 983In that decision the two earlier decisions of the Tribunal by smaller Benches which have given rise to these appeals reported in Paxma Axle & Springs (P) Ltd. v. CCE 1989 Indlaw CEGAT 456 and Vee Kay Industries v. CCE 1990 Indlaw CEGAT 20213 have been overruled.
2.   The result therefore is that the judgments which are challenged in these appeals have already been overruled by a larger Bench of the Tribunal. That judgment was rendered on 24-6-1995. The learned Additional Solicitor General on instructions informs us that the Department has accepted the Tribunal's latter decision in Sikka Heat Treatment Centre and, therefore, the same has not been challenged before this Court.
3.  Apart from the fact that the Department itself has accepted the Tribunal's view taken in Sikka Heat Treatment Centre' we also find that this is the more appropriate view to take in the facts of the case. These appeals have, therefore, to be allowed.
4.  Consequently, these appeals are allowed. The impugned judgments of the Tribunal are set aside. No costs.
Appeals allowed.
