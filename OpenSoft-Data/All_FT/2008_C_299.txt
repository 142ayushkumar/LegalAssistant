Commissioner of Income-Tax v Oswal Agro Mills Limited
Supreme Court of India

1 February 2008
C.A. No. 909 of 2008 With C.A. No. 3170 of 2006
The Order of the Court was as follows :
In S. L. P. (C) No. 11507 of 2005:
1. Delay condoned.
2. Leave granted.
3. In this case, substantial question of law arose before the High Court under section 260 A of the  Income-tax Act,1961. The said question was as follows:
"Whether the assessee is entitled to deduction of Rs. 1,16,89,327 incurred as 'issue management expenses'?"
4. Reading the judgments of the Tribunal and the High Court, we find that the assessee has succeeded only on the basis of "rule of consistency". In our view, the High Court should have examined the nature of the said expenses, namely, "issue management expenses". In our view, substantial question of law did arise for determination.
5. Consequently, the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance with law.
6. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed.
7. No order as to costs.
In C. A. No. 3170 of 2006:
8. Following our above order in the appeal arising out of S. L. P. (C) No. 11507 of 2007, while setting aside the impugned judgment, we remit the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance with law.
9. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
10. No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
