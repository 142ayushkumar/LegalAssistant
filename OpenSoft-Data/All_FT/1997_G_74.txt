Laxmi Narain Sharma (Dead) By Lrs v Government of U. P. and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 January 1997
C.A. No. 1448 of 1981
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is no merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the appellant was deemed to have been automatically confirmed on expiry of the period of two years since the date of his appointment. Para 534 of the U.P. Police Regulation relied on by the learned counsel cannot be construed in that manner.
2. The provision clearly requires an order of confirmation if the appointee is considered fit for permanent appointment after expiry of the specified period. No such order of confirmation was issued in favour of the appellant. There is thus no foundation for such an argument
The appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
