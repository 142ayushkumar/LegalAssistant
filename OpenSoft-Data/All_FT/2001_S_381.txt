State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr v Sone Lal and Others
Supreme Court of India

16 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15123-15131/1999
The order of the Court was as follows:
Perused the Office Report.
1.  Issue notice on condonation of delay application and application for substitution.
2.  Inasmuch as the affidavit of service in regard to the Ist respondent Kamaljeet Singh was already filed by the learned counsel for the petitioner on 21.10.2000, therefore, the order of 20.4.2001 would not operate against the Ist respondent. However, the Ist respondent is not represented. The service may be treated as complete and the S.L.P. may be listed for final disposal in the normal course.
3. In the meanwhile, the Ist respondent may be represented by filing a fresh vakalatnama.
Order accordingly.
