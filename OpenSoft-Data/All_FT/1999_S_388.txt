Supreme Court of India

23 March 1999
C.As. Nos. 3978-91 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question raised in these appeals is squarely covered by the decision in State of Karnataka v. Subhash Rukmayya Guttedar 1992 Indlaw SC 1013.
2. In that case as in the present case the respondents are the contractors who are carrying on work for the benefit of the Karnataka Government. They were granted right to extract mines and minerals and remove them.
3.  The question is, whether such contractors were also liable to pay royalty in respect of quarrying such mines and minerals. This question is no longer res integra. The aforesaid decision covers this point and holds that such contractors are liable to pay the royalty.
4.  The High Court relied on the case of Subhash Rukmayya Guttedar v. State of Karnataka which itself has been overruled through the aforesaid judgment of this Court by setting aside the said judgment.
Accordingly, these appeals are allowed. No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
