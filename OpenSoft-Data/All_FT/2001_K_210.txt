Commissioner of Income Tax v Kodak India Limited
Supreme Court of India

17 October 2001
C.A. No. 6853 of 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The notice that was issued had stated that the matter appeared to be covered by the decision of this Court in Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. vs. CIT, 1996 Indlaw SC 16221996 Indlaw SC 1622 We find, now that we have heard learned counsel, that it is so covered.
2.  Learned counsel for the assessee stressed that in the instant case, the assessee had acted to increase its shares capital because it had been directed by the Reserve Bank of India so to do. This was because it had to reduce its non-residential holding to forty per cent.
3. It was learned counsel's submission that the only way in which the assessee could do business after the Reserve Bank directive was to issue share capital to comply with it.
In his submission, therefore, the decision of this Court in the case of Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (supra) was distinguishable.
4.  Whichever way we look at it, the object of the assessee was to increase its share capital; whether it did so to continue to do business after the Reserve Bank directive or otherwise, the case is covered by the judgment in the case of Punjab State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd.
5.  The appeal is, therefore, allowed and the order under appeal set aside. The question is answered in the negative and in favour of the Revenue. In other words, the expenditure of Rs. 8,07,624 incurred for the public issue of shares was capital expenditure.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
