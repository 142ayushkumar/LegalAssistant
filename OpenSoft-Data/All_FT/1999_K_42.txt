Kaderkunju and Another v Maheshwaran Pada Nair and Others
Supreme Court of India

12 April 1999
C.A. No. 2291 of 1999 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 4261 of 1998), Dt. 12 April 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ernakulam had calculated the compensation by applying the multiplier of ten. In the present case, considering that the son of the appellants who was a Mechanical Engineering student died in the accident at the age of 17 and the parents are aged only 47 years (father) and 45 years (mother), applying the multiplier of sixteen would be more reasonable.
2. Accordingly, we direct that a total compensation of Rs. 2,22,000/- be paid to the appellants together with interest @ 12% p.a. from the date of the petition till payment.
The civil appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
