1. In this civil appeal filed by the Department the question of law arises for determination which question is as follows:
"Whether interest paid in respect of borrowings on capital assets not put to use in the concerned financial year can be permitted as allowable deduction u/s. 36(1)(iii) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ?"
2. Our answer to the above-mentioned question is squarely covered by our decision in favour of the assessee and against the Department in the case of Dy. Commr. of Income Tax, Ahmedabad v. M/s. Core Health Care Ltd. in Civil Appeal Nos.3952-55 of 2002.
3. Accordingly the above question is answered in favour of assessee and against the Department. Consequently the Department's civil appeal is dismissed with no order as to cost.
Appeal dismissed.
