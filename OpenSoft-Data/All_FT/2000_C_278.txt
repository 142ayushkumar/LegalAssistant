The order of the court was as follows:
Delay is condoned.
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned Attorney General submits that two points arise in this appeal:
(1) whether the judgment of this Court in Union of India.Vs.Solar Pesticide Pvt. Ltd. covers this case and
(2) That the appellant has not passed on the burden of duty to the consumer and this question has not been gone into by the tribunal.
2. Learned Attorney General further submits that the point is squarely covered by the judgment of this Court in Solar Pesticides (Supra).
3.  In view of this the appellant is not entitled to the refund of the duty unless he proves that the burden has not been passed on to the consumer.
4. As this point has not been decided by the tribunal, we allow the appeal and remit the matter to the tribunal to decide whether the burden of duty has not been passed on by the respondent to the consumer. The tribunal will be at liberty to remand the case to the Assistant Collector to decide this question.
No costs.
Appeal allowed.
