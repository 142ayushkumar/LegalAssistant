Vardhaman v Balkrishna and Company
Supreme Court of India

13 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8314/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petition stated that the matter might be disposed of at this stage by an order setting aside the order under challenge and restoring the second appeal to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits.
2.  The High Court dismissed the second appeal summarily stating that it found no substantial question of law involved therein. Our attention has been drawn to the fact that counsel for the appellant had proposed before the High Court the following question:
"Whether the courts below erred in law in not granting the decree for eviction under Section 12(1)(c) and (F) of the MP Accommodation Control Act, 1961 ?"
3.  This is clearly a question of law that requires consideration. It is necessary, therefore, to pass an order in the terms suggested by the notice.
4. The civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The second appeal (S.A. No.412 of 1999) is restored to the file of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh (Indore Bench) to be heard and disposed of on merits.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
