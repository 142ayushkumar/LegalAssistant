Channabasava v C.A. Rohini and Another
Supreme Court of India

17 September 2001
C.A. ROHINI & ANR. Respondent (s)
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner in our view could not have maintained the writ appeal for the compensation or any other loss which he claims on account of the action taken by the respondent (writ petitioner) on the strength of the interim order passed by the High Court. Petitioner can have the remedy by moving the appropriate forum for it.
2. Hence, the impugned order will not be a bar for the petitioner to resort to any appropriate action for realising any compensation if he is entitled to it.
With these observations this Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
