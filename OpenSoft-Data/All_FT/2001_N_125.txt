D. Paul and Another v Nawab Ali Akhtar and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 January 2001
Cr.A. No. 74 of 2001 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 383 of 2000)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant was acquitted of offences under Sections 381 and 411 IPC and a revision petition filed by the respondents against the order of acquittal was dismissed by the High Court on 20-9-1999. After dismissing the revision petition, the High Court observed:
"It is stated that the departmental proceeding is pending against Opposite Parties 2 and 3. It goes without saying that the departmental proceeding will be disposed of on its own merit in accordance with law without being influenced by the order of acquittal in a criminal case."
2.  In our opinion, the above observations were not required to be made by the High Court while dismissing the revision petition. These observations shall, therefore, stand deleted.
3. We clarify that the question whether the order of acquittal can have any effect on the departmental proceedings or in the civil case will have to be decided at the appropriate stage by the appropriate forum.
The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
Appeal disposed of.
