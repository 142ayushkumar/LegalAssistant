Shiv Narain v State (N.C.T.) of Delhi
Supreme Court of India

5 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.)......./2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  The report has been received from the Registrar of the High Court of Delhi showing that Criminal Appeal No.330 of 1997 is already on the Board for final hearing. If that is so, we do not find any reason why the same could not be heard and disposed of within next three months. But learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he is not hopeful of the matter being disposed of within next 6 months in the way the things are moving in the Delhi High Court. We cannot subscribe to that view.
2. We dismiss this petition by permitting the petitioner to move the Delhi High Court for suspension of sentence of this petitioner in case the appeal No.330/97 is not heard within 6 months from today .
Petition dismissed.
