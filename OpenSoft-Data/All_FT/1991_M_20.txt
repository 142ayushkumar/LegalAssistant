Madan Lal and Others v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 October 1991
W.P. (Criminal) Nos. 143 to 668 of 1991 and 1341-1737 of 1990
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  From the submissions made by Mr Panjawani, learned counsel for the petitioners, it appears that some of the petitioners on whose behalf the present applications are being pressed have migrated from Punjab to Delhi following militant activities in Punjab. These migrants have not been recognised as bona fide and in fact their claim has already been scrutinised and negatived.
2.  Mr Panjawani now states that even if they are not rehabilitated in Delhi, the petitioners should be provided some rehabilitative facility either in the State of Punjab or outside Punjab. He says that if it is within Punjab the border districts which are disturbed should be avoided and the non-disturbed area of Punjab could be taken into account.
The petitioners should prefer however being rehabilitated in areas outside Punjab.
3.  Mr Mahajan for the Union of India has agreed that if a list of these people is provided to the Chief Secretary of Punjab within 3 weeks, their case would be considered in the routine manner in which such cases are being considered by the State Government of Punjab and the claim in the manner indicated above shall be looked into favourably.
4.  Petition for impleadment is allowed and the same is disposed of in the terms indicated.
This disposes of the present writ petitions.
Petitions disposed of.
