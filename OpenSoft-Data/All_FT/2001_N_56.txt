The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel for the respondent No.1 applicant and Shri A. Raghunath, learned counsel for the appellant.
2.  Shri Dwivedi submits that the applicant apprehends that the Family Court may be influenced by certain observations made in our order dated March 2, 2001. We are not satisfied that there is any basis for such apprehension. It goes without saying that any observation made in the order is only for the purpose of deciding the application for interim order.
With these observations, I.A.Nos. 9 to 10 are dismissed.
Applications dismissed.
