The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We have read the judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court under appeal, now reported in Dy. Commr. of Commercial Taxes v. Devendran and Co. 1980 Indlaw MAD 54.
2. We have heard learned counsel. We are satisfied that no interference is called for. Section 16(1)(b) applies only if assessment has been made at a rate lower than the assessable rate.
3. In the instant case, the assessment is not at a rate lower than that at which the turnover ought to have been assessed; it is really a case of seeking to reassess under a different head.
In the result, the civil appeals and the special leave petitions are dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
