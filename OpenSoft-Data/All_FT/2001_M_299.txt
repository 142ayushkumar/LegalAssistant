State of Haryana and Others v Messrs Bharat Singh Kamlesh Kumar and Anr
Supreme Court of India

9 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8701/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  Initially we thought that in order to protect the exchequer we should entertain this SLP, as the second respondent made an offer which is seemingly higher than the bid made by the first respondent. The order was initially passed by the Financial Commissioner(Revenue) of the Haryana State on the basis of the offer made by the second respondent. Though the High Court was not disposed to use the same as sufficient ground to upset the bid made by the first respondent, we wanted to have a re-look into the matter but the second respondent today entered appearance before us and said that he has withdrawn the offer made before the government. Both counsel for the respondents submitted that this resilement was not made on account of any understanding between them. We do not make any observation on the said stand of the respondents. Accordingly this SLP is dismissed.
2.  Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that he is not pressing this SLP. We do not know what prompted the petitioner to make the last minute withdrawal from the offer made by him. Standing counsel for the State requests that permission may be given to black-list the petitioner and take other actions against the petitioner. We do not make any observation on this aspect as it is for the State to adopt such measures as per law, if found necessary.
The SLPs are accordingly dismissed.
Petitions dimissed.
