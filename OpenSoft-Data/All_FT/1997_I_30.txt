Collector of Central Excise, Vadodara v Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited
Supreme Court of India

29 July 1997
C.A. No. 2923 of 1989 (Arising as an appeal form (46) E.L.T. 173 (Tribunal). See also 1990 (46) E.L.T. A73.)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The dispute is between the Revenue and a Public Sector Undertaking and the nature of the question for decision is such that it would arise only in respect of the liability of the Public Sector Undertaking for the payment of the duty. The course to be followed when the parties to the litigation of this kind has been indicated by this Court in Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. Collector of Central Excise - 1991 Indlaw SC 17  which has later been clarified with an order of the same time in Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. Collector of Central Excise - 1994 Indlaw SC 74.
2. In short, litigation of this kind between the Central Government and the Public Sector Undertaking is not to be resorted to without the matter being examined by a High powered Committee of Secretaries and with its clearance. This has not been done in the present case. The course indicated in these orders passed by this Court has to be adopted by the revenue.
3.  This appeal has, therefore, to be disposed of in terms of those orders. It is directed accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
