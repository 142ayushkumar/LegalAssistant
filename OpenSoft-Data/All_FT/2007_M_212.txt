Commissioner of Central Excise, Delhi-III v Maruti Udyog Limited
Supreme Court of India

5 January 2007
C.A. No. D12648 of 2006
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have perused the affidavit of Shri Hardeep Batra, Senior Technical Officer, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, filed on 21st December, 2006, giving explanation as to how this appeal against the order dated 16th April, 2004 passed by the Tribunal was filed when against this very order, appeal had been dismissed on 3rd July, 2006 on the ground that there was inordinate delay of 645 days in filing that appeal (Civil Appeal No. D7670/2006).
2.     In the affidavit, it is stated that the appeal was intended to be filed against the order dated 20th April, 2004, which is evident from a communication sent by the Central Agency on 1st December, 2006 but, inadvertantly, the approved draft civil appeal petition against the order dated 16th April, 2004, was annexed. The Department and the officer ought to have been careful. He ought to have known that the appeal had already been filed against order dated 16th April, 2004. Be that as it may, we permit this appeal to be withdrawn. It would be open to the Department to take such action against the officer and/or such steps against order dated 20th April, 2004, as it may be advised.
The civil appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
