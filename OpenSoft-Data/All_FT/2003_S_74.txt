State of West Bengal v Sarkar & Sarkar
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2003
Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 2092 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
Heard parties.
1.  These appeals are against the orders dated 26th August, 2002 and 26th September, 2002. The High Court has held that there is an arbitration agreement between the parties and has referred the matter to the learned Chief Justice for appointment of Arbitrator. Learned Chief Justice by his order dated 26th September, 2002, under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, (hereinafter called "The Act") 1996, has appointed an Arbitrator. This order is also assailed before us. This Court in the cases of Konkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. vs. Mehul Construction Co. reported in 2000 Indlaw SC 678 and Konkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. vs. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd., 2002 Indlaw SC 60, has held that the order passed by the Chief Justice is merely administrative in nature and cannot be challenged in a Special Leave Petition.
2. Further, Section 16 of the Act makes it clear that a party can take up the question of existence or validity of the arbitration agreement before the Arbitrator provided such a plea is not raised later than the submission of the statement of defence. Section 16 also provides that the party will not be precluded from raising such a plea merely because an Arbitrator has been appointed or the party has participated in the appointment of the Arbitrator.
3.  In our view the appellant must now take up the plea of non-existence of the arbitration agreement before the Arbitrator. We clarify that the observations made by the High Court in the orders dated 26th August, 2002 and 26th September, 2002 will be treated as prima facie observations not binding on the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator will decide objections taken on their own merits. Appeals stand disposed of accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
