State of West Bengal and others v Higher and State Audit and Accounts Services Assn. and others
Supreme Court of India

28 March 2000
C.A. No. 2218 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal is directed against the order made by the Administrative Tribunal by which an application filed by the respondents is disposed of directing payment of certain special pay. Perusal of the order will disclose that there is hardly any application of mind by the Tribunal to the relevant facts or law arising in this case. It is a very cryptic order and does not disclose any reason at all.
2. In the circumstances, we set aside the order made by the Tribunal and remit the matter to the Tribunal for fresh consideration in accordance with law.
3.  At this stage, learned counsel for the respondents brings to our notice that a review application has been filed against the impugned order in which contention has been raised that similar benefits should be extended to others. We do not express any opinion either on the merits of the application (TA No. 71 of 1996) filed by the respondents or on the review application. The appeal shall stand allowed accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
