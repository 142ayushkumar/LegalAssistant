Dr. Jainendrakumar Vijaykumar Badjate v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

22 January 1990
Cr.A. No. 32 of 1990 (arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 1288 of 1989)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted. Counsel heard.
1.  We find that Criminal Appeal No. 25 of 1986 has been decided without the learned Counsel of the appellant (accused) who was appointed by the Court not being present.
We do not wish to enter into the question as to why the counsel was not present. That is a matter which can be considered by appropriate authorities, if they think fit.
2. In the circumstances, however, we set aside the judgment of the High Court and direct that the Criminal Appeal No. 25 of 1986 shall be heard afresh by the High Court. The appellant states that he will engage his own counsel at his own cost.
3.  The appeal is allowed as aforesaid with no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
