First Land Acquisition Collector and Others v Nirodhi Prakash Ganguli and Anr
Supreme Court of India

8  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9958/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  It appears that the impugned judgment has not been annexed to the petition in full. As a matter of fact the main operative portion of the judgment is missing from the judgment. This is neither fair nor proper.
2. Therefore, we are not inclined to entertain this special leave petition. It is dismissed accordingly. This order, however, will not prejudice the rights of the State Government to move afresh before this Court on the same cause of action with a corrected and complete copy of the judgment.
Petition dismissed.
