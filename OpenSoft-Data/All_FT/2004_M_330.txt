Vinod Das v Mukesh Prasad and Another
Supreme Court of India

16 July 2004
C.A.No. 8126 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are satisfied that the impugned judgment dated 23.3.2003 passed by the Bar Council of India has to be set aside and the matter remanded for re-hearing and decision afresh, inasmuch as we are of the opinion that the principles of natural justice have been breached.
2.  It is not disputed that the appellant, i.e. the advocate, proceeded against in disciplinary proceedings, was confined in jail at Hoshangabad at the time when the Bar Council of India heard the case and pronounced its judgment. The wife of the appellant moved an application for adjournment which was not allowed.
3. As the professional career of the appellant was at stake, we are of the opinion that the
"Bar Council of India ought not to have formed an opinion against the appellant without affording the appellant an opportunity of hearing".
4.  The impugned judgment is set aside. The case is remanded to the Bar council of India which shall afford the appellant an opportunity of hearing and making his submissions before it and thereafter a decision afresh shall be taken by the Bar Council of India and communicated to the parties.
5.  The appeal stands disposed of in the above-said terms. No order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
