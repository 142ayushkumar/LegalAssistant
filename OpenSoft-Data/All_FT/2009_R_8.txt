Ghaziabad Development Authority v (1) Rishi Lal Chawla; (2) Kanti Prasad Rajvanshi
Supreme Court of India

30 April 2009
Civil Appeal No. 7986 of 2002 with Civil Appeal Nos. 7983-7984 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  The matters were called out for hearing yesterday when a request for adjournment was made by the counsel appearing for Ms. Reena Singh, Advocate on the ground that she was in personal difficulty. The request for adjournment was declined but the matter was passed over to enable the counsel to inform Ms. Singh about our order. Somehow the matters could not be taken up yesterday and have now been called out for hearing. Again the same counsel makes prayer for adjournment.
2. We have declined the prayer. We have requested the counsel to argue, but he has expressed his inability to do so. Under the circumstances we have no option but to dismiss the appeals for non-prosecution.
Ordered accordingly.
