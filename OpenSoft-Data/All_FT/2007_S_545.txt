1.  A short question which arises in these two civil appeals is : whether banks are "dealers" under Section 2(viii) read with Explanation I of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963.
2.  Since common question of law arises in both the civil appeals, they are heard together and disposed of by this common judgment. For the sake of convenience, we may refer to the facts in C.A.No.6459 of 2003 filed by Federal Bank Ltd. and Ors. V. State of Kerala and Ors 2007 Indlaw SC 317.
3.  By the Kerala Finance Act, 1998 a clause (g) was inserted in Section 2(viii) by which the definition of the word "dealer" was expanded to cover a bank or a financial institution which, whether in the course of its business or not, sells any gold or other valuables pledged with it to secure any loan, for the realization of such loan amount. After the said amendment, the Department called upon Federal Bank to furnish details of the gold auction during the year 1998-1999 and 1999-2000. This was vide notice dated 31.8.99 issued by the Sales Tax Officer to the assessee. On 1.11.99 the Department called upon the bank to furnish details of the turnover relating to the gold auction sale on and after 1.4.98; the Department also called upon the assessee to pay tax at 4% on the sale turnover within 15 days. This was vide notice dated 1.11.99. Federal Bank submitted its reply contending that a scheduled bank cannot be compared with a pawn broker and, therefore, it was not a dealer under the 1963 Act. The Federal Bank refused to file its return on the ground that there was no sale of ornaments pledged to the bank and that the position of the bank remained unaltered even after introduction of clause (g) in Section 2(viii) of the 1963 Act vide Kerala Finance Act 1998 dated 29.7.98.
4.  Ultimately, Federal Bank Ltd. filed O.P.No.1169 of 2000 in the Kerala High Court challenging the validity of Section 2(viii)(g) of the 1963 Act as also the notices issued by the Department pursuant to the Kerala Finance Act, 1998 directing Federal Bank to file returns and pay tax on sale of pledged articles.
5.  By judgment and order dated 11.4.2002 the Single Judge held that in view of Kerala Finance Act, 1998, by which clause (g) stood incorporated under Section 2(viii) of the 1963 Act, the transaction of sale, whether in the course of business or not, would cover auction sale or ornaments pledged with the bank. Therefore, banks, according to the learned Single Judge, came within the definition of the word "dealer" and since the pledged articles were goods and since the sale was for money consideration, Section 5 of the 1963 was applicable and in the circumstances the leaned Single Judge upheld the demand notices leaving the question of legislative competence open to challenge.
6.  Aggrieved by the said decision of the learned Single Judge, Federal Bank along with other banks carried the matter in appeal. By the impugned judgment dated 3.4.03 it was held that in view of the Kerala Finance Act, 1998 under which the definition of the word "dealer" is expanded to cover banks, the Department was right in seeking to cover the transactions of auction sale of pledged gold articles. It was further held that amended Section 2(viii)(g) was intra vires the Constitution of India and that the said section did not infringe Articles 14 and 19 of the  Constitution. It was further held that even assuming that the transaction of sale of pledged articles is not a part of the main business activity still the said transaction would come within the meaning of incidental or ancillary to the business of banking and in the circumstances there was no infirmity in the judgment of the learned Single Judge. Accordingly, the Division Bench dismissed the writ appeals filed by the appellants herein. Hence, this civil appeal.
7.  At the outset, we may point out that before us the Constitutional validity of Section 2(viii)(g) of the 1963 Act was not argued. Before us it was urged on behalf of banks (appellants) that although by the Kerala Finance Act, 1998 the definition of the word "dealer" under Section 2(viii) of the 1963 Act stood expanded so as to include banks, the said Act was still not applicable to "sale" of pledged ornaments as the said transaction did not take place in the course of banking business in terms of Section 2 (xxi). It was submitted that the word "sale" is defined in the said section to mean every transfer of the property in goods by one person to another in the course of trade or business for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration excluding mortgage, hypothecation charge or pledge. According to the banks (appellants) since the auction sale of pledged ornaments did not fall within the definition of the word "sale" in Section 2(xxi), such transaction are not exigible to tax under the said Act, even after the insertion of clause (g) to Section 2(viii). On behalf of the banks it was further submitted that even under 1949 Act the word "banking" has been defined under Section 5(b) to mean accepting, for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise.
8. According to the banks (appellants) auction sale of pledged ornaments does not come under the definition of the word "banking" under Section 5(b) of the 1949 Act and, therefore, it cannot be said that the banks were in the business of selling pledged ornaments. On behalf of banks it was further submitted that under Section 6 of the 1949 Act, in addition to the business of banking, a banking company may engage in one of the following forms of business, namely, borrowing, raising of loans, lending with or without security, drawing of bills, accepting bills, discounting, buying, selling, collecting and dealing in bills of exchange. According to the banks (appellants) the "banking business" consists of accepting deposits from the public. However, under Section 6 a bank is permitted to engage in the other form of business apart from acceptance of deposits.
9. According to the banks (appellants) Section 6 enables a banking company if it so desires to engage in other form of business stipulated in Section 6(1)(a) of the 1949 Act. It was further contended that under Section 8 of the said 1949 Act, banks are prohibited expressly from trading in goods except to the extent of buying or selling of goods in realization of security given to it by the borrower. Under the Explanation to Section 8 of the 1949 "goods" are defined to mean every kind of movable property other than actionable claims, stocks, shares, money etc. It is submitted that in view of Section 8 banks cannot sell goods in the course of business and in view of the said prohibition it cannot be said that banks are in the business of selling pledged ornaments. Therefore, according to the banks (appellants) auction sale of pledged ornaments by banks for realization of security will not fall in the course of banking business and, therefore, such transactions will not come within the definition of the word "sale" as defined in Section 2(xxi) of the 1963 Act.
10.  We do not find any merit in the above contention. As stated above, we are not concerned in the present civil appeals with the question of legislative competence of the State Legislature to insert clause (g) in Section 2(viii) of the 1963 Act. In the present case, we are concerned only with the limited question argued before us, namely, whether auction sale of pledged goods by scheduled banks is a "transaction" which takes place in the course of banking business in terms of the 1949 Act. In the present case, we are concerned with the situation which arose after enactment of the Kerala Finance Act, 1998. By that amendment the definition of the word "dealer" in Section 2(viii) was expressly amended to mean any person who carries on business of buying, selling, supplying or distributing goods for cash or deferred payment or for any other valuable consideration. It is important to note that prior to Kerala Finance Act, 1998 there was litigation. The result of that litigation was that the High Court had taken the view in the earlier rounds that sale of pledged ornaments did not fall "in the course of banking business" and in order to get over the judgments, the Kerala Legislature introduced clause (g) to Section 2(viii) by making it clear that even if the sale of pledged ornaments took place, not in the course of business, still such a transaction would make the person (banks/financial institutions) a "dealer" under Section 2(viii) of the 1963 Act. Therefore, in deciding the matter we have to keep in mind the object behind the Kerala Finance Act, 1998.

FORM B Form of Profit and Loss Account
Profit and Loss Account for the year ended
12.  General Instructions The corresponding figures (to the nearest rupee, if so desired for the year immediately preceding the year to which the profit and loss account relates should be shown in separate columns." In order to answer the contentions raised on behalf of the banks (appellants) it is important to note that we are concerned with the 1963 Act. The said Act is enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to the levy of tax on sale or purchase of goods in State of Kerala. In our opinion, the word "sale" in Section 2(xxi) of the 1963 is very important.
13. The word "sale" is defined to mean transfer of the property in goods in the course of trade or business for cash, deferred payment or for any other valuable consideration. This definition is different from the definition of the word "sale" under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. When the pledged article is put to auction it is no doubt for satisfaction of claims. It also results in an income from non-banking assets.
14. The first question which, therefore, arises is : whether sale of pledged ornaments for consideration falls in the course of trade or business of the bank. It is no doubt true that banks have to act on instructions of the borrower. In the present case, we are not concerned with the provisions of Section 176 of the Contract Act, 1872. We are concerned with the definition of the word "sale" under the 1963 Act. When a bank sells the pledged ornaments it is not acting as an agent of the borrower even under the 1949 Act. When the bank sells the goods pledged to them they do not act as the agents of the borrower. As pledgees, the banks, acting under Section 176 of the Contract Act, 1872 have a right to sell the goods. That sale is not as agents but that sale is in exercise of the statutory power under the 1949 Act. No doubt the sale is on behalf of the pledgor, however, the sale is in exercise of the statutory power [See: The Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes v. A.R.S. Thirumeninatha Nadar Firm (1968) 21 STC 184 (Mad 1967 Indlaw MAD 68)]. To the same effect is the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of High Channel Video v. Enclave Electronics and others (1999) 116 STC 131 (P. and H.)] Further on reading the provisions of the 1949 Act, one finds that every bank is required to maintain its balance-sheet in Form 'A" of the Third Schedule, quoted above. The prescribed form indicates that non-banking assets acquired by the banks even in satisfaction of claims, are required to declare their holdings.
15. The prescribed form of balance-sheet indicates that banks are required to show on the asset side non-banking assets acquired by them in satisfaction of claims. Similarly, in Form 'B' of the Third Schedule under Profit and Loss Account, banks are required to show income from non- banking assets and profit from sale of such assets. In our view, therefore, sale of pledged assets takes place in the course of banking business. Therefore, as stated above, the banks, in selling the goods pledged to them, did not act as agents of the borrowers/pledgors and that their sale was in exercise of statutory power under the 1949 Act. Further, in our view it is no doubt true that under Section 8 of the 1949 Act banks are prohibited from trading in goods. However, if one reads Section 8 along with Third Schedule to the 1949 Act it is clear that dealing in non-banking assets is a banking business and the exception made in Section 8 which allows banks to realize security and which allows banks to engage in trade in order to realize security, falls within the banking business whenever undertaken. When a pledged article is sold in an auction, the bank recovers not only its dues but also recovers interests and its other charges. This realization falls within the parameters of the Third Schedule to the 1949 Act. In the circumstances, we are of the view that sale of pledged ornaments falls within the course of banking business under the 1949 Act. In the circumstances, such transactions are taxable under Section 2(viii)(g) read with Section 5 of the 1963 Act. We also find merit in the contention advanced on behalf of the Department (respondents herein) that the very object of the Kerala Finance Act, 1998 was to introduce clause (g) in Section 2(viii) in order to get over the judgments of the High Court which took the view that sale of pledged goods did not fall in the course of banking business. We have quoted clause (g). That clause makes it very clear that even if the sale of pledged ornaments takes place outside the banking business, the 1963 Act would cover even such transactions. Therefore, once such transactions fall under Section 2(viii)(g) of the 1963 Act, banks become "dealers" and they are liable to pay sales tax under the said 1963 Act. It is true that the definition of the word "sale" under Section 2(xxi) of the 1963 Act does not include mortgage, hypothecation charge or pledge, however, the important point to be noted is that the definition of the word "sale" under the 1963 Act is not the same as under Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The definition of the word "sale" in Section 2(xxi) in the 1949 is very similar to Section 2(g) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 which is held to be having a very wide meaning as compared to the definition of the word "sale" in Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 [See: State of Maharashtra v. Embee Corporation, Bombay - 1997 (7) SCC 190 1997 Indlaw SC 584]. Further, when charge or pledge is enforced that enforcement is by way of sale of the pledged or hypothecated goods; that sale is for consideration and, therefore, it falls within the ambit of Section 2 (xxi) of the 1963 Act.
16.  In the circumstances, there is no infirmity in the impugned judgments of the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court.
17.  Accordingly, the above civil appeals have no merit and they are dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed
