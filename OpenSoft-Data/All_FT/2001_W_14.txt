Supreme Court of India

12 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.2313/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In the order under challenge the High Court declined to interfere with the order passed by the Union of India referring the dispute for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal and dismissed the Letters Patent Appeal filed by the petitioner. We are not satisfied that any interference with the order is warranted.
2. However, it will be open to the petitioner to raise the question of the relationship of master and servant between it and the workmen concerned before the Industrial Tribunal and if such question is raised, the Tribunal will consider the same in accordance with law.
With these observations, the special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
