Vesma Moti Khadki Desai Samast Trust and Others v Dhirubhai Manibhai Desai
Supreme Court of India

31 January 1995
C.As. No. 2325 of 1978 with No. 2326 of 1978
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals are a sequel to the suit instituted by the appellants-plaintiffs for recovery of possession of agricultural land on the basis of the certificate of exemption granted to them under Section 88-B of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (the Act). The possession was sought to be recovered from the respondents who were tenants on the land. The trial court dismissed the suit.
2.   The appeal filed by the appellants was also dismissed by the High Court. These appeals by grant of certificate by the High Court. These appeals by grant of certificate by the High Court are against the judgment of the High Court.
3.  We have heard learned counsel for the appellants. It is no doubt correct that the certificate of exemption was granted to the appellants under Section 88-B of the Act. But later on, under Section 31 of the Gujarat Devasthan Inams Abolition Act, 1969 (the 1969 Act), Section 88-E was inserted in the Act, Section 88-E(1) is in the following terms:
"88-E. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 88-B, with effect on an from specified date lands which are the property of an institution for public religious worship shall cease to be exempted from those provisions of the Act except Section 31 to 31-D (both inclusive) from which they were exempted under Section 88-B and all certificate granted under that section in respect of such lands shall stand revoked."
4.  The trial court and the High Court relying upon Section 88-E(1) of the 1969 Act, came to the conclusion that the certificate of exemption granted to the appellants under Section 88-B stood revoked on coming into force of the said section.
5.  We see no infirmity in the judgment of the High Court. We agree with the reasoning and the conclusions reached therein. The appeals are dismissed. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
