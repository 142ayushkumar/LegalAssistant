Intercontinental (India) v Indian Sugar and Gen.Ind.E and I. Corporation Ltd. and Anr
Supreme Court of India

16 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3692/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Dr. AM. Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that inasmuch as the bank guarantee has been encashed, he has instructions to withdraw the Special Leave Petition.
However, he submits that in the impugned order observations are made with regard to merits of the contract which are likely to prejudice his case in the main suit. It goes without saying that in the disposal of an interlocutory application if any prima facie findings are recorded or observations are made they cannot be taken into consideration while deciding the suit or the main matter on merits.
2. Subject to above observations, the Special Leave Petition is dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
