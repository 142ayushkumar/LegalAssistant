Supreme Court of India

17 April 2002
C.A. Nos. 9049-9051 of 1996, Dt. 17 April 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the Revenue (Appellant) and find that the order of the Tribunal is correct. Reliance has rightly been placed, given the facts, upon the judgment of this Court inUnion of India and Ors.v.Madhumilan Syntex Pvt. Ltd. 1988 Indlaw SC 395.
2.  Our attention has been drawn by learned counsel for the appellant to the judgment of this Court inElson Machines Pvt. Ltd.v.Collector of Central Excise 1988 Indlaw SC 276 and it is submitted that a different view has been taken therein. We do not think so.
3. The latter judgment only says that there is no estoppel against seeking to take a different view from that taken in an approved classification list. But that judgment does not say that a demand notice can be issued demanding duty on a basis other than that approved in the classification list without seeking to vary the classification list. The appeals are dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
