State of Uttar Pradesh and Another v V. N. Prasad Dr
Supreme Court of India

19  May  1994
C.A. No. 4585 of 1994 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) No. 9728 of 1994 (CC 25654))
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned counsel on both sides. Delay condoned. Special leave granted.
2.  The High Court, at the interlocutory stage of writ petition moved by the respondent, Dr. V. N. Prasad, Principal, B.R.D. Medical College, Gorakhpur challenging an order of transfer, has stayed its operation.
3. We are of the opinion that at the stage at which the matter was brought to engage the attention of the High Court, there was no prima facie material to establish any mala fides which required strong and convincing evidence. The presumption is in favour of the bona fides of the order unless contradicted by acceptable material.
The interlocutory order of the High Court is, in our opinion, unjustified. The order is set aside. We request the High Court however, to dispose of the main matter itself as expeditiously as possible
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
