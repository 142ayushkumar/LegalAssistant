The order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  On hearing Counsel on either side, it is not possible for us to sustain the order of the High Court dismissing the petition 'in limini'.
2. Since the questions which are involved in this petition are also pending in several other matters in the High Court, this petition is also directed to be heard on merits along with those petitions. In the meantime, the guarantee furnished pursuant to the orders of this Court will continue to operate till the disposal of the petition by the High Court.
Order accordingly.
