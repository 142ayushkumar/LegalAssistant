P.I.Kapur v N.L.Parekh
Supreme Court of India

13 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17193/1999
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1. In a statutory appeal a Division Bench of the High Court dismissed it with a cryptic order, which reads thus: "P.C. Appeal dismissed." We are not aware of the reasons which would have persuaded the Division Bench in adopting that course. Reasons are the flesh and blood of a judicial order without which the superior court cannot discern objectively to what would have persuaded the judicial mind in reaching that conclusion. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order of the Division Bench and remit the appeal back to the Division Bench of the High Court for fresh disposal on merits.
This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
