U O I and Anr v N.D. Sampath Krishna Setty and Others
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3273-3275/1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The order of this Court dated 23th March, 2001 stated that if no application for substituted service upon respondent no.4 was made within two weeks, the special leave petition would stand dismissed as against respondent no.4. No application for substituted service was made within two weeks. Accordingly, the S.L.P. as against respondent no.4 was dismissed.
2. Now, in this restoration application, it is not denied that the application for substituted service was not filed within two weeks. It is stated that it was filed two days thereafter. No good cause to restore the S.L.P. as against respondent no.4 is made out.
3.  Learned counsel states that respondent nos.1, 2 and 3 and respondent no.4 are co-parceners and that, if the restoration application is not allowed, the S.L.P. will fail as against the other co-parceners. If that was the position, there was greater need to comply with an order of this Court which clearly stated that the application for substituted service must be filed within two weeks, failing which the S.L.P. would stand dismissed as against respondent no.4.
4.  The application for restoration is dismissed. The application for substituted service, therefore, does not survive.
5.  In view of learned counsel's statement, the special leave petitions are dismissed.
6. On the application of learned Attorney General, a copy of this order as also any order that indicates lack of diligence on the part of the Central Agency shall be furnished to him.
Petition dismissed.
