P. Iya Nadar Charitable Trust v Commissioner of Income Tax, Maduri
Supreme Court of India

26 March 2007
C.A. No. 1679 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In the present matter, the High Court has failed to carry out its statutory duty of framing substantial questions of law as required under section 260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The High Court has interfered with the concurrent findings given by the Commissioner of Income-tax and the Tribunal without giving any reasons.
2. On that ground alone, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court. We express no opinion on the merits of the case. High Court is requested to dispose of the matter as expeditiously as possible.
Appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
