C.A. No. 254 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 16424 of 1991)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  In this case the original application for refund was filed beyond six months of the date of payment. It was accordingly rejected.

The Division Bench affirmed the said order.
2.  It is obvious that in the light of the judgment of this Court in Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of India1996 Indlaw SC 1515the judgment of the High Court is liable to be set aside.
3. The judgments of the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court are set aside.
The appeal is allowed accordingly. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
