The order of the court was as follows:
IA No. 3
1.  The applicants have prayed for two reliefs in this application. This application is an offshoot of the judgment passed by the Constitution Bench of this Court on 10-4-2008, Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India, 2008 Indlaw SC 596.
2.  A question had been raised in this application as to what should be the extent of cut-off marks for admission of students of OBCs in the Central educational institutions.
3. Having heard the learned Solicitor General of India and learned Senior Counsel on both the sides and also having regard to the observations made in the judgments pronounced by this Court, we make it clear that the maximum cut-off marks for OBCs be 10% below the cut-off marks of general category candidates.
4.  We are told that in many of the Central educational institutions the seats which are to be filled up by OBC candidates are still remaining vacant. These institutions may endeavour to fill up these vacant seats by other eligible students at the earliest i.e. at least by the end of October 2008 observing inter se merit of the candidates.
5. All other rules and regulations regarding admissions shall be strictly followed. The application is disposed of accordingly.
