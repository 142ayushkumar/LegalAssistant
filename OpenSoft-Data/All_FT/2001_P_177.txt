State of Uttar Pradesh v Prem Lal Patel and Another
Supreme Court of India

31 October 2001
CIVIL APPEAL No.2742/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The State of Uttar Pradesh is in appeal against the judgment of Allahabad High Court dated 3.4.2000. Under the impugned judgment the Ordinance X of 2000, by means of which the provisions of U.P. Panchayati Raj Act were amended, was declared unconstitutional and ultra vires. While the matter was pending in this Court, elections have already been held pursuant to the direction of this Court, and in the meantime, the Ordinance itself has been replaced by the Act of the Legislature. The validity of the said Act has not been assailed before any forum nor has there been any declaration to that effect.
2. In such circumstances, we do not think it necessary for us to examine the correctness of the impugned judgment, and in our view the appeal has become infructuous.
The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
The questions of law raised here remain open.
3.  The SLP is disposed of in view of the order passed in the Civil Appeal.
Appeal disposed of.
