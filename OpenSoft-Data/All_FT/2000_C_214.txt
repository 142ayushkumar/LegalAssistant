Commissioner of Income Tax v Srinivasa Hatcheries Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

4 February 2000
C.A. No. 841 of 2000
The Judgment was delivered by: BHARUCHA, J.
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court, by the order under challenge, declined to call upon the Tribunal to refer to it the following question on the ground that the Tribunal had followed the High Court's judgment in the case of CIT vs. Sri Venkateshwara Hatcheries (P) Ltd. 1988 Indlaw AP 1161988 Indlaw AP 116.
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the poultry sheds should be treated as plant thereby allowing the assessee-company a higher rate of depreciation as applicable to plant and not the rate of depreciation as applicable to building ?"
2.  We are informed that the judgment of the High Court in the said case of CIT vs. Sri Venkateshwara Hatcheries (P) Ltd. (supra) was brought to this Court but the special leave petition was dismissed on the ground of delay.
3. It appears to us clear that a question of law is involved and that therefore, the High Court ought to have required the Tribunal to refer to it the aforestated question. The High Court then would be entitled to consider the question on the merits and take the earlier judgment in the case of CIT vs. Sri Venkateshwara Hatcheries (P) Ltd. (supra) into account.
4.  The appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The aforesaid question shall be referred by the Tribunal to the High Court for its decision, after drawing up a statement of case. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
