State of Andhra Pradesh and Others v G. V. Krishnarao and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 November 2001
C.A. No. 2748 of 1987 With S.L.P. (C) No. 8867 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
CA No. 2748 of 1987:
1.  The principal question that is involved in this case is whether the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal can strike down a law passed by the State Legislature in exercise of the powers conferred on it under Article 371-D(3) of the Constitution.
2. Learned counsel for the State fairly submits that these Tribunals have been replaced by the Tribunals constituted under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, and that, therefore, the question does not survive for consideration.
The appeal is therefore dismissed. No order as to costs.
SLP (C) No. 8867 of 1987:
The special leave petition raising the same question is also dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
