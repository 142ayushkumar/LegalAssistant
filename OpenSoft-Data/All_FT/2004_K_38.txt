Kamal v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

15 October 2004
Cr.A. No. 1202 of 2004 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 3599 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This is a case in which the appellant has been convicted under Section 304-B IPC and sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years. It appears that so far the appellant has undergone imprisonment for about 2 years and four months. The High Court declined to grant bail pending disposal of the appeal before it. We are of the view that the bail should have been granted by the High Court, especially having regard to the fact that the appellant has already served a substantial period of the sentence.
2. In the circumstances, we direct that bail be granted to the appellant on such conditions as may be imposed by the District and Sessions Judge, Faridabad.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
