Supreme Court of India

27 March 1998
Cr.A. No. 373 of 1998 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 380 of 1998)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted. Heard learned counsel
1.  In view of the long incarceration of the appellant since 25-5-1996 and the trial likely to consume some time, we think that a case for grant of bail has been made out in favour of the appellant. Accordingly, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned orders of the High Court and direct release of the appellant on bail in the sum of Rs. 1 lakh with two sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Special Judge, Animal Husbandry, Patna.
2. The bail bond would be accepted on the condition that if the appellant is a passport-holder, he shall surrender the passport to the Special Judge, Animal Husbandry, Patna.
Appeal allowed.
