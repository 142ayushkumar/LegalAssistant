Union of India v Merajuddin
Supreme Court of India

12 April 1999
Cr.A. No. 426 of 1999 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 2838 of 1998)
The Order of the Court is as follows:
Leave granted.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The respondent is accused of an offence under the NDPS Act, 1985. The High Court appears to have completely ignored the mandate of Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act while granting him bail. The High Court overlooked the prescribed procedure. That was not proper.
2.  We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order of the High Court and cancel the bail granted to the respondent.
3.  The respondent is directed to surrender before the trial court within two weeks and if after surrender, he files an application for grant of bail, the same shall be considered on its own merits uninfluenced by the order made by us today.
4. In case the respondent does not surrender within the aforesaid period, the trial court will take steps for apprehending the respondent and remanding him to judicial custody. Appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
Appeal allowed.
