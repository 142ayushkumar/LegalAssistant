Shahzade v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

28 January 1981
Cr.A. No. 73 of 1981
The Order of the Court is as follows
1.  In this appeal, Special leave granted was confined to the question of sentence only
2.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having gone through the judgments of the Courts below, we find that in the peculiar circumstances of this case and having regard to the very old age of the appellant Shahzade, who is more than 77 years of age, there is some room for reduction in the sentence. We, therefore, reduce the sentence of the appellant u/s. 452 from four years to six months' rigorous imprisonment and make it concurrent with the sentence awarded u/s. 323 read with Section 34, Indian Penal Code, 1860
With this modification in the sentence, the appeal is dismissed.
Appeal Dismissed.
