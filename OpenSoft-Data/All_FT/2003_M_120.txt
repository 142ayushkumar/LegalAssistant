Supreme Court of India

7 April 2003
C.A. No. 3029 of 2003 (Along with C.A. Nos. 3030 to 3032 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The challenge in this appeal is the order dated 28th May, 2001 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant-Board against the order dated 30th September, 2000 passed in CD No. 321/ 1993 by the State Commission of Orissa. By that order, the State Commission had decided four complaints and assessed Rs. 39,157/- as damages for defects in each of the houses of the four complainants. Our attention has been drawn by the learned counsel for the appellant to similar orders, which are pending adjudication in First Appeal Nos. 133-138/1998 before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.
2. We have also been taken through the order passed by the State Commission . It is evident that the cases relied upon by the State Commission in its order dated 30th September, 2000 are pending in appeal before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. In this view, it would be appropriate that if First Appeal No. 104/2001 is decided along with other pending matters (First Appeal Nos. 133-138/1998).
3.  We may note the submission of the learned counsel for the Board that on the basis of the impugned order, various orders are being passed by the State Commission despite the fact that the similar matters as aforesaid are pending before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.
4.  Without expressing any opinion on merit, under the aforesaid circumstances, we set aside the impugned order and remit the First Appeal No. 104/2001 for fresh decision by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The appeal is accordingly disposed of. We request the Commission that as far as possible to expeditiously dispose of the matter.
Appeal disposed of.
