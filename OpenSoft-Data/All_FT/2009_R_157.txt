"However, keeping in view the order passed by the Supreme Court in Inter Singh case 1997 Indlaw SC 650 (supra) we direct that if within thirty days from today, the respondent opts to seek voluntary retirement from the post of sub Inspector, then his request be accepted and he be retired from that post. If he fails to give option, then the respondent shall be deemed to have been reverted to his parent cadre in District Gurgaon on the post of Head Constable. In that event, he will be entitled to retain the promoted post of sub Inspector and will have to stand in queue for being considered for promotion from the dates his juniors in the parent cadre were promoted and that too after undergoing the requisite course and passing the prescribed examinations."
