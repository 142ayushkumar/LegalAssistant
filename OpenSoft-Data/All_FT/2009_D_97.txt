Dhannu @ Dhanna and Others v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

12 August 2009
Criminal Appeal No. 1213 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. The appellants along with accused Alam @ Dabbu were convicted by the Trial Court under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life. On appeal being preferred, the High Court confirmed their conviction. After the passing of the impugned order, accused Alam @ Dabbu died; as such, the present appeal by special leave has been filed by the remaining three accused persons.
2.  Having heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties and perused the records, we are of the view that the Trial Court was well as the High Could have convicted the appellants upon threadbare discussion of evidence and we do not find any infirmity therein; as such, it is not possible to interfere with the impugned orders. The appeal, accordingly, fails and the same is dismissed.
3.  Bail bonds of the appellants, who are on bail, are cancelled and they are directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence.
Appeal dismissed.
