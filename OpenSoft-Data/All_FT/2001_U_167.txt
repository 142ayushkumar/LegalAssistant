14 September 2001
C.A. No.3303 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Leave has been granted and the matter comes up today for confirmation of the interim relief granted on 23rd April, 2001.
2.  Learned counsel for the respondent, fairly, submits that the order under challenge, which is an interim order in his writ petition, may be set aside and the High Court may be directed to hear the writ petition itself on its own merits.
3. We think that that is an appropriate order to pass, having regard to what is stated in the order under challenge. This shall have no reflection on the merits of the case on either side.
4.  The civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside.
The writ petition shall be heard on its own merits expeditiously.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
