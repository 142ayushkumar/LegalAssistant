Supreme Court of India

5  May  2008
Civil Appeal No. 3356 of 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 10129 of 2008)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties, we are of the view that since the Writ Petition is pending decision and the present appeal is only against an interim order passed therein, the interest of the parties would be best served if the High Court could be requested to hear out the Writ Petition as early as possible.
2.  We accordingly dispose of the appeal with a request to the High Court to dispose of the pending Writ Petition as early as possible, but preferably within a period of three months from date.
3.  In the meantime, the parties are directed to maintain status quo as far as the appellants' plot No. 533 and any portion thereof, if included in the proposed road, is concerned.
