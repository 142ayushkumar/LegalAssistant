Sarita Singh v A. P. Baghel
Supreme Court of India

28 February 2005
Transfer Petition (C) No. 817 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Petition admitted.
1.  In this petition the petitioner wife has sought for transfer of Suit No. 29 of 2004, titled A.P. Baghel v. Sarita Singh pending in the Family Court, Lucknow to the competent court of jurisdiction in Delhi.
2. In a similar transfer petition filed for transfer of another case between the same parties this Court by an order dated 10-12-2004 while refusing to allow the transfer had directed to the respondent to pay in advance a sum of Rs.3,000 to the petitioner who is also petitioner in this case on the dates of hearing before the Delhi court.
3.  We think a similar order in this case also would meet the ends of justice. We firstly direct the Family Court, Lucknow to hear Suit No. 29 of 2004 titled A.P. Baghel v. Sarita Singh and Suit No. 713 of 2004 between the same parties together on the same day. If for any reason this is not possible then for the days of travel and stay in this case, that is, Suit No. 29 of 2004 the respondent will pay to the petitioner a sum of Rs. 3,000 per day.
With the above directions, this petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
