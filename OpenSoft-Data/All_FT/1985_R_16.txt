Union of India v Rajnikant Bros
Supreme Court of India

18 April 1985
C.A. No. 1423 of 1984.
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  We have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through the judgments of the High Courts of Bombay and Delhi. We are unable to find, in the facts and circumstances of the case, any requirement of diversification of exports as a condition for the grant of Export House Certificates in the Import Policy for the year 1978-79. While confirming the High Court's judgment, quashing the order impugned in the writ petitions in the High Court we direct the appellants to issue the necessary Export House Certificates for the year 1978-79.
2.   The Export House Certificates shall be granted within 3 months from this date. Save and except items which are specifically banned under the prevalent import policy at the time of import, the respondents shall be entitled to import all other item whether canalised or otherwise in accordance with the relevant rules. The appeals are disposed of accordingly with no orders as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
