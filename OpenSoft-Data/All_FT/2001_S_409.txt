Commissioner of Income Tax v Sri Ramdas Motor Transport Limited
Supreme Court of India

23 August 2001
C.A. No. 4909 of 1999 (From the judgment and order Dt. 27 August 1998 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in ITC No. 15 of 1993, reported as CIT vs. Shri Ramdas Motor Transport 2000 163 CTR (AP) 403 : 1999 238 ITR 177 (AP)).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Revenue moved the High Court under s. 256(2) of the IT Act, 1961, seeking a reference of eleven questions.
The High Court disposed of the application by a lengthy judgment that concluded by saying that no question of law was found. Among the eleven question, were questions Nos. 3 and 4, which read thus :
"3. Whether the interpretation of the Tribunal as regards the scope and ambit under s. 132(4) is correct ?
4. Whether the Tribunal is justified in holding that Explanation to s. 132(4) is prospective in nature; though the said Explanation laid down only rule of evidence and in that sense it is only procedural in nature ?"
2.  In this appeal by the Revenue, leave has been granted restricted to question Nos. 3 and 4.
3.  As will be seen, these questions deal with the scope and ambit of s. 132(4) of the Act and the Explanation thereto and whether or not it is prospective in nature. In its long judgment declining to call for a reference, the High Court has, in effect, interpreted s. 132(4) and its Explanation, which it could not have done without calling for a reference of the concerned questions and hearing it.
On this short ground alone, the judgment and order under challenge needs to be set aside.
4.  Mr. K. Parasaran, learned counsel for the assessee, submitted that instead of sending the matter back to the High Court for considering these questions on reference, we should deal with them ourselves because there was a difference of opinion among certain High Courts with regard of the provisions of s. 132(4) and the Explanation thereto.
5.  We are disinclined to do so. The High Court itself must consider the questions and, in doing so, the judgments of the High Courts that deal with s. 132(4) and its Explanation. Should the High Court come to the conclusion that the Explanation to s. 132(4) is retrospective in nature, it shall consider whether the Tribunal was right in the order that it passed, having regard to the evidence on record.
6.  The civil appeal is allowed. The judgment and order under challenge is set aside.
The application of the Revenue for a reference under s. 256(2) is allowed insofar as it relates to question Nos. 3 and 4 aforementioned. The Tribunal shall refer those questions to the High Court for consideration, after drawing up a statement of case.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
