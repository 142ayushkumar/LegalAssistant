Manager, State Bank of Hyderabad and Others v Puran
Supreme Court of India

11 October 1999
C.A. No. 5899/1999, Dt. 11 October 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  Without going into the merits of the case because that may prejudice the writ petition which has been filed in the High Court by the respondent, we are clearly of the opinion that by way of an interim order the High Court could not have directed compassionate appointment to be given to the respondent either on casual or temporary or any other basis. Serious complications would arise if such interim order was complied with and ultimate it was found that the writ petition had no merit.
2. While allowing this appeal and setting aside the judgment of the High Court, in our opinion, it would be in order if the High Court hears the main writ petition itself and disposes of the same at an early date.
3.  Rs. 5,000 shall be paid by way of legal expenses by the appellants to the counsel for the respondent.
Appeal allowed.
