Devender Roy v Union of India and another
Supreme Court of India

13 February 2002
S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 4040 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Registrar of the High Court of Gauhati (Agartala Bench) is directed to send original records of the Sessions Court and the High Court within a week to the Registry of this Court.
2.  We heard Mr A. Sharan, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner and Mr Altaf Ahmed, learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondent Union of India at length.
3.  The main question that arises for determination in this case relates to exercise of the power vested in the competent authority of the Border Security Force to move the Magistrate/Sessions Judge for release of the accused for the purpose of trial before the Border Security Force Court.
4.  In this regard two decisions rendered by the Division Bench in Joginder Singh v. State of H. P. 1970 Indlaw SC 403 and Supdt. and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, W.B. v. Usha Ranjan Roy Choudhury 1986 Indlaw SC 54 and a decision rendered by a three-Judge Bench in Delhi Special Police Establishment v. Lt. Col. S.K. Loraiya 1972 Indlaw SC 182 have been cited before us.
5. We find that the views expressed in the two Division Bench decisions are not identical.
6.  Mr. Altaf Ahmed, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the respondent Union of India submitted that the final verdict of this Court regarding the jurisdiction of the court for trial between the Border Security Force Court or regular criminal court in the facts of the present case shall affect the other criminal cases pending in various parts of different States of the country.
7.  In the circumstances above stated, we consider it appropriate that this case should be placed before a larger Bench for decision.
8.  Leave is granted to the counsel for the parties to mention before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for early listing of the case.
Order accordingly.
