State of U.P. v Ravi Dutt
Supreme Court of India

4 February 2003
Cr.A. No. 494 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The State has filed this appeal against the impugned judgment of the High Court whereby the conviction and sentence as awarded by the Court of Sessions was set aside. The Court of Sessions, on appreciation of evidence, in particular, that of P.W.1 and P.W.2 found the respondent guilty of offence under Section 302 for having committed the murder of his tenant Indrajit Singh. The High Court on re-appraisal of evidence, including those of the aforesaid two witnesses and the informant P.W.-3 brother of P.W.1., has come to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the respondent-accused. Various circumstances have been noticed by the High Court in judgment under appeal.
2. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. Under no circumstances, the view of the High Court can be said to be unreasonable. There are material contradictions in the statement of various witnesses which makes the case of the prosecution highly doubtful. The respondent has been rightly given the benefit of doubt. There is no infirmity in the impugned judgment.
3.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed. The bail bonds of the respondent are cancelled and sureties discharged.
Appeal dismissed.
