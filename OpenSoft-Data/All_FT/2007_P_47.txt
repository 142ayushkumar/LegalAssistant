Parekh Platinum Limited v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2007
S.L.P. to Appeal (Civil) No. 20122 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Since the company is under BIFR, we are of the view that ends of justice would be subserved if the petitioner assessee is directed to submit the title deeds of the properties belonging to the Group Company with the Registrar of the CESTAT within four weeks. The title deeds shall remain with the Registrar for a period of four weeks after the date of the decision by the CESTAT. Normally this Court does not interfere with orders of pre-deposit.
2.  However, in this case, the company is under BIFR which is one of the important factors to be considered in such matters. The undertaking filed by the Director of the Group Company before this Court is accepted and taken on file.
Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
