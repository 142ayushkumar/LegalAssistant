Govardhan Das Partani and Another v State of Andhra Pradesh and Another
Supreme Court of India

28 August 2000
Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions Nos. 3173 to 3188 of 2000 In Cr.As. Nos. 709 to 724 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We are not inclined to interfere with the conviction passed by the court under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. However, in view of the subsequent development that admittedly the appellant has paid a sum of Rs. 2,15,000 (rupees two lakhs and fifteen thousand only) which is the amount covered by the cheques, we are inclined to show some leniency to the appellant in the matter on the sentence. It is true that learned counsel for the complainant submitted that the principal amount is not sufficient to clear the entire liability.
2. None the less, we considered the fact that at least the principal amount has been paid. It is open to the respondent to resort to other civil remedies for realising the balance amount, if any, due to him.
3.  We, therefore, restore the sentence passed on the appellant by the Sessions Court in appeal i.e., a fine of Rs. 2,000 alone. In default of payment of fine within two months, he shall undergo imprisonment for a period of one month.
Appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
