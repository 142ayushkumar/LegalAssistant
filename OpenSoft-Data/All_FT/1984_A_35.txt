Miles India Limited v Assistant Collector of Customs
Supreme Court of India

6 April 1984
C.A. No. 1633/84
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  After the matter was heard for some time and it was indicated that the Customs Authorities, acting under the Act, were justified in disallowing the claim for refund as they were bound by the period of limitation provided therefore u/s. 27(1) of the Customs Act, 1962, learned counsel for the Appellant sought leave to withdraw the appeal.
2.   We accord their leave to withdraw the appeal but make it clear that the order of the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal suffers from no infirmity.
3.  If really the payment of the duty was under a mistake of law, the appellant may seek recourse to such alternative remedy as it may be advised. The appeal is accordingly dismissed as withdrawn.
Appeal Dismissed.
