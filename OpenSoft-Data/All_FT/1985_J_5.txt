Jagdish and others v Harendrajit Singh
Supreme Court of India

31 October 1985
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 3248 of 1985
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  This special leave petition is directed against an order passed by the High Court setting aside the order of the trial court granting bail to the petitioners.
2.  This Court does not ordinarily, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 136, entertain petitions for special leave to appeal against orders granting or refusing or cancelling bail or anticipatory bail.
These are matters where the High Court should become final and this Court should not entertain petitions for special leave. The special leave petition is dismissed with these observations. We hope and trust that the trial will be expedited and completed at an early date.
Petitions dismissed.
