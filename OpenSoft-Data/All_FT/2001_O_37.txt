Oriental Insurance Company Limited v Alka Sharma and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6407/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave granted.
1.  This appeal filed by the Insurance Company is directed against the interim order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in FAO 458/2000 that during pendency of the appeal the claimant - respondents shall be entitled to withdraw Rs.8 lakhs out of Rs.9,82,000/- awarded as compensation by the Tribunal.
2.  Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the stand taken by the Insurance Company that the vehicle insured by it was not involved in the accident we are of the view that the order passed by the High Court should be modified.
3. Accordingly it is ordered that the appellant-Insurance Company shall deposit the amount of compensation as ordered by the Tribunal; out of the same a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- may be withdrawn by the claimants and the balanced amount shall be deposited in a fixed deposit in any nationalised bank. The High Court is requested to dispose of the appeal expeditiously if possible within four months of receipt of intimation of this order. The order under challenge stands modified to the extent noted above. The appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
