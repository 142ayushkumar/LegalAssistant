State of Andhra Pradesh v R. K. Rama Rao and Another
Supreme Court of India

11 August 1987
Review Petitions Nos. 736-37 of 1987 in C.As. Nos. 1295-96 and C.M.P. No. 17418 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. There are no grounds for review. The application is rejected. It is a great pity that though months have passed since our last order was made, the order has not yet been implemented. All that appears to have been done is that a review application has been filed, without even an application for stay. The Government of Andhra Pradesh appears to have granted a stay for itself. We do not think it was right for the Government to do so. The Government of Andhra Pradesh is directed to implement the order dated 1987, May 8, 1987 Indlaw SC 283561987 Indlaw SC 283561987 Indlaw SC 28356 within four weeks from today.
2. Review Petition Nos. 736-37 of 1987 are dismissed. Notice in C.M.P. No. 17418 of 1987. Personal attendance of respondents is dispensed with. Notice returnable in three weeks.
Petition dismissed.
