Union of India v Association For Democratic Reforms and Another
Supreme Court of India

12 July 2001
S.L.P. (C) No. 737 of 2001 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 2 November 2000 In CW.P. No. 7257 of 1999 of the High Court of Delhi At New Delhi)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Union of India has responded to the suggestions made by the Election Commission of India through an affidavit filed by Shri Surender Kumar, Under-Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs.
2. During the course of hearing, we got an impression that learned counsel for all the parties, including the Union of India and the Election Commission of India, are agreed that there is a need to check criminalisation of politics and misuse of money or muscle power during elections. So far as this aspect is concerned, therefore, all the parties appear to be in agreement.
3.  Before we take up the matter for final disposal, it would be helpful if the Union of India discusses the matter with all concerned, including other political parties, if necessary, to arrive at some consensus to achieve the objective mentioned above. The Union of India may do so in any manner which it considers appropriate.
4. We expect the learned Solicitor-General will inform this Court, the result of the deliberations which may take place as a result of discussions initiated by UOI, within 10 weeks.
List the matter after 10 weeks for directions.
Order accordingly.
