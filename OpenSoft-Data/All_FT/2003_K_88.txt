Karnataka Pradesh Hindu Maha Sabha v State of Karnataka and others
Supreme Court of India

17 July 2003
W.P. No. 934 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  By means of this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioner, who claims himself a public spirited person, has challenged the allotment of land of 811 acres 20 guntas, acquired and possession taken under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in the year 1960.
2. The further prayer is that the said land may be allotted only to landless, plotless and homeless poor people. The petitioner, before tiling this writ petition, had already filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Karnataka High Court, claiming substantially the same relief. The said writ petition was dismissed by the High Court. It is not disputed that against the said order and judgment, no appeal was filed, with the result the said judgment has attained finality.
3.  In that view of the matter, this petition is not maintainable and is, accordingly, dismissed with costs, which we assess as Rs 5000. The said costs may be remitted to the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee.
Petition dismissed.
