Narasimhamurthy v State of Karnataka
Supreme Court of India

24 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2366/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  As per the impugned order, the High Court declined to condone the delay of 249 days in filing an appeal by the appellant before the High Court.
2.  Appellant was convicted by a Sessions Court under Section 302 IPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life. He was in jail. For reasons narrated in the application supported with an affidavit sworn to by his wife, appellant was not able to file the appeal within the time permitted. No doubt there is no right vested in any party to have the delay condoned unless the party is able to satisfy the court that there is sufficient explanation for the same.
3. In considering the aforesaid explanation we cannot overlook two facts in a case like this.
4. First is that if the delay is not condoned, this appellant will lose the right of appeal against his conviction and sentence of imprisonment for life once and for all. Its corollary is that the court will also lose the chance of re-assessing or reconsidering the evidence on which the conviction and sentence were imposed on him by the trial court.
5. Second aspect is that the appellant in this case was already interned in a jail and his movements were considerably restricted and therefore he cannot be equated with a person who was free to lodge the appeal which the statute had conferred on him as a matter of right.
6.  Considering the aforesaid aspects, we are of the view that latitude can be shown to this appellant in spite of the long delay of 249 days in filing the appeal before the High Court. We therefore condone the said delay. This appeal is allowed to the above extent. Now, the High Court will have to consider and dispose of the appeal (filed by him challenging the conviction and sentence) in accordance with law. This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal partly allowed.
