United India Insurance Company Limited v Ajay Gupta
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2001
C.A. No. 4942 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal under Section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, arises out of the final judgment and order dated 28th February, 2001 of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The National Commission, while dealing with the issue, found that the complainant was entitled to a sum of Rs. 1, 98, 001/- on account of loss due to fire to the stocks inside the factory premises and he was also entitled to the loss to the boiler to the extent of Rs. 65, 994/- in terms of the policy of insurance.
2. The National Commission further recorded the entitlement of interest on the said amount @ 9% per annum from two months after the date of the final report to the Surveyors i.e. w.e.f. 23rd January, 1997 till the date of payment.
3.  The records depict that on a claim filed by the complainant in respect of various losses under various policies, a Surveyor was appointed and the Surveyor, on appointment in this case, assessed the loss of stock to the extent of Rs. 1, 98, 001/-and to the boiler at a sum of Rs. 65, 994/-. The only question that was raised before the Commission as also before this Court is that in terms of the policy of insurance, the coverage was only in regard to the property inside the factory premises and not to any loss suffered or damages to the property outside the factory.
4.  The National Commission in fact found that the Surveyor's report pertains to the loss due to the fire to the stocks inside the factory premises and hence decided the issue as above.
5.  On a perusal of the records and upon hearing the submissions, we do not see any reason to have a contra view in the matter and in the wake of the aforesaid, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order of the National Commission. Hence, the appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
