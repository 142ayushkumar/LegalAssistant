Civil Appeal No(s). 993 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  A short question which arises for determination in these Civil Appeal(s) is -
2. Whether the assessee(s) was under statutory obligation under Income Tax Act, 1961, and/or the Rules to collect evidence to show that its employee(s) had actually utilized the amount(s) paid towards Leave Travel Concession(s)/Conveyance Allowance?
3.  It may be noted that the beneficiary of exemption under Section 10(5) is an individual employee.

4.  For the above reasons there is no merit in the Civil Appeals and the same are dismissed with no order as to costs
