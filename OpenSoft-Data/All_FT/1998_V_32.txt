1.  We have heard learned counsel for both the sides.
2.  In our opinion considering the stage at which the matter was when the impugned order came to be passed by the trial court and which has been upheld by the High Court it cannot be said that by making an application for remand and obtaining an order for remand from the Court, the respondent can be said to have abused the process of the court. We would have given reasons in support of our order but as the matters are still pending in different courts, we do not think it proper to do so.
The appeals and writ petition are disposed of
