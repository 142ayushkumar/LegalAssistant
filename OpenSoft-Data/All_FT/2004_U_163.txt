Rakesh Kumar Miglani v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2004
Cr.A. No. 1410 of 2004 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 4245 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The appellant was intercepted by the Special Cell, Delhi Police, Ashok Vihar, New Delhi, and he was found to have handed over Rs 4 lakhs to Zafar Umar Khan and some other materials were also recovered from him. It appears that the appellant made a confession before the officers of the Enforcement Directorate and later he retracted from that confession. The appellant raised a contention that the retraction was not brought to the notice of the detaining authority and this fact is denied by the respondent.
2. This Court in K. Satyanarayan Subudhi v. Union of India 1013 (1991 Indlaw SC 583) and A. Sowkath Ali v. Union of India1304 (2000 Indlaw SC 573) held that if the confession was retracted and the same was not placed before the detaining authority, that is a valid ground to set aside the detention order. The respondent authority should have placed all documents and relevant facts to the notice of the detaining authority and failure to do so would vitiate the detention order.
Hence, we set aside the detention order and the appellant is directed to be released forthwith; if not required in any other matter.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
