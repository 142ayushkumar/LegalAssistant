Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax v Naginjmara Veneer and Sawmills Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

18 December 2002
C.A. No. 2396 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The assessment in respect of Assessment Year 1985-1986 of the respondent assessee had been completed by the appellants on 27-1-1988. Subsequently, a letter was issued to the assessee in which it was said that on the basis of a statement made by the Chief Executive of the respondent Company in the course of the hearing of the assessee's case for Assessment Year 1986-1987, the assessing officer has reasons to believe that the assessee had "suppressed stock" in respect of the accounting year ending on 30-6-1984. The assessee was thereupon requested to show cause why proceedings under Section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short "the Act") should not be initiated against the assessee for Assessment Year 1985-1986 and the profit from the sale of the "suppressed stock" should not be added to the assessee's return income for Assessment Year 1985-1986. The assessee replied to the letter.
2. The Department issued another notice under Section 148 on the basis of the aforesaid letter dated 8-2-1989. The assessee impugned the letter dated 8-2-1989 as well as the notice under Section 148 of the Act issued in respect of Assessment Year 1985-1986 before the High Court under Article 226. The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition and quashed the show-cause notices on the ground that the assessee had disclosed all material particulars before the authorities concerned and that, therefore, there was no basis for the assessing authority to initiate proceedings under Section 148 of the Act. The view of the learned Single Judge was upheld in appeal by the Division Bench of the High Court.
3.  In our view, the High Court has proceeded on erroneous basis not only on the facts but also on the law. The assessee was carrying on the business of production and supply of broad gauge and metre gauge railway sleepers. For the assessment year in question the assessee had received a sum of Rs 44,16,000 from the Forest Utilisation Officer towards the supply of such sleepers which was valued at Rs 88,28,000. During the assessment proceedings in the subsequent assessment year, the Chief Executive of the assessee had said that the advance was made on the basis of actual stock verification by the Forest Utilisation Officer. It was not in dispute that the supply had been effected pursuant to the agreement of the assessee with the Railway Authorities.
4. For Assessment Year 1985-1986 the assessee had disclosed an outstanding liability of Rs 31,58,700 on account of the advance in respect of which no supply had been made. The outstanding advance should have represented the amount of stock remaining with the assessee out of the Actual stock verified at the time of making of the advance. At least this appears to be the basis upon which the assessing authority noted that instead of the aforesaid, in the return of the assessee, the assessee had shown a closing stock of only 2429 sleepers of the total value of Rs 2,41,317.83. The assessing officer therefore stated that he has reasons to believe that the assessee had suppressed stock of BG sleepers, 49,590 pieces at Rs 135 per piece and 5981 pieces of MG sleepers at Rs 59 per piece for the previous year ending 30-6-1984 and sale of 50,000 BG sleepers and 8000 MG sleepers for the previous year ending 30-6-1985.
5.  If what is stated by the Chief Executive Officer is taken to be correct, then there appears to be an unexplained discrepancy between the closing stock as recorded and the stock which should have been there on actual verification of which an advance was made and for which the liability was shown. This statement of the Chief Executive of the assessee had not at all been adverted to by the learned Single Judge or by the Division Bench of the High Court. It is well settled that at the time of considering whether the show-cause notice should be quashed or not, if it is not a question of jurisdiction, the facts as stated in the show-cause notice, must be taken as correct.
6.  Apart from the factual aspect it also appears that the High Court has erred in law and it has overlooked the application of Section 147(6b) of the Act to the case. Section 147(A) as it then stood at the material time read as under:
"147. (b) notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in clause (a) on the part of the assessee, the assessing officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year,"
7.  The assessing officer could assess or reassess such income which has escaped assessment as the case may be for the assessment year concerned subject to the provisions of Sections 148 and 153 of the Act.
8.  In our view, therefore, the High Court erred in quashing the show-cause notice only on the basis of Section 147(a). The show-cause notice must be restored. We make it clear that the assessee's contention that the statement of its Chief Executive was incorrect or in any event has been misunderstood is left open for being decided in the proceedings under
9. Section 148 of the Act as may be commenced on the basis of the impugned notice.
10.  The appeal is allowed. The order of the High Court is set aside. The proceedings under Section 148 of the Act for Assessment Year 1986-1987 are, accordingly, revived. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
