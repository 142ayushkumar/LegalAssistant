1.  The appellant is not represented, though we have waited for some time. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed with no order as to costs.
2. Restored
3. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant. The appellant challenged the validity of s. 44AB of the IT Act, 1961, insofar as it required every person carrying on business, if his total sales, turnover or gross receipts exceeded Rs. 40 lacs, and every person carrying on a profession, if his gross receipts exceeded Rs. 10 lacs, in any previous year
"to get his accounts of such previous year audited by an accountant before the specified date ........". The Explanation to the section defines" Accountant"
4. The challenge is on behalf of the Income-tax Practitioners. It is submitted that they are entitled to be authorised representatives on behalf of the assessees and that excluding them for the purpose of auditing accounts as aforestated violates Arts. 14 and 19 of the Constitution. The High Court in the order under challenge as other High Courts had done, rejected the challenge and, in our view, rightly so.
5. Chartered Accountants, by reason of their training have special aptitude in the matter of audits. It is reasonable that they, who form a class by themselves, should be required to audit the accounts of businesses whose income exceeds Rs. 40 lacs and professionals whose income exceeds Rs. 10 lacs in any given year. There is no material on record, and indeed, in our view, there cannot be, that an Income-tax Practitioner has the same expertise as Chartered Accountants in the matter of accounts. For the same reasons, the challenge under Art. 19 must fail, and it must be pointed out that these Income-tax Practitioners are still entitled to be authorised representatives of assesseesThe appeal is, therefore, dismissed, with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
