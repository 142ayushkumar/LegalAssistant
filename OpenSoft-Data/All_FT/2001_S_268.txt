Shibu Chandra Dhar v Pasupati Nath Auddya
Supreme Court of India

21 November 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO.694 OF 1999
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  It is conceded that the tenant did not deposit the amount of arrears of rent within one month from the date of service of writ of summons under sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956 nor made an application within that time for extension of time under sub section 2(A) and 2(B) of Section 17.
2. An application by tenant, seeking extension of time, made beyond one month, for condoning the delay in deposit which too was made beyond one month, was rejected by the Trial Court but allowed by  the High Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.
3. The High Court, while doing so, relied on an observation made by this Court in M/s. B.P. Khemka Pvt. Ltd.Vs.Birendra Kumar Bhowmick and Anr. reads as under:
"then the court surely has the further discretion to condone the default and extend the time for payment or deposit and such a discretion is a necessary implication of the discretion not to strike out the defence."
4.  We have our reservations about the correctness of the observation so made. The question - whether an application under Section 17 (2A), if filed beyond the period of one month from the date of service of writ of summons would be entertainable, inspite of the bar created by sub-section 2-B, did not specifically arise for decision before this Court in B.P. Khemka's case.
5.  Since B.P.Khemka's case is a two-Judge Bench decision, let the matter be placed for hearing before a three-Judge Bench. At this point of time, learned counsel for the respondent invites attention of the Court to a concession recorded by the High Court at the bottom of its order. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that there is no such concession made as is sought to be spelt out. We do not deem it necessary to express any opinion on either contention.
Order accordingly.
