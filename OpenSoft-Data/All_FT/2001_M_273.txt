Chairman and M.D., Bharat Dynamics Limited and Anr v Mehatab Roy
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11158/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  This Court issued notice on 3.8.2000 in the following terms:-
"Issue notice limited to the question as to why the impugned order of the Division Bench as well as of the Single Judge of the High Court should not be clarified to read that promotion after Grade 'F' is subject to regulations of the Petitioner-Company. Notice shall also be issued on the prayer for interim relief."
2.  Heard Mr.KK Venugopal, learned senior counsel for the appellants and Mr.L.Nageswar Rao, learned senior counsel for the respondent.
3.  This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dated 20.6.2000 in Writ Appeal No.682/2000.
4.  The appellant is the employer and the respondent is the employee. Inasmuch as the respondent has been given promotion from Grade 'E' to Grade 'F' (renamed as WG8) with effect from 2.6.1986 and it is also admitted that pursuant to the order of this Court in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP(C) No.8650/95 dated August 24, 1995 he was also paid wages with effect from August, 1988, the only question that is argued before us is in regard to further promotion of the respondent from Grade 'F' (WG8) to Grade 'I'. We are not inclined to go into this question. Having regard to the facts of the case we consider it appropriate to observe that further promotion of the respondent from Grade 'F' (WG8) to Grade 'I' should be considered in accordance with the Bharat Dynamics Limited Recruitment and Promotion Rules, 1988. If the respondent is found to be entitled to further promotion, he shall be given all the benefits under those Rules. The appeal is accordingly disposed of with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
