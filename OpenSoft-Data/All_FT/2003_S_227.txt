2.  In the said show cause notice the assessing authority did not take note of the situation considered by the Tribunal in this case; whether the assessable value should include the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processor, the value of the job work done and manufacturing expenses of the processor and his profit or the value of the grey cloth in hands of the processor should refer to the value of the full metre length of grey fabrics received by the processor from his customer and not the cost of grey fabrics in the hands of the processor.
3.  None of the authorities has considered that the appellant had no opportunity to put forth his case in this regard.
