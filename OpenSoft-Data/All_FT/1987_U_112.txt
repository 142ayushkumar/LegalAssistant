Nandagopal Saha v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

24 March 1987
W.P. (Criminal) No. 734 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are afraid we have to allow the petition on the sole ground that copies of vital documents were not furnished to the detenu and thereby he was denied a fair opportunity of making a representation. We consider that the statement of Mrs. Jhunu Rani Saha, the statement of the petitioner dated February 19, 1986 and the documents which accompanied handwriting expert's opinion were vital to enable the detenu to make a proper representation.
2.   In that view of the matter, the petitioner is directed to be set at liberty forthwith. The writ petition is allowed accordingly.
Petition allowed.
