The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 9th of February, 2001 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad in Writ Petition No.27838 of 1995 by which the High Court had set aside the judgment of the Special Court dated 29th of September, 1995 in L.G.C. No.72 of 1991.
2.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and examined the materials on record. We are of the view that if an amount of Rs.8,83,000/- is deposited with the appellants by the respondents within 4 weeks from this date, the land of the respondents in respect of which eviction has been sought for by the appellants under the A.P. Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act shall stand regularised and the judgment of the Special court against which the writ petition was preferred before the High Court shall stand set aside and the judgment of the High Court passed in Writ petition No. 27838 of 1995, which is now challenged before us shall stand confirmed. In the event, the amount, as noted above, is not deposited within 4 weeks from this date, the order of the High Court shall stand set aside and this appeal shall stand allowed and the order of the special court dated 29th of September, 1995 in LGC No. 72 of 1991 shall stand confirmed.
3.  The appeal is thus disposed of with the aforesaid direction. There shall be no order as to costs.
