Association of Employees of National Productivity v Chairman, National Productivity Council and
Supreme Court of India

27 March 2009
Civil Appeal No. 2044 of 2009 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 24205 of 2008)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Leave granted. By consent the matter has been taken up for final hearing.
2.  In the case of State of Haryana & Others Vs. Charanjit Singh & Others reported in 2006 (9) SCC 321 2005 Indlaw SC 1245 to which one of us (Hon'ble Kapadia, J.) was a party, it has been held by this Court that the doctrine of "equal pay for equal work" will not apply automatically in every case. In cases where parity of wages is claimed by the workmen, the Management can be directed to constitute what is called as an Equi Valance Committee which will decide the question of parity after examining the nature of work, the nature of responsibility and the hierarchy. This exercise has not been undertaken in this case.
3. Consequently, we are directing the Management to appoint an Expert Committee. Before that Committee, the workmen will appear. They will place all the relevant material before that Committee including the Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company dated 1st November, 1992.
4.  In the meantime, an interim settlement has been entered into between the Management and the workmen. That settlement is taken on record. The settlement will operate till the Equi- Valance Committee decides the question of pay parity.
5.  Accordingly, this civil appeal is disposed of with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of
