Admission Committee and Anr v Institute of Integral Technology and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12541/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The order under challenge was passed pending the disposal of the writ petition filed by the first respondent seeking minority status. It was passed on an application which prayed that the respondent be permitted to admit fifty per cent students recommended by the Management for the year 2000-2001 during the pendency of the writ petition. On this application, the order of the High Court was,
"Till the decision of the Larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the petitioners may admit 50% provisionally from amongst the minority students on merit."
2. Clearly, this order, read with the application for interim relief, was confined to the Academic Year 2000-2001 and, therefore, no interference therewith is called for.
The civil appeal is disposed of accordingly.
No order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
