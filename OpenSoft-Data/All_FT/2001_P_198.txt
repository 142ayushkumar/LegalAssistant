Prithvinath Prasad v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11172/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  Heard counsel for the parties. The grievance of the appellant is that the order dated 3rd August, 1999 was passed by the Joint Commissioner, Commercial Taxes, Patna, Bihar without giving any reasons.
2. There is merit in this submission. Principles of natural justice would have required some reason being given before rejecting an application which had been filed by the appellant.
3.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the impugned order and also the decision dated 3rd August, 1999 of the said Joint Commissioner and direct the Joint Commissioner to dispose of the appellant's representation under Rule 3(4) of the Bihar Sales Tax Rules, 1983 by giving a reasoned order after giving an opportunity to the appellant to represent his case or give a hearing.
Appeal allowed.
