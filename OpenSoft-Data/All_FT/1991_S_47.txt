Shailendra Kumar Gangrade and Another v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 April 1991
W.P. Civil No. 497 of 1990
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. This relates to the appropriate manning of the Madhya Pradesh State Administrative Tribunal set up under the Central Administrative Tribunals Act of 1985. It appears from the affidavit of the State Government that on 23-2-1991, the list of personnel to be appointed to the Tribunal is pending consideration of the Union Government. It further appears from the averments that the vacancies has occurred for more than one year and under the pretext of consultation and resubmission of particulars more than year has been lost.
2. The matter was adjourned from 1-4-1991 to consider the stand of the Union Government in the matter of filling up the vacancies. We have heard the learned Additional Solicitor General today. He states that effective steps have been taken to make the appointments.
3. Since there is no other plea taken by the Union of India and learned Additional Solicitor General says that the papers have been received, we direct that the Tribunal be constituted in accordance with law within four weeks from today, and a compliance affidavit by the Secretary of Personnel be filed in the Registry within three days after that date failing compliance as indicated, steps for contempt shall be taken.
Order accordingly.
