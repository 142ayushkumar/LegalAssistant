National Research Development Corporation v Industrial Carbon and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 October 2000
C.A. No. 6143 of 2000 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (C) No. 8789 of 2000)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  This appeal arises out of an order passed by the High Court of Delhi dated 18-11-1999 refusing to grant further extension under Section 28 of the Arbitration Act, 1940
2.  If we read the proceedings before the arbitrator it is clear that both parties were seeking adjournments. The respondents had taken time on a number of occasions to file their counter. Thereafter the appellant took time to file replication and also for filing affidavit evidence. In fact the matter was dismissed for default twice by the arbitrator and was restored. The arbitrator appears to have been very patient in spite of the number of adjournments taken by both sides. In the circumstances and inasmuch as proceedings went on before the arbitrator beyond 4-5-1995 for nearly two years, we are not inclined to reject the application for extension of time.
3. We, therefore, set aside the order of the High Court and grant extension of time but we limit the time by four months from 20-11-2000, on which day, the parties will appear before the arbitrator. No further time will be made available. It will be for the parties to cooperate and help the arbitrator to pass an order on the merits at an early date. In case any of the parties do not cooperate with the arbitrator it will be open to the arbitrator to take such steps as he may deem fit in accordance with law.
4.  Further in view of the delay by the appellant in moving the High Court we grant extension of time as stated above on condition of the appellant paying to the respondents a sum of Rs. 10, 000 before 20-11-2000. The copy of this order will be sent to Respondent 5 arbitrator.
5.  No further notice need be issued by the arbitrator. The parties will appear before the arbitrator on 20-11-2000.
The appeal is disposed of with costs.
Appeal disposed of.
