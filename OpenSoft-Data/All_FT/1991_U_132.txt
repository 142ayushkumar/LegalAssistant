Union of India v Om Prakash Agarwal and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 October 1991
C.A. Nos. 745-750 of 1978
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals are directed against a Division Bench judgment of the High Court of Gujarat which allowed the appeals of the respondents-employees against the impugned orders of reversion passed by the Railway Administration. We have gone through the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the relevant Rules and Regulations and we do not think that the High Court committed any manifest error in the view that it took in allowing the appeals preferred by the workmen against their reversion. Since then many years have rolled by and the service has stabilised.
We do not see any reason why we should interfere in exercise of power under Article 136 of the Constitution of India when we do not find any manifest error in the view of the High Court.
2.   We, therefore, do not see any merit in these appeals and dismiss them with no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
