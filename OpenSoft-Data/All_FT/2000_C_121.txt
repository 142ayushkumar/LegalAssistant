Supreme Court of India

14 December 2000
C.A. No. 4421-4422 of 2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and in view of the fact that Section 11(A) of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 prior to its amendment in 1992 has been interpreted by the Government itself as meaning that if there is a fraud etc. then the competent authority to issue notice would be the Collector of Central Excise, irrespective of the fact whether the notice is issued within six months or thereafter, shows that at least two interpretations were possible.
2. Therefore, the one favouring the assessee must prevail especially when in 1992 there has been an amendment to the Statute. Furthermore, the construction put on Section 11(A) is in line with the decision of this Court in the case of Collector of Central Excise Vs. Oil and Natural Gas Commission 1998 Indlaw SC 857.
The appeals are dismissed. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
