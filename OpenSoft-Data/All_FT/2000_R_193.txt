Commissioner of Income Tax v Ratnam Poultry Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

11 August 2000
C.A. No. 4554 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Two questions were proposed by the Revenue for reference to the High Court for consideration. They read thus:
"1. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was correct in law in holding that the sale of eggs and birds by the assessee constitutes income of an industrial undertaking for the purpose of allowing deductions under ss. 80HH and 80-I of IT Act.
(2) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal has erred in law in treating the poultry sheds as 'Plant' and allowing a higher rate of depreciation."
2.  The High Court declined to order the reference and the Revenue is in appeal.
3.  The first question is now covered by the decision of this Court in CIT vs. Venkateswara Hatcheries (P) Ltd. 1999 Indlaw SC 11951999 Indlaw SC 1195The second question may not be so covered. It is, therefore, appropriate to direct the Tribunal to refer both questions to the High Court. The High Court may answer the first in the manner stated above and consider the second question.
4.  Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The Tribunal shall now make a reference to the High Court of the two questions, set out above. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
