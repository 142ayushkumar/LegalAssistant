Municipal Council, Jind & Ors. v Virender Pal
Supreme Court of India

17 July 2008
CIVIL APPEAL NO.207 OF 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Since the notice was issued to show cause why the direction for payment of full back wages be not set aside or modified, learned counsel for the respondent draws our attention to the award passed by the Labour Court and submits that the appellant is liable to pay a sum of Rs. 2,40,322/-.
2. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we feel that instead of awarding entire 100% back wages as aforesaid, this appeal shall be disposed of by directing the appellant to pay a sum of Rs.1,20,000/- which shall be paid within six months from the date of communication of this order. With this modification, the appeal is disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
