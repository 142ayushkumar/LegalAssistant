15.  This appeal is directed against the impugned direction of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in relation to a dealership in LPG at Manthani in Karimnagar. The dealership in question had been granted by the concerned Minister under a discretionary quota which stood annulled by the High Court. Pursuant to the direction of the High Court to have an auction for the dealership in question, an auction was held on 3.3.1999 after the same was advertised in newspaper 'Deccan Chronical' on 02.02.1999.
16. The reserve price fixed was Rs.4.61 lakhs. The present appellant was the highest bidder who had offered Rs.5.11 lakhs and the bid had been knocked down in favour of the appellant whereafter the appellant started his business.
17.  Respondent no.1 filed a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court praying for cancellation of the dealership in favour of the appellant alleging inter alia that the so-called auction that was held on 03.03.1999 had not been duly conducted and the said respondent was prevented from participating as a result of which the largesse in question did not fetch the proper price and even though he is prepared to offer Rs. 40 lakhs the same has been settled with the appellant for a paltry sum of Rs.5.11 lakhs.
18.  The learned Single Judge having been persuaded to accept the contention raised by the respondent in the writ petition and being of the opinion that in fact it would fetch Rs. 40 lakhs, directed reauction of the dealership keeping the reserve price at Rs. 40 lakhs. The learned Single Judge also directed the respondent (the writ petitioner) to deposit a sum of Rs. 40 lakhs to prove his bonafides. The appellant assailed the order by filing an appeal to the Division Bench.While the appeal was pending before the Division Bench it passed an order dated 30.11.2000 calling upon the respondent no.2 to deposit Rs. 40 lakhs before the Registrar of the Court within a week from the date of the order. While passing the aforesaid order the Division Bench was aware of the fact that a sum of Rs.40 lakhs is said to have been deposited in Andhra Bank, Karimnagar Branch. It was stated in the order dated 30.11.2000 that on deposit of Rs.40 lakhs, it would be open for the respondent to move the Court for appropriate order in respect of conducting of auction with regard to the leasehold right to carry on the business in LPG dealership at Manthani.
19. This order of the Division Bench dated 30.11.2000 appears to have not been complied with even by the date the appeal was finally disposed of. The Division Bench however thought it appropriate that in the larger interest of justice, the appeal could be disposed of with certain directions and directed that the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) shall hold a fresh auction in relation to the dealership in question.
20.  Apart from the aforesaid direction, there were certain other directions also in the impugned order of the Division Bench. It is true that respondent no.1 deposited a sum of Rs. one lakh pursuant to one of the directions of the aforesaid Court. But Mr. Ram Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, contended that the Division Bench is not justified in directing re-auction of the largesse when the respondent did not comply with the interim direction dated 30.11.1998 in not depositing the entire sum of Rs. 40 lakhs within a week with the Registrar of that Court. The learned Single Judge as well as the learned Division Bench were having this exercise to have a greater amount for the largesse in question without even coming to a conclusion that the auction has not been bonafide held.From the narration of facts as already stated, the minimum reserve price fixed under the advertisement being Rs.4.61 lakhs and the appellant having given the highest bid of Rs. 5.11 lakhs it cannot be said, on the face of it, not to be a bonafide transaction.
21. There has been no finding of the learned Division Bench that the respondent was prevented from auction. In exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court was not required to go into this question of fact and once the High Court set aside an auction in favour of the highest bidder on the ground that it could fetch a higher amount, ordinarily, one would expect that the terms and conditions of the High Court must be complied with by the person at whose behest an auction, which has received the finality, would be annulled. Since the respondent did not deposit the sum of Rs. 40 lakhs even though directed by the High Court in its order dated 30.11.2000, the Division Bench was not entitled to direct a fresh auction of the largesse in question and it would have been more appropriate for the Division Bench to affirm the auction in favour of the appellant who, admittedly, was the highest bidder and had been operating the LPG connections on payment of the amount for which he had bid at the auction.
22.  The direction of the Division Bench to re-auction with the terms and conditions contained in the order, in our opinion, was wholly unjustified and, at any rate, such direction could not have been issued at the behest of the respondent who had filed the writ petition when the said respondent did not deposit the sum of Rs. 40 lakhs with the Registrar of the Court pursuant to the order dt. 30.11.2000. The respondent was not entitled to the discretion of the Court to be exercised in his favour, he having failed to comply with the direction of the Court notwithstanding the fact that he had deposited a sum of Rs. 40 lakhs with the Andhra Bank, Karimnagar Branch.
23. In our considered opinion, the impugned direction of the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court requiring re-auction cannot be sustained. So also, the direction of the learned Single Judge in annulling the auction in favour of the appellant. We, therefore, set aside the direction of the learned Single Judge in the writ petition as well as the direction of the Division Bench in appeal and allow this appeal. The auction that had been already settled in favour of the appellant is affirmed.
Appeal allowed.
