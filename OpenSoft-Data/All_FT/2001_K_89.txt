Kalpana and Anr v Kumud and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1904-1906/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We do not find any necessity to transfer the case from Hoshangabad District to Berhampur District, for, the cases were transferred earlier to Hoshangabad District at the behest of the petitioner. The difficulty for the petitioner/petitioners to appear now before Hoshangabad District could be alleviated by permitting the petitioner to apply for exemption from appearance.
2.  If any such application is filed, the trial court shall exempt their physical appearance on the following conditions:
1) A counsel on behalf of the petitioners would be present in the Court whenever their case is taken up;
2) The petitioners will not dispute their identity as the accused in the case;
3) The petitioners will be present in the Court when such presence is imperatively needed.
The SLPs are disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
