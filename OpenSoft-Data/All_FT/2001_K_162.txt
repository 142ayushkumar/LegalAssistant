Dhaja Ram v Kashi Ram (D) By Lrs
Supreme Court of India

24 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11703/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant herein filed a writ petition in the High Court. It appears that respondent No. 3 died on 20th May, 1998. However, an application for substitution was filed on 12th August, 1999 alongwith an application for condonation of delay. The High Court rejected the application for condonation of delay. Consequently, the application for substitution also stood rejected. In that view of the matter, the writ petition was held to have been abated. It is against the said order of the High Court, the appellant has filed this appeal by way of special leave petition.
2. We have heard counsel for the parties and looked into the record. We are satisfied that the cause shown by the appellant for condonation of delay was sufficient.
3.  After condoning the delay and setting aside the order of abatement, we allow the application for substitution and direct the High Court to decide the writ petition on merits.
4.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
