State of Jammu and Kashmir v Mukhtar Hussain Naqshbandi and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3347/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
2.  This Court issued notice limited to the question as to why the case should not be remanded to the High Court for deciding the matter on merits. After perusal of the record, we find that the appellant has made out a sufficient cause for condonation of delay in filing the appeal.
3. We, therefore, set aside the order and judgment under appeal and after condoning the delay send the case back to the Division Bench of the High Court to decide the matter on merits.
4.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
