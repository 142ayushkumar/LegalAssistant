Rajasthan Financial Corporation and another v Official Liquidator and another
Supreme Court of India

30 August 2005
C.A. No(s). 4055 of 1998 with C.A. No. 5382 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Keeping in view the apparent conflict between the two Judge Bench decision of this Court in Allahabad Bank vs. Canara Bank & Another [2000 (4) SCC 406 2000 Indlaw SC 492] and the subsequent decision in International Coach Builders Ltd. Vs. Karnataka State Financial Corporation [2003 (10) SCC 482 2003 Indlaw SC 1503] as also having regard to the importance of the question of law involved, we deem it appropriate that the matters be placed before a larger bench after obtaining orders from the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India.
It may be noted that the latter judgment does not take notice of the former judgment.
Order accordingly
