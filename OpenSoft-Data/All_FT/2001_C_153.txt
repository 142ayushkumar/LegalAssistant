Ramsingh Nigwal v Chief Secretary, M.P. Government and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14639/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is contended that if the time taken in the disposal of the miscellaneous application filed by the petitioner for recalling the order made by the learned Single Judge is taken into account and deduction is given for the same in the period of limitation in filing the LPA, there would be no delay in the appeal filed by the appellant before the LPA bench. If this contention be correct then, in our opinion, this petition may have to be remanded back to the appellate bench for disposal on merits.
2. Hence, issue a limited notice why this petition be not remanded for fresh disposal on the above grounds.
Order accordingly.
