Kundan Singh v State of Punjab
Supreme Court of India

20 April 1981
Cri. Appeal No. 444 of 1981
The Judgment was delivered by: BHAGWATI, J.
We are of the view that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the present case and particularly in view of the fact that P.W. 6 and P.W. 7 were in the courtyard of their house when the appellant fired gun shots and he could not, therefore, have intended to injure them, the conviction of the appellant under S. 307, I.P.C. was not justified.
1. We think that the conviction of the appellant could be maintained only under S. 324 of the I.P.C. since P.W. 6 and P.W. 7 received simple injuries. We accordingly allow the appeal and alter the conviction of the appellant to one under S. 324 of the I.P.C. for causing simple injuries to P.W. 6 and P.W. 7 and since the appellant for about 16 months, we direct that the sentence imposed on the appellant be reduced to that already undergone by him and he may be set liberty forthwith.
Appeal allowed.
