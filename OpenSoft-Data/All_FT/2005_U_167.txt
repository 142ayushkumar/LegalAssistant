Pondicherry L and Rmmdcw Assn. v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

5 August 2005
S.L.Ps. (C) No. 15167 of 2005 with No. 15293 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
SLP (C) No. 15167 of 2005
The special leave petition is dismissed.
SLP (C) No. 15293 of 2005
Application for impleadment is allowed.
1.  By a separate order, we have dismissed SLP (C) No. 15167 of 2005. The effect of dismissal of the said petition is that the Pondicherry Linguistic and Religious Minority Medical and Dental College Welfare Association is not permitted to conduct a separate entrance examination at this stage. Therefore, the admissions shall have to be made on the basis of the test conducted by the Government of Pondicherry. In that view, the aspect of two different tests does not arise and thus no further clarification, as noticed in the impugned judgment, is required.
2.  Our attention has been drawn by the learned Solicitor General to a letter dated 28-7-2005 sent by the Government Pleader to the Secretary (Health), Pondicherry, reproducing therein the order of the High Court, inter alia, to the effect that there shall be an order of interim injunction as well as interim stay as prayed for subject to the orders to be passed by this Court in the pending SLP (C) No. 15167 of 2005. Since we have already disposed of SLP (C) No. 15167 of 2005, it would be for the parties to approach the High Court for necessary relief.
The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
