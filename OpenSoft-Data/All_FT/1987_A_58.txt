Aruna Shankar v State of Uttar Pradesh and Another
Supreme Court of India

20 January 1987
W.P. No. 1148 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. This writ petition is dismissed as no relief can be granted to him but we feel that some inquiry should be made into the question whether the petitioner is really harassed by the local police. We find that a large number of cases have been instituted against the petitioner but every one of them has resulted either in discharge or acquittal. There appears to be something wrong somewhere.
2. The Director General of Police, U.P., may direct a proper inquiry to be made by an officer of the Intelligence Branch of U.P. Police. A copy of the writ petition will be forwarded to the Director General of Police, U.P.
Petition dismised.
