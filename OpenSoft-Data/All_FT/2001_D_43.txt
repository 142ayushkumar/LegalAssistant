State of Haryana v Darshan Singh
Supreme Court of India

17 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8195/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
We have heard the counsel for the parties.
1.  In our opinion, in the special circumstances of the case even if the workman was directed to be reinstated, this was not a fit case where any back wages should have been awarded, especially in view of the fact that it is not known conclusively whether the respondent had abandoned his work or there was a case of termination. Giving the benefit of doubt to the respondent, he is reinstated in service with all consequential benefits except the benefit of back wages.
This appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Appeal disposed of.
