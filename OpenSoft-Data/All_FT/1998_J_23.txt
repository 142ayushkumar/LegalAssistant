Jagriti Upbhogta Kalyan Parishad and Others v U.O.I. and Others
Supreme Court of India

18 September 1998
Writ Petn. (Civil) No. 758 of 1996 With I.A. No. 12
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On 28th August, 1998 taking serious note of the manner in which Shri V. K. Tewari was avoiding his appearance before the District Judge, Amreli, a direction was issued to him to appear before the Court of District Judge, Amreli on any date between 7th and 9th September, 1998 to file his affidavit and to identify the properties at Pipavov Port which had been directed to be attached by order of this Court dated 14th May, 1998. It was also directed that since the efforts of the police to secure the presence of Shri V. K. Tewari had not been successful, he should appear in this Court on the next date of hearing i.e. today. Shri V. K. Tewari is not present in Court despite the directions issued, as noticed above. Instead, an application being I.A. 12 of 1998 has been filed by him seeking extension of time for appearance before the District Judge, Amreli. The prayer made in the application is to extend the time for a week from 9th September, 1998 to enable him to appear before the District Judge, Amreli. The application is supported by an affidavit which was verified on 9th September, 1998 at New Delhi. No. exemption from appearance in this Court has been sought.
2. We fail to understand why Shri V. K. Tewari could not appear before the District Judge, Amreli between 7th and 9th September, 1998, when he was, on his own showing, present in Delhi on 9th September, 1998. It appears that he is deliberately avoiding his appearance and is taking liberties with the Court. His absence today from the Court despite directions issued to him also appears to be a deliberate act on his part to stay away.
3.  We view his conduct with concern. We, direct that the presence of Shri V. K. Tewari shall be secured by issuance of non-bailable warrants returnable on 24th September, 1998. The matter shall be listed at 2.00 p.m. on 24th September, 1998 along with I.A. No. 12 of 1998.
Order accordingly.
