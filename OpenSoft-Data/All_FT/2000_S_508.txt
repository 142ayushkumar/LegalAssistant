Hemant Bhimappa Gadivaddar v State of Karnataka
Supreme Court of India

2 August 2000
Cr.A. No. 266 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is a right of appeal of the accused as the High Court has reversed an acquittal. We appointed Mr. R. K. Maheshwari, Advocate as amicus curiae. He must be supplied with copies of the relevant documents to enable him to study the case and address arguments. The Registry will supply the copies of all the relevant documents by the next posting date.
2.  Learned counsel for the State of Karnataka candidly confessed that he is not in possession of the papers for addressing arguments. He is unable to give any explanation why the State has not supplied such papers to him. This is not the only case in which the State of Karnataka is a party wherein such serious lapse is seen. In most of the cases filed by prisoners against that State we have noticed the same position.
3. We, therefore, direct the Law Secretary of the State of Karnataka to be present before this Court on the next posting date to explain to the Court why is there no system in the State to make the papers available to the State counsel in the Supreme Court. List on 22-8-2000.
Order accordingly.
