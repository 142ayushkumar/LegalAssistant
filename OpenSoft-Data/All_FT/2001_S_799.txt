B. Krishna Bhat v State of Karnataka and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.2028/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It was proposed that the Government servants and the other functionaries entitled to treatment at the expense of the State should only be treated in the Government hospitals and nowhere else. There seems to be some merit in this contention.
2. The State Government will inform the Court on the next date of hearing when rules to this effect are going to be made whereby it will be compulsory for all such functionaries to be treated in these hospitals only. Affidavit in response to this will be filed by the Chief Secretary within four weeks. To come up after four weeks.
Order accordingly.
