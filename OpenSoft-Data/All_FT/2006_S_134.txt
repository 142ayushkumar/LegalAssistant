Sham Singh and others v State of Punjab
Supreme Court of India

23 February 2006
Cr.A. No. 430 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In the present case, the appellants have been awarded minimum sentence of seven years under Section 304-B of the Penal Code. Though the leave was granted on the quantum of sentence, but in view of the fact that the court has awarded minimum punishment prescribed under law, it would not be possible to give any relief to the appellants.
2. The appeal fails and the same is, accordingly, dismissed. Bail bonds of the appellants, who are on bail, are cancelled and they are directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence, if any.
Appeal dismissed.
