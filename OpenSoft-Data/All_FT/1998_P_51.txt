Managing Committee, Sri Lakshmi N.A. College and Another v Prem Chand and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 January 1998
S.L.P. (C) No. 8805 of 1998 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 13 January 1998 in C.W.P. No. 9077 of 1997 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh), Dt. 12 January 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this S.L.P., one important question arises for consideration whether the petitioner Management is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and whether it is amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court.
2. According to learned counsel for the petitioners, this question is answered in favour of the petitioner's own institution by a judgment of a two-Judge Bench of this Court in CA No. 3055 of 1991 decided on 17-1-1998. That decision certainly helps the petitioners. However, learned counsel for Respondent 1 submits that Respondent 1 was not a party to those proceedings so that the judgment may not be res judicata. He has submitted that the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court which was not noticed in that judgment takes a contrary view.
3.  The decision on which reliance is placed is rendered by a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Unnikrishnan, J.P. v. State of A.P.  1993 Indlaw SC 1056  Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the observation of Justice Mohan in the said judgment supports his contention. On the contrary, learned counsel for Respondent 1 submits that the view taken by Justice Mohan supports his contention.
4. In our view, this controversy may be better resolved by a three-Judge Bench of this Court as sitting in the Bench consisting of two Judges it will not be proper for us to consider the question whether the decision rendered by this Court in C.A. No. 3055 of 1991 is correct or not. This S.L.P. is therefore directed to be listed before a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court.
5.  We make it clear that the entire S.L.P. is placed for consideration. Office is directed to obtain appropriate direction from the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India in this connection.
Order accordingly.
