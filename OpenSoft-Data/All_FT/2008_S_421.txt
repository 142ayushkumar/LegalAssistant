Kashimath Samsthan & Anr v Srimadh Sudhindra Thirtha Swamy
Supreme Court of India

14 February 2008
Appeal (civil) 6312 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This appeal is directed against an interim order granted by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in CRP No. 1641/2001. On 10th September, 2001, while granting leave in the S.L.P., the following interim order was passed by this court:
"Meanwhile the judgment under challenge shall remain stayed. However, if the respondent has any apprehension regarding embezzlement of fund or want to worship the deity or further safeguard of the deity, it will be open to him to move the trial court."
2. The learned counsel appearing for the parties submitted before us that the pending suit, in respect of which the interim order was granted and stayed by this court on 10th of September, 2001 is likely to be disposed of within a period of 2 months from this date.
3.  Since the interim order, which was challenged in this appeal and stay of that interim order was granted by the court on 10th of September, 2001, is continuing even today, we feel it proper to dispose of this appeal by directing the trial court to dispose of the pending suit within two months from the date of supply of a copy of this order to the trial court where the suit is now pending without granting any unnecessary adjournment to either of the parties.
4.  The interim order that was passed on 10th of September, 2001 and is continuing shall continue for a further period of 4 months from this date or till the disposal of the suit, whichever is earlier.
5. The appeal is thus disposed of without any order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of
