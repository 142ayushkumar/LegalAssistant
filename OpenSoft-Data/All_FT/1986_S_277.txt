The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  Shri O. P. Rana, learned counsel for the U.P. State Transport Undertaking submits that in view of the delay between the date of the publication of Section 68-C of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 and the date on which the Scheme was approved by the Authority under Section 68-D it may be reasonable to increase the number of buses plying on the route in question and the number of trips they have to make in the interest of the general public. He submits that the State Transport Undertaking is willing to take action under Section 68-E of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 immediately so that the interest of the public is protected.
2.   We, therefore, direct the State Transport Undertaking to publish a proposal to modify the Scheme in an appropriate manner under Section 68-B of the Act on or before January 10, 1987. The persons who are interested in making their representations to the proposal shall file their representation within 30 days of the publication of the said proposal to modify the Scheme in the gazette and in the local papers. The hearing authority shall complete the hearing on or before April 15, 1987. The procedure which has to be followed under Section 60-E shall be followed strictly and orders may be passed in accordance with law on or before April 30, 1987. Post these cases for hearing in the first week of May 1987. In the meanwhile status quo will continue.
3.  All the permits which had been issued under Section 68-F(I-C) or 68-F(I-A) have come to an end on the date on which the approved Scheme was published.
4.  The CMP Nos. 30478/86, 30482/86, 31030/86 and 30437/86 filed by Shri Yogeshwar Prasad will come up on hearing on January 8, 1987.
