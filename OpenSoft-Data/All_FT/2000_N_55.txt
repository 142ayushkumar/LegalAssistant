Nathi Devi v Radha Devi Gupta
Supreme Court of India

1 February 2000
C.A. No. 5027 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are concerned with the interpretation of Section 14-D of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. Sub-section (1) thereof reads as follows:
"14-D. Right to recover immediate possession of premises to accrue to a widow. - (1) Where the landlord is a widow and the premises let out by her, or by her husband, are required by her for her own residence, she may apply to the Controller for recovering the immediate possession of such premises."
2.  Specifically the issue is in relation to the meaning of the words" let out". Do they mean the creation of a fresh tenancy or do they refer to an existing tenancy ? If the former, the section can be resorted to only by the creator of the tenancy (widow or her late husband). If it is the latter, even a transferee (widow) is entitled to invoke it. We find that there is some conflict in the views taken by two Benches of three learned Judges each. An observation in the judgment in Surjit Singh Kalra v. Union of India 1991 Indlaw SC 1057 suggests that the words "let out" refer only to the creation of a tenancy.
3.  On the other hand, the judgment in Kanta Goel v. B. P. Pathak 1977 Indlaw SC 46 interprets the words "let out" in the context of Section 14-D of the Act to mean that even a transferee landlord can invoke the provision.
4.  It is, in these circumstances, necessary that this appeal should be heard by a Bench of five learned Judges. It shall be so placed after obtaining the directions of the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India in this regard.
Order accordingly.
