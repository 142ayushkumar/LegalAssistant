Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi v Bengal National Textiles Mills Limited
Supreme Court of India

29 July 1997
C.A. No. 2596 of 1988, (Arising as an appeal from 1988 (35) E.L.T. 681 (Tribunal) and see also 1996 (84) E.L.T. A171.)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is clear from the judgment of the Tribunal [The Appellate Tribunal in its impugned order by a majority of 2 : 1 had held that Acrylic hand knitting yarn produced by shrinkage at different levels of constituent fibres is classifiable as bulk yarn under the then Tariff Item 18(ii) of the erstwhile Central Excise Tariff.The Tribunal further held that the demand under Section 11A of the Central Excise Act in terms of the revised Classification List is enforceable only from the date of Show Cause Notice and not for the earlier period when clearances were effected in pursuance to an approved Classification List.] that the Revenue's claim of classification of yarn in question under Item 18(ii) CET, as it stood at the relevant time, has been upheld but the demand of duty for the period prior to the date of the show cause notice has been held to be not enforceable. There is no ambiguity in the Tribunal's order requiring any classification, for which purpose alone this appeal was admitted.
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
