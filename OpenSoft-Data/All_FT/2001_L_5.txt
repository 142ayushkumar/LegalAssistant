L.I.C. and Anr v Dipali Gupta and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 November 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2225/1999
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  This appeal arises out of certain execution proceedings in which it was claimed that third respondent is entitled to an appointment on compassionate ground in as much as his father is presumed to have died while in harness.
2.  In as much as, the judgment and decree of the trial Court had not been challenged and that had become final and the High Court having properly interpreted that particular judgment, we do not think any useful purpose will be served by examining various questions raised in this appeal.
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
