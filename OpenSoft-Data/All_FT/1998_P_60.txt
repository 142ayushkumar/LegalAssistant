Prime Channel and Another v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 April 1998
IA No. 4 in C.A. No. 16833 of 1996
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we modify clause 3 of the terms indicated in the order of this Court dated 11-12-1996 because this Court was given to understand that the amount mentioned in clause 3 was similar to the terms which were made available to the serial "Om Namah Shivay". As it appears to us from the letter dated 7-4-1997 addressed to M/s. Creative Eye Limited in respect of the telecast of the serial "Om Namah Shivay" that for the first 13 episodes, minimum guarantee would be Rs. 37.08 lakhs (including telecast fee) with 840 seconds of commercial time (including admissible FCT of 210 seconds) and for the 14th episode up to the end, the minimum guarantee would be Rs. 46.05 lakhs per episode (including telecast fee) with 840 seconds of commercial time (including admissible FCT of 210 seconds).
2.  Clause 3 of the terms contained in the order dated 11-12-1996 is modified by indicating that for the first 13 episodes of "Chandrakanta" which will be telecast for Doordarshan 1 after the four recapitulating episodes the minimum guarantee would be Rs. 37.08 lakhs (gross) per episode (including telecast fee) for 840 seconds of commercial time (including admissible FCT of 210 seconds) and from 14th episode up to 58 episodes, minimum guarantee will be Rs. 46.05 lakhs (gross) (including telecast fee) with 840 seconds of commercial time (including admissible FCT of 210 seconds). So far as the bank facilities are concerned, the same term which is made available to "Om Namah Shivay" will be made available to the telecast of the serial "Chandrakanta". The application is accordingly disposed of.
Application disposed of.
