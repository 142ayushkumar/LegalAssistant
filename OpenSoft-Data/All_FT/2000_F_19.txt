Kulwant Rai Berry (Dead) By Lrs. and Others v Financial Commissioner and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 January 2000
Review Petition (C) No. 1476 of 1999 (In S.L.P. (C) No. 18572 of 1998)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  289 days' delay is not satisfactorily explained. Hence, the review petition is liable to be dismissed on that ground alone. However, we have also considered the merits of the review petition. No ground is made out by the review petitioners for showing any patent error underlying the impugned order sought to be reviewed.
2.    Whether the petitioners were in possession of the land in question was a pure question of fact which could not have been interfered with in a writ petition by the High Court much less by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.
3.    The review petition is therefore, dismissed on the ground of limitation as well as on merits.
Review dismissed.
