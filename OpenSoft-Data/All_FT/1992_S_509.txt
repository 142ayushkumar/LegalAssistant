Mohd. Musa Mia Alias Mohd. Musa v State of W. B
Supreme Court of India

13 February 1992
Cr.A. No. 299 of 1990
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have gone through the judgment and the connected records. The appellant who stands convicted along with Pradip Sen under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC is stated to have caught hold of the deceased while Pradip Sen gave a knife blow and thereafter the appellant also gave a knife blow on the person of the deceased. Leave was granted only on the nature of offence and question of sentence.
2.  The only argument advanced before us by the learned counsel is that the conviction of the appellant cannot be sustained with the aid of Section 34 IPC since the facts and circumstances of the case do not spell out that this appellant had shared the intention of Pradip Sen in causing the death of the deceased. We are unable to countenance the argument advanced by the learned counsel.
3.   In fact the appellant went to the scene spot with a knife and caught hod of the deceased in order to facilitate Pradip Sen to stab the deceased and thereafter the appellant also stabbed the deceased with a knife which he had carried with him. Under these circumstances, we hold that this appellant had shared the intention of Pradip Sen in murdering the deceased.
4.  In the result, we are in full agreement with the judgment of the High Court and the convection recorded by the courts with aid of Section 34 for the offence of murder does not call for interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
