First Leasing Company of India Limited and Anr v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 November 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. It is contended by Mr. Nariman, learned Senior counsel that even though the assessment in the instant case may be in line with the decision of the Constitution Bench in 20th Century Finance Corporation vs. State of Maharashtra, the difficulty which arises, as far as the petitioners are concerned, is that on the basis of various High Court decisions sales tax has been paid in different States with regard to the same transaction which is sought to be taxed in the State of Tamil Nadu.
2. He contends that the problem can perhaps be solved by a declaration to the effect that the decision in 20th Century's case (supra) should be applicable prospectively and in this connection he relies upon the decision of this Court in Waman Rao and Ors. vs. Union of India and Ors. which declares the cut off date in Kesavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala to be prospective.
3.  Issue notice, returnable after four weeks. Dasti notice, in addition, permitted.
4.  On the petitioners furnishing bank guarantee for the balance amount of tax within two weeks, realisation of balance amount is stayed.
Order accordingly.
