K.L. Venugopal v K.R. Ananda and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19343/2000
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. We find that the High Court has not adjudicated the controversy in the right prespectives. Various points raised have not been adjudicated. The questions at what point of time the acquisition came to an end what is the period during which the restraint order was in operation and as to when the alienation has taken place which constituted the violation are relevant questions for consideration.
2.  In this case we find it is not here. Accordingly the impugned order is not sustainable and is hereby quashed. The impguned order is set aside. The matter is sent back to the High Court for disposing of the same afresh after notice to the parties.
3. The matter may be disposed of within eight weeks from the date of the receipt of the copy of this order by the High Court.
Order accordingly.
