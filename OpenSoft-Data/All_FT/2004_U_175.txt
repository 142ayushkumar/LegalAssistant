Supreme Court of India

9 August 2004
W.P. (C) No. 194 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The present writ petition is filed by the petitioners alleging that the petitioners are not employees and there is no employer employee relationship and hence the petitioners are not coming within the purview of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.
2.  The counsel for the petitioners submits that all the questions raised by the petitioners were not considered in the previous judgment dated 18-3-1999 in Civil Appeal No. 7247 of 1993 .
3. The counsel for the petitioner also submits that review petition against the judgment was filed but the same was dismissed on the ground of delay.Hence they filed the present writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution.
4.  As the Court has taken a view earlier, we are not inclined to entertain the petition under Article 32 filed by the petitioner. The writ petition is dismissed without prejudice to other rights, if any, of the petitioners to move for any other appropriate forum to redress the grievances of the petitioners.
Petition dismissed.
