Chattisghar Krishak Mazdoor Sangh v State of Madhya Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 December 1986
W.P. No. 13300 of 1983.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The 678 persons who were identified as bonded labourers by the Commissioner appointed by this Court were directed to be released and provision for their rehabilitation was also ordered. Compliance report with this order has been furnished.
2.  The only direction asked for by Mr. Verghese now is that he should have an opportunity to file a fresh list of the remaining persons before the Deputy Collector, Saraipalli in Madhya Pradesh who is the appropriate authority and the matter should be disposed of on the principles indicated by this Court. For that State agrees that identification will be made by the officers concerned and as and when they are identified as bonded labourers order for release as also rehabilitation as per the scheme shall be made.
3.   Since Mr. Verghese has undertaken to file a list within fifteen days we direct that identification be made within three months from the date of filing of the list and orders relating to the persons in the list be passed immediately thereafter with appropriate certificates entitling them for rehabilitation. As fresh persons are also said to have been found such additional list may be furnished to the authority of such persons and if such a list is given then similar procedure be adopted. No useful purpose will be served to keep this matter alive before us; we dispose of the matter with this observation.
4.  If the Commissioner has any dues to be paid it will be open to him, to write to the Registrar of this Court.
Order accordingly.
