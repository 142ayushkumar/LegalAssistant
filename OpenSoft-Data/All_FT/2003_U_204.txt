University of Delhi and Another v T.P.S. Chawla and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 October 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Civil) No.18024-18026/2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Permission to file Special Leave Petition is granted.
Delay condoned.
Leave granted in all the Special Leave Petitions.
Heard parties.
1.  These appeals are against an interim order passed by the High Court. We modify the interim order to the following extent:
2.  Pending disposal of the writ petition, the University and Colleges would be entitled to re-employ on the basis of Ordinance XII Rule 3-A (2). But it is clarified that such re-employment is not to be in a routine manner, of almost all teachers. The mere fact that a teacher has served for a long period does not by itself makes him a distinguished teacher. For this Ordinance to apply, there must be outstanding merit in the teacher. The revised guidelines issued by the University of Delhi and the guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission must be strictly followed. Reasons must be recorded as to how and why the person being re-employed is a distinguished teacher.
3.  We further direct that at the time of re-employment it shall be clarified to the teacher that the re-employment is subject to the result of the writ petition. Every teacher who is re-employed must give an undertaking to Court that in the event of the High Court ultimately holding that such person was not entitled to re-employment he/she shall repay all the salary and benefits (including perks) which have been received by him/her in the meantime.
4.  In the event, it is found that the re-employment is not strictly in accordance with the Ordinance, liberty to apply for variation of this Order.
The appeals stand disposed of. No order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
