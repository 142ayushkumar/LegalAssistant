Icici Bank Limited v State of Gujarat and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...CC 8237/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Permission to file SLP is granted.
Heard counsel for the parties at length.
1.  It is not disputed that the High Court is seized with the matter. The directions that are impugned in these petitions are interlocutory in nature and final order would be passed after the matter is inquired into and heard after giving opportunity to the persons who are likely to be affected by our order that may be passed finally.
2. We are, therefore, not inclined to interfere with the direction Nos. 1, 2, 4, 6 to 13. So far direction Nos. 3 and 5 are concerned, they would remain suspended till the matter is heard and final order is passed by the High Court.
3.  However, so far direction No. 3 is concerned, the building may not be sealed, but the owners of such building shall not use the building for commercial purposes hereafter. We are also of the view that the High Court may direct for sending notices to those persons who are likely to be adversely affected by supplying the materials which it seeks to rely, if not send already. This order of ours suspending direction Nos. 3 and 5 shall ceased to have effect as and when any final order is passed by the High Court.
4.  Further it may be clarified that this order shall not come in the way of the High Court in passing any order that it may deem fit in the facts and circumstances of the case.
With these directions special leave petitions are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
