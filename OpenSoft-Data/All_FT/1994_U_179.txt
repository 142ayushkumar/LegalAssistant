Civil Appeal No. 1773 of 1994
Leave granted.
This appeal is on behalf of the Union of India, against an order dated october 7, 1988 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Allahabad (hereinafter referred to as the 'Tribunal').
Respondent retired from the service on July 31, 1979. He filed an application before the Tribunal for a direction that an option be given in terms of the Office Memorandum No. F-19(4)-E.V./79 dated May 25, 1979, even to those who retired between April 30, 1979 and January 30, 1982. A grievance was made that in terms of the aforesaid Office Memorandum, option could be exercised only by persons, who retired on or after September 30, 1977 but not later than April 30, 1979.
1. The Tribunal allowed the said application. During the hearing of the present appeal, we were informed that by a later order, the period of exercising the option has been extended up to February 1, 1982. The validity of the Office Memorandum No. F-19(4)-E.V./79 dated May 25, 1979 has been examined in detail in Civil Appeal No. 517 of 1987 (Union of India v. P.N. Menon1 1994 Indlaw SC 2079) disposed of today. Any grievance made on behalf of the respondent, in respect of the said Office Memorandum shall be examined, in terms of the judgment in the aforesaid appeal. In that view of the matter, hardly anything survives requiring any order or direction by this Court.
2. Accordingly, the appeal is disposed of in terms of the judgment delivered today in Civil Appeal No. 517 of 1987. There will be no order as to costs.
