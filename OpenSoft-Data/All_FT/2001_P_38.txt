P.Kandasamy v Supdt. of Police and Anr
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2944-2945/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The present appeals are directed against the revisional order of the High Court of Madras in Crl.R.C.No.419/99 and Crl. Misc.Petition No.3435/99. The High Court disposed of the revision by directing the appellant to deposit Rs. 1,00,000/- within a period of three weeks failing which the order of confiscation would become absolute. In the confiscation proceedings initiated by the Collector under Section 14 (4) of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act,1937 the Collector himself had levied the penalty of Rs. 2,40,000/- in lieu of confiscation.
2. The High Court confirmed the order of confiscation but reduced the penalty to Rs. 1,00,000/-. The counsel for the appellant contends that the prosecution case itself being that the value of the contraband transported was only Rs.2,805/-, the penalty in lieu of confiscation to the tune of Rs. 1,00,000/- is grossly excessive and, therefore, the same should be reduced.
3.  Learned counsel appearing for the State is not in a position to refute the facts contained in the impugned order to the effect that the prosecution case itself is that the value of the contraband transported was Rs. 2,805/-.
4. In this view of the matter, we reduce the quantum of penalty to Rs. 25,000/- in place of Rs. 1,00,000/-, as directed by the High Court. The%said sum be deposited within three weeks failing which the order of confiscation would revive.The appeal is disposed of accordingly.

Appeal disposed of.
