The Order of the Court was as follows:
Application for impleadment stands rejected.
1.  This SLP is directed against the judgment of Delhi High Court. The petitioner assailed the initiation of a disciplinary proceedings by filing a Writ Petition in Delhi High Court. The Division Bench of the Delhi High Court did not interfere with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings, and in our view rightly.
2.  Mr. K.B. Rohtagi, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner further states that while the matter was pending before this Court, the enquiry proceedings (ex-parte) is already over, and therefore this petition assailing the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings has become infructuous. Without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the petitioner, the Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
