Preeti Sharma v Manjit Sharma
Supreme Court of India

29 April 2005
Transfer Petitions (C) Nos. 117-18 of 2004
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  This is a wife's petition for transfer of Suit No.553 of 2003 titled as Manjit Sharma v. Preeti Sharma pending before the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Muzaffar Nagar, U.P. and Suit No.163 of 2003 titled as Manjit Sharma v. Preeti Sharma pending before the Civil Judge (Senior Division), Muzaffar Nagar, U.P. to the Court of District Judge, Karkardooma, Shahdara, Delhi.
2.  The grounds made out are that the petitioner is an unemployed lady and totally dependent on her uncle and that she will be hard-pressed to defend the suit at Muzaffar Nagar. It is also claimed that there is a petition for restitution of conjugal rights and certain other proceedings pending in Delhi.
In our view, no substantial ground for transfer has been made out. If the petitioner wishes that all cases be tried at one place, she may apply for the same and we will transfer the cases pending in Delhi to Muzaffar Nagar. Merely because the petitioner is a lady does not mean she cannot travel to Muzaffar Nagar. At the highest she can be paid expenses for travel and stay. We, therefore, direct that the respondent shall pay to the petitioner and a companion travel and stay expenses on every occasion that the petitioner is required to go to Muzaffar Nagar. The Court at Muzaffar Nagar shall ensure that such payment is made to the petitioner on every occasion. With these directions, the transfer petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
