State of Haryana and Others v Gram Panchayat Vill. Majra
Supreme Court of India

2 February 2001
C.A..No.939/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the appellants on merits.
1.  We do not find any error in the findings of fact recorded by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court that the ownership of the land in question vests in Gram Panchayat, the plaintiff-respondent. The defendant-appellant claims to have planted certain trees on the land after declaring the land to be protected forest vide Notification dated 3.3.1972.
2.  The First Appellate Court has found that the Notification in question does not specify the land to which the Notification relates and therefore it cannot be positively held that the Notification relates to the suit land. Moreover, we are also not satisfied to hold that the State Government having planted trees on the land of Gram Panchayat has an unrestricted right to cut the trees and take-away the timber.
3.  For the aforegoing reasons, we do not find any fault with the High Court having refused to entertain the second appeal against the concurrent findings of facts recorded by the two courts below.
Accordingly, this appeal fails and is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
