Itc Bhadrachalam Paper Boards Limited v State of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

21 March 2001
C.A. Nos. 1404 to 1409 of 1999 with C.A. Nos. 1410 to 1413 of 1999 (Appeals by special leave from the judgments and orders Dt. 6 October 1998, and 14 October 1998, of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Revision Case Nos. 23 to 27 and 30 of 1994 and Nos. 19, 29, 31 and 32 of 1994 respectively).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned counsel and find no good reason to differ from the view of the High Court in regard to the first question which reads thus :
"(1) Whether coal and coal-ash (cinder) are to be treated as the same commodity or as different commodities for the purpose of taxation under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 ?"
2.  In so far as the second question is concerned, we take a different view. The second question reads thus :
"(2) Whether coal-ash is a product of the petitioner's industrial unit and whether the sale of 'coal-ash' by the petitioner is eligible for exemption under G.O.Ms. No. 606, dated April 9, 1981 ?"
3.  The High Court was of the view that the main production activity of the appellant was the manufacture of paper and paper boards, that coal-ash was only the left-over residue after burning coal as fuel in the manufacture of paper and paper boards, and that, therefore, the appellant was not entitled to the exemption on the sale of coal-ash under G.O.Ms. No. 606, dated April 9, 1981 as the coal-ash was not a product of the appellant.
4. The aforesaid order gives
"complete exemption to the products of the industry from sales tax for a limited period of five years"
5.  Given these two answers, the consideration of the third and fourth questions does not arise.
The civil appeals are allowed to the extent aforestated. No order as to costs.
Appeals partly allowed.
