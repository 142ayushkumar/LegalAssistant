K.T. Jayaprakash and Others v Director of Health Services and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 August 2001
C.A. No.888/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It appears that the appellants were served with the orders relieving them from services between January 15 and 16, 2001, and those orders are filed as annexures to the counter filed by the third respondent. It is specifically stated that much before the interim order was passed by this Court on January 25, 2001 the appellants were relieved from the service and that this fact was not brought to the notice of this Court.
2. In the reply filed to that counter what all is stated in para 5 is that they have been working after 25th January, 2001. In our view, it is not a reply which rebuts the contentions raised in the counter affidavit.
3.  What follows is that the appellants cease to function before the interim order was passed. We, therefore, vacate the interim order of this Court dated January 25, 2001.
Order accordingly.
