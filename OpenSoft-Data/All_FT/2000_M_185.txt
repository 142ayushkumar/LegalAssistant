Muslim Association v Masiullah Khan and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17355-17356/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  We do not find it a fit case to interfere in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. The special leave petitions are accordingly dismissed.
2. The Division Bench in its order dated 22nd August, 2000 has reserved the right with the petitioner.
However, those rights can be exercised by the petitioner and we request the learned Single Judge of the High Court that after the counter-affidavit as also an application for vacation of the interim order is filed in the High Court, on a mention being made by learned counsel for the petitioner, the matter may be fixed as expeditiously as possible and disposed of on the limited question of jurisdiction and vacation of interim stay.
Petitions dismissed.
