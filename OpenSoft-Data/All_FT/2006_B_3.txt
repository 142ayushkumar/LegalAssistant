B. C. Dalal v Custodian and others
Supreme Court of India

2 January 2006
C.A. No. 1516 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against the order of the Special Court (Trial of Offences Relating to Transactions in Securities), Bombay, directing the Custodian i.e. the first respondent herein, to take up sale of certain items of Respondents 3, 5 and 6 before that court. In this appeal the challenge to the impugned order is only by the appellant B.C. Dalai (Respondent 5 before the Special Court), the notified person. The learned Special Court has directed the sale of ornaments and jewellery seized from the residential flat of the notified person by the Income Tax Department and made over to the Custodian.
2. The learned Special Court has noted that the appellant has not filed any document which will indicate that these items are not owned by him but by his wife, daughters-in-law and sons and that they have also not cared to file any affidavit claiming ownership thereof.
3.  We have heard learned counsel and also perused the reply to the application that was filed by the appellant before the Special Court. Apart from what is noted in the impugned order, the reply of the appellant shows the vague pleas made by the appellant. It was stated therein that the jewellery seized by the Income Tax Department does not wholly belong to the appellant but it was not stated as to which part belonged to him and which part to anybody else. We find no infirmity in the impugned order.
In this view, the civil appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
