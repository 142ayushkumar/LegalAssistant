Sukhminder Singh Sukhi v State of Rajasthan
Supreme Court of India

5 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2978/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard Shri U.R. Lalit learned senior counsel for the petitioner and Shri Vijay Bahuguna learned senior counsel for the respondent.
2. On perusal of the relevant papers and on consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not feel that any interference with the order dated 5.7.2001 of the High court rejecting the Second Bail Application No.1295 of 2001 is called for.
3.  Then Shri U.R. Lalit submitted that a time frame for conclusion of the trial may be fixed by this Court. We are not inclined to accept the prayer as we find that the High Court has already issued directions for expeditious trial of the case and the Trial Court is aware of the direction.
4.  However, if there is undue delay in disposal of the case by the trial court it will be open to the petitioner to move the High Court for appropriate order in the matter. The SLP is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
