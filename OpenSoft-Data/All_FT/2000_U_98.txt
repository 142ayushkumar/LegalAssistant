Union of India and Others v Sharwan K. Rajgarhia and Another
Supreme Court of India

5  May  2000
C.A. No. ... of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Deemed service has been effected without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case. We are of the opinion that the High Court ought not to have stayed the operation of the Finance Act more so, when the order in question does not contain any reason as to why stay was being granted.
2. Normally operation of the Finance Act is not stayed pending the hearing of a writ petition unless there are some compelling circumstances which have not been shown in the present case.
3.  We therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the order dated 7-4-1999 of the High Court which had stayed to the extent the same had stayed the operation of the provision of Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 as amended by the Finance Act 2 of 1998 insofar as it related to Chartered Accountants.
Appeal allowed.
