Fermentapharma Biotech v Commissioner Of Central Excise & Customs
Supreme Court of India

27 September 2000
C.A. No. D.12171 of 2000, Dt. 27 September 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  According to us, the only question involved relates to appreciation of evidence. This Court will go into appreciation of evidence only after it is shown that one of the Grounds of Appeal states that the conclusion under challenge was such as could not possibly have been arrived at by persons duly instructed upon the material before them; in other words, that the conclusion is perverse.
2. Although it was shown that there was no such ground, we have heard learned Counsel to the extent we considered necessary.
The civil appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
