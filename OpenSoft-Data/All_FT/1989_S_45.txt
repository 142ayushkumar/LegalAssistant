Abdul Shakoor and Another v Shakura Begum (Now Dead) Through Lrs
Supreme Court of India

9 February 1989
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 5519 of 1986 with Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 12599 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are surprised to find that a number of special leave petitions which are barred by time, according to the limitation report put up by the Registry, are being assigned a number by the Registry and are being posted before the court for hearing even though there is no application for condonation of delay. This is one such case.
2.  Whenever the officer comes across such a petition which is barred by time, the Registry should ask the advocate-on-record or the person filing such petition to file an application for condonation of delay and until such application for condonation of delay is made, such petition shall not be posted before the bench for hearing on merits.
Until such application for condonation of delay is made and the delay is condoned either absolutely or conditionally, that is, subject to objection by respondent the petition shall not be assigned any number by the Registry. It is hoped that this procedure will set right the laxity which has now crept into the working of the Registry.
3.  The above direction is of course subject to any direction that may be issued by the court in a given case.
Order accordingly.
