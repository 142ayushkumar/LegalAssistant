The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Appellant stands convicted under Section 452 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Earlier he and some others were convicted under Section 452 and Section 323 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. When the matter was taken up in revision the High Court while affirming the sentence of imprisonment, enhanced the fine amount to Rs.2000/- Learned counsel for the appellant made a plea that the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act may be applied to this appellant or else he will lose his job as government servant.
2. For considering the said plea we called for a report from the probationary officer and the report of the probationary officer shows that there is no impediment in dealing with the appellant under the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act. We are disposed to save the appellant from the consequence befalling him in his service career on account of the conviction and sentence imposed.
3.  We, therefore, alter the sentence passed on him instead of sentencing him we release him under Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act He is directed to execute a bond in the trial court within two months from today in a sum of Rs.2000/- with two solvent sureties to keep peace and be of good behaviour. He will be subjected to the supervision by the Probation Officer during the said period.
