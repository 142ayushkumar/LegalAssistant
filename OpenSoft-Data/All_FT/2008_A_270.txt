Union of India v Atma Fibres Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

18 August 2008
C.A. No. 5058 of 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This Civil Appeal is filed by Union of India. It is directed solely against an interim order. Without going into the merits of the case and without going into the allegations and counter allegations, the only ground on which we are inclined to set aside the impugned order is that the High Court ought not to have released the goods in question vide interim orders without filing of the Bills of Entries.
2.   In several instances such situation has been arising. It is well settled that filing of the Bill of Entry is required for custom appraisal. Whatever be the reasons and whatever be the difficulties faced by the assessee(s), the High Court ought not to have released the goods without the assessee filing the Bills of Entries. With these observations, we set aside the impugned order. We also permit the Department to encash the Bank Guarantee, particularly, because the goods have been released.
3.  For above reasons, we also set aside the Order passed by the High Court in Contempt Jurisdiction.
4.  In the facts and circumstances, we further request the High Court to hear and dispose of the pending Writ Petition CWP No. 18601 of 2007, as expeditiously as possible and preferably within three months.
The appeal is accordingly allowed with no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
