Banhisikha Roy (Now Sengupta) v Somnath Roy and others
Supreme Court of India

25 July 2005
Cr.A. No. 920 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 2876 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave is granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  By the impugned order the High Court has quashed the criminal proceedings initiated against the respondent under Sections 498-A, 406 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code.
2. We have perused the contents of the complaint filed before the Magistrate. Para 14 of the said complaint reads thus:
"That on several occasions both the accused persons assaulted the complainant mercilessly as she did not ask her father for making payments of Rs. 50,000 as demanded by Accused 1 and all the accused persons after assaulting her forcefully took her to uncle's house on 4-6-1995 saying that if she did not bring the money she would have no place in their house. On the said date Accused 1 also stated that he would not accept the complainant as his wife anymore. That on 4-6-1995 the complainant was forced to come back in her uncle's house with Accused 1 and 2 and since then in spite of several requests Accused 1 has never come to take the complainant in their house."
3.  In our considered opinion, these are clear allegations of cruelty meted out to the appellant wife on demand of dowry. The High Court is, therefore, clearly in error in coming to the conclusion that prima facie no case for offence under Section 498-A is made out against the respondent.
4.  We allow this appeal and quash the impugned order of the High Court. All defences available to the respondent-accused will be open to him to be urged before the Magistrate.
Appeal allowed.
