Union of India and Others v Triveni Engineering Works Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 February 1999
C.A. No. 492 of 1999 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 19320 of 1998), Dt. 2 February 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.   The fixation of minimum price of levy sugar for the year 1982-83 has already been upheld by this Court in Modi industries Ltd. v. Union of India (Transferred Case No. (C) No. 9 of 1990 decided on 20-2-1996 decided on 20-2-1996. The correctness of this decision came to be questioned before a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Shri Malaprabha Coop. Sugar Factory Ltd. v. Union of India 1997 Indlaw SC 3328 but it was not accepted and the Court made the following observations :
" The order that was passed by this Court on 20-2-1996 in Transferred Case (Civil) No. 9 of 1990 (Transferred Case No. (C) No. 9 of 1990 decided on 20-2-1996 was in respect of levy sugar price for the year 1982-83 and, therefore, it cannot have any bearing on the fixation of price of levy sugar for the years 1975-76 to 1979-80. Moreover, this Court, while passing the said order, has clearly stated that"
4. A two-Judge Bench of this Court in Bharat Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (Transferred Cases (C) Nos.15-17 of 1993) decided on 19-8-1998, followed the decision of this Court in Transferred Case (Civil) No. 9 of 1990 (Transferred Case No. (C) No. 9 of 1990 decided on 20-2-1996). The contention of the learned counsel for the respondents is that since it was admitted by the Union of India in the affidavit filed before the Allahabad High Court that the factors set out in clause 5-A of the Sugar (Control) Order, 1966 were not taken into consideration, the fixation of price was bad.
5. It may be pointed out that in Bharat Sugar Mills case (Transferred Cases (C) Nos. 15-17 of 1993) the Court had taken into consideration the additional affidavit dated 11-6-1998 filed by Mr. Surendra Kumar, Joint Secretary, Government of India, setting out the manner in which minimum price for levy sugar for the year 1982-83 had been determined and after taking into consideration that affidavit, the Court upheld the fixation of price.
6. In view of the above, since in this case also it is the price for the year 1982-83 which is involved, as also in view of the further that the price fixation has already been upheld in the three decisions of this Court, we are not prepared to accept the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that the fixation of minimum price for levy sugar for the year 1982-83 was not correctly fixed.
7. For the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order passed by the Allahabad High Court dated 17-3-1998 is set aside. The writ petition filed by the respondent is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.

2. Transferred Case (Civil) No. 9 of 1990, decided on February 20, 1996.
ORDER
1. In compliance with our order dated 30-1-1996, an additional affidavit on behalf of the Union of India has been filed by Shri Deepak Khandekar, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India. In the additional affidavit, it has been expressly stated that while determining the minimum cane price of levy sugar regard has been had only to the minimum cane price as spoken to in S. 3(3-C)(a) of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and the additional cane price payable under clause 5-A of the Sugar (Control) Order, 1966, has not been taken into account, and that also there has been no mopping up of excess realisation on levy-free sale sugar while fixing the price of levy sugar for the season 1982-83.
2. In view of the above further statement made in the additional affidavit filed on behalf of the Union of India, we are satisfied that this matter is not covered by the decision of this Court in Shri Malaprabha Coop. Sugar Factory Ltd. v. Union of India 1993 indlaw sc 651. Accordingly, the transferred case is dismissed. 
No costs.

BHARAT SUGAR MILLS LTD. AND ANOTHER .... PETITIONERS
3. T.Cs. (Civil) Nos. 15-17 of 1993 with T.Cs. (C) Nos. 21-22, 29, 31, 37 and 40 of 1993, decided on August 19, 1998.
1. All these cases deal with determining the minimum price of levy sugar for the year 1982-83 in the zones of Central U.P. and North Bihar. We have seen the additional affidavit dated 11-6-1998 filed by Shri Surendra Kumar, Joint Secretary, Government of India setting out the manner in which minimum price for levy sugar for 1982-83 had been determined. The very same determination of minimum price of levy sugar for the year 1982-83 was under challenge in Modi Industries Ltd. v. Union of India (Transferred Case No. (C) No. 9 of 1990 decided on 20-2-1996). A Bench of three Judges of this Court by their order dated 20-2-1996 after noting that the minimum cane price had been fixed for the year 1982-83 under S. 3(3-C)(a) of the Essential Commodities Act has also noticed that the additional cane price payable under clause 5-A of the Sugar (Control) Order, 1996 had not been taken into account nor was there any mopping up of excess realisation on free sale sugar while fixing the price of levy sugar for the year 1982-83. This Court has held that the matter was not covered by the decision of this Court in Shri Malaprabha Coop. Sugar Factory Ltd. v. Union of India 1993 indlaw sc 651 and had dismissed the transferred case. Our attention has been drawn to Shri Malaprabha Coop. Sugar Factory Ltd. v. Union of India 1997 Indlaw SC 3328. In  that decision this Court has expressly noted the decision in Transferred Case No. 9 of 1990 (supra) and has held that the first Shri Malaprabha case did not affect the Transferred Case (Civil) No. 9 of 1990. The decision in Transferred Case (Civil) No. 9 of 1990 is directly applicable to the present set of transferred cases which also deal with the same price fixed for the season 1982-83. In view thereof, these transferred cases are also dismissed.
2. The respondents apply for extension of time for fixing the price of sugar under our order of 21-4-1998 pertaining to T.Cs. (Civil) Nos. 18-20, 23-28, 30, 32-36 and 38-39 of 1993. The time is extended by six weeks from today.
Appeal dismissed.
