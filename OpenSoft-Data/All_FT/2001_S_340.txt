Singheshwari Devi v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18396/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is submitted that apart from the notification relied upon by the petitioner before the High Court, there are subsequent notifications which give benefit to the petitioner. If such subsequent notifications are there, it is open to the petitioner to make representation on that basis claiming benefit of the same so far as the notification.
2. As far the Government instructions of 1976 are concerned the High Court was correct in coming to the conclusion that the same is not applicable to the petitioner since her husband died prior to 31.3.1976.
With the said observation the SLP stands disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
