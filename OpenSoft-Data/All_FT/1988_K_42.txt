Lal Chand (Dead) By Lrs v Kasturilal and Others
Supreme Court of India

16 February 1988
C.A. No. 2994 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Special leave was granted confined to the question as to whether Ex. P 1 was compulsorily registrable. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The document which is on record has also been seen by us. It is a receipt evidencing payment of money and we are of the view that the provisions of Section 17(1)(b) and (c) of the Registration Act would not apply to the document so as to require it to be compulsorily registered.
2.   The High Court was, therefore, right in relying upon the document though it was not registered
3.  The appeal has no merit and is dismissed. Parties are directed to bear their own costs in this Court.
Appeal dismissed.
