Rup Singh v Bakhtawar Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 November 1986
C.A. No. 473 of 1973.
The Judgment was delivered by: Ranganath Misra, J.
1.  We heard learned counsel for the parties and read the papers with care and anxiety to find out whether there is any point in support of the appeal. We have come to the conclusion that the appeal has absolutely no merit and has to be dismissed. One fact is, however, certain on the findings. The appellant was uprooted from the natural family and was brought up by Arjun Singh, father of the plaintiffs as a son. Claim of adoption has not been accepted. Yet equity warrants that the appellant should be given some residential accommodation and a part of the land for cultivation. Looking into the facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to think that the ends of justice will be met if residential accommodation of at least one room and give bighas of land be carved out and given to the appellant.
2.   The trial Judge is directed to give effect to this order namely, ensure allotment of an one-roomed house and five bighas of land out of the disputed properties either amicably or failing that through a Commissioner to be appointed by the trial Judge, at the cost of the appellant. It will also be open to the respondents to raise a room for accommodation of the appellant in the event of none of the existing residential accommodation being convenient. This arrangement should be completed within one year from today and until then, the appellant would be entitled to reside where he is living.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly, No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
