Raveendran v State of Tamil Nadu
Supreme Court of India

23 October 2008
Criminal Appeal No. 385 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The sole appellant was convicted by the Trial Court under Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, [hereinafter referred to as "I.P.C."] and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years. He was further convicted under Section 498-A I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay fine of Rupees one thousand; in default, to undergo further imprisonment for a period of six months. The appellant was also convicted under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three months and to pay fine of Rupees one thousand; in default, to undergo further imprisonment for a period of fifteen days. All the sentences, however, were ordered to run concurrently. On appeal being preferred, Sessions Court confirmed the convictions. Thereafter, when the matter was taken to the High Court in revision, the convictions of the appellant have been confirmed. Hence, this appeal by special leave.
2.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records, we are of the view that the Trial Court, Appellate Court as well as the High Court have recorded convictions of the appellant upon detailed discussion of evidence and no interference by this Court is called for.
The appeal, accordingly, fails and the same is dismissed.
3.  The bail bonds of the appellant, who is on bail, are cancelled and he is directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence for which the matter shall be reported to this Court by the Trial Court within two months from the date of receipt of copy of this order.
Appeal dismissed
