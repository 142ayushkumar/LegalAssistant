"(1) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal is legally correct in holding that a reference, made to the Valuation Officer in compliance with the directions of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner cannot be a reference under section 16A of the Wealth-tax Act, 1957?
(2) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal is legally correct in holding that the report from the Valuation Officer, although obtained on the basis of a reference made as a result of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner's directions, is not binding on the Wealth-tax Officer under section 16A(6) of the Wealth-tax Act ?
(3) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal is correct in holding that the Commissioner was not correct in concluding that the Wealth-tax Officer was duty bound to accept the Valuation Officer's report so far as the valuation of assets was concerned and by not doing so, the assessments made by the Wealth-tax Officer, be treated as erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue ?"
Appeal allowed.
