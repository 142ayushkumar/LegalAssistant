Smt. Sattamma v K. Rajaiah and Others
Supreme Court of India

29 June 1987
Cr.As. Nos. 272-73 of 1987 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) Nos. 2219-20 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  In these appeals by special leave the appellant is aggrieved by the detention of her husband, Kotha Das, under the National Security Act, 1980, and prays for his release.
2.  Kotha Das was arrested on February 16, 1986. On February 17, 1986 an order of detention in respect of him was made under sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the National Security Act, 1980 by the Commissioner of Police, Hyderabad City directing that Kotha Das be detained under Sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Act. It appears that after the case was referred by the State Government to the Advisory Board the Advisory Board reported that there was sufficient cause for the detention, and the State Government thereafter made an order on 11 April, 1986 directing the detention of the detenue for one year from the date of the detention order.
3.   Two successive writ petitions were filed by the appellant in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh challenging the detention of the detenue. A number of contentions have been raised before us in the attempt to show that the High Court his committed an error in rejecting the writ petitions. At the out-set we may note that according to Section 13 of the National Security Act 1980 the maximum period for which any person may be detained in pursuance of the detention order which has been confirmed under Section 12 of the Act is twelve months from the date of detention. The period of twelve months has expired. In the circumstances these appeals have become infructuous and are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
