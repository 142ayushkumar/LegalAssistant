Ashgbarati and Another v Saifuddin and Another
Supreme Court of India

4 March 1994
C.A. No. 783 of 1980
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The short question that arises for our consideration is whether there was a sub-letting prior to 1949, i.e., prior to the coming into force of the Central Provinces and Berar Letting of Houses and Rent Control Order, 1949 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Order') and whether the tenant was liable to be evicted u/cl. 13(3)(iii) of the said Order.
2.  Our answer should be in the affirmative. This question directly came up for consideration in Goppulal v. Thakurji Shriji Dwarakadheeshji 1969 Indlaw SC 1951969 Indlaw SC 195. Though that case related to the Rajasthan Premises (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1950, the language employed is identical.
3.   However, what is argued before us is that the decision in Goppulal v. Dwarakadheeshji  1969 Indlaw SC 1951969 Indlaw SC 195 is distinguishable. In fact, such a distinction was made in Gurcharan Singh v. V.K. Kaushal 1980 Indlaw SC 176. We may add here that this ruling of Gurcharan Singh v. V.K. Kaushal 1980 Indlaw SC 176 dealt with a situation where the language was
"after the commencement of this Act, without the written consent of the landlord - (a) transferred his right under the lease or sublet the entire building or rented land or any portion thereof"
4.  The courts below are right in their decision. The civil appeal carries no merit, and is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal Dismissed.
