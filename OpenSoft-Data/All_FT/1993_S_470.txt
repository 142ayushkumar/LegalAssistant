State of Orissa and another v Shankarasan Mohanty and others
Supreme Court of India

3 August 1993
S.L.P. (C) No. 4727 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We see no reason to interfere. The High Court has merely stated that the respondents should be given the same salary as is being given to a regular employee at that level from 1-1-1992. Counsel for the petitioner states that it is not clear whether the High Court takes the minimum basic salary with or without increment because that would differ from employee to employee. It is obvious that the High Court says that the daily wagers should not be given less than what the regulars get. That is to be calculated at the basic minimum.
2.  The High Court has further stated that they may be regularised in accordance with the resolution issued by the Government. We do not see any reason why they should not be regularised as per the resolution if they are entitled to regularisation. We, therefore, dispose of the petition accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
