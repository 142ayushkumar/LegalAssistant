Belpahar Refractories Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

19 July 1994
C.As. Nos. 1086 to 1089-A of 1977
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals were stated to be concluded by a decision of this court in Travancore Sugars and Chemicals Ltd. v. CIT 1966 Indlaw SC 199. We have gone through the judgment and on first impression it may appear to be so. But the problem in the case is that the first question framed by the learned Income-tax Appellate Tribunal is as follows {1976 Indlaw ORI 63)
"(1) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in deleting -
Rs. 3, 08, 012 (in assessment year 1962-63)
Rs. 5, 57, 658 (in assessment year 1963-64)
Rs. 5, 79, 336 (in assessment year 1964-65)
Rs.3,57,681 (in assessment year 1965-66) and
Rs.5,87,729 (in assessment year 1966-67)
on the ground that the said capital expenditures were converted into revenue expenditures and if the said deletions were legal ?"
2.  The question as framed proceeds on the basis that the expenditure in dispute is a capital expenditure for acquiring a capital asset. The question as framed was never the question before this court in Travancore Sugars and Chemicals Ltd.'s case 1966 Indlaw SC 199. There, this court  pointed out that
"On the contrary, the very nature of the payments excludes the idea that any connection with the capital sum was intended by the parties."
3.  Therefore, the case of Travancore Sugars and Chemicals Ltd. 1966 Indlaw SC 199 (SC) cannot assist us in arriving at a decision. Once the finding is given by the Tribunal as finding of fact, namely, that the amount in dispute was really relatable to acquisition of a capital asset, the question of conversion to revenue expenditure does not arise.
4. In fact, one cannot follow such a decision. Unfortunately, the assessee never asked for such a question on the finding whether the amount in dispute was spent for acquisition of a capital asset. In fact, the plea before us is that the payments which are made have no connection with the acquisition of a capital asset as no price was fixed. No such question arises in the present case.
5.  For the aforesaid reasons, the appeals fail and are dismissed. The parties are directed to bear their own costs of these appeals.
Appeals disposed of.
