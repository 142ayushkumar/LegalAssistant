State of Madhya Pradesh and Another v Babulal
Supreme Court of India

21 January 1999
Review Petition (C) No. 2379 of 1998 (in S.L.P. (C) No. 6498 of 1998), Dt. 21 January 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Forty one days delay in filing the review petition is condoned.
1.  We have considered the review petition and the accompanying papers. In our view, this review petition is totally misconceived. The order passed by this Court on 13-7-1998 in the special leave petition was by agreement between the parties. In fact at the stage of issuance of notice in the special leave petition on 30-3-1998 it was noted that learned Senior for the petitioners had sought a limited clarification from the other side as to whether the decree passed against the petitioner-State should be confined to the area of 195' x 95' out of Survey No. 373 only.
2.  It was this limited grievance for redressal of which notice was issued and that grievance was satisfied by agreement between the parties, as noted in the impugned order of 13-7-1998. We fail to appreciate how a fresh attempt can be made in these review proceedings to get the entire matter reargued. Such an attempt, to say the least, is totally misconceived and uncalled for. We say nothing more.
The review petition is, therefore, dismissed on merits.
Review dismissed.
