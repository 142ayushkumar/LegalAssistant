Ravindranath Harishchandra Angre v State Of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

1  May  2009
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.886 OF 2009
(Arising out of SLP (Criminal) No.905 of 2009
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2.  This appeal is directed against the order dated 11th July, 2008 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Criminal Application No.1535 of 2008. By the impugned order the High Court has rejected the application filed by the appellant for grant of bail in the case arising out of F.I.R. No.I-445/2007 dated 19th October, 2007, registered under Sections 323, 392, 384, 504 and 506 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and Sections 3 and 25 of the Arms Act.
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and bearing in mind the fact that the charge sheet has already been filed on 9th April, 2008 and the appellant has been in custody since 22nd February, 2008, in our opinion, it is a fit case where the benefit of regular bail should be granted to the appellant.
3.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed; the impugned order is set aside and it is directed that the appellant shall be admitted to bail on his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees twenty five thousand only) with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The appellant shall not, directly or indirectly influence the witnesses and shall not leave India without the previous approval of the trial court.
The appeal stands disposed of in the above terms.
