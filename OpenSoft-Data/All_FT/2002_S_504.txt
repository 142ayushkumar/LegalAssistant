State of Maharashtra v Bhavesh Visharia
Supreme Court of India

8 January 2002
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 7110/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra contended that Section 120B IPC is also one of the offences pitted against the respondent and hence the confession made by a co-accused will have utility under Section 10 of the Evidence Act. In support of the said contention learned counsel invited our attention to the decision of this court in State of Maharashtra Vs. Damu S/o Gopinath Shinde and others 2000 Indlaw SC 570.
2.  As the proceedings were taken under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOC Act) wherein the bail provisions have been made very stringent we prima facie feel that the impugned order cannot be sustained. Accordingly, we suspend the impugned order. We direct the respondent to surrender to the bail.Issue notice.
Order accordingly.
