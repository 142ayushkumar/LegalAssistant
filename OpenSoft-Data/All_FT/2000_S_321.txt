Sri Prasada Rao Mikkilineni and Others v State of Andhra Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

16 March 2000
C.A. No. 2150 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties finally in this appeal.
2.  A limited notice was issued at the SLP stage on 10-11-1997 to the following effect:
"Delay condoned.
Issue notice for final disposal requiring the respondents to show cause why reference as asked for, should not be made."
3.  We find that there is a dispute about the title as also regarding computation of appropriate compensation for acquiring the land in question. Hence, this is a fit case where the High Court should have allowed the writ petition and should have directed the Land Acquisition Officer to make reference under Section 18 read with Section 30 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Only on this short ground, therefore, this appeal is allowed.
4. The impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside and the Land Acquisition Officer is directed to make a reference, under Section 18 read with Section 30 of the Land Acquisition Act, to the appropriate court within eight weeks from the receipt of a copy of this order at his end.
5.  Office to send a copy of this order to the Special Deputy Collector, Land Acquisition Officer (Central), Hyderabad (A.P.) for necessary action.
No costs.
Appeal allowed.
