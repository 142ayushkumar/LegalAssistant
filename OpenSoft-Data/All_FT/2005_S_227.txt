Chairman, Tele., Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and others v Sinclair Infra Tech Limited
Supreme Court of India

25 February 2005
S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 3430-31 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  As the respondents are present on caveat formal issuance of service of notice is dispensed with. Having considered the facts of the case, we are of the view that there was an arguable question of law which appears to have been overlooked by the High Court, namely, whether reciprocal obligations under an award can be enforced unilaterally.
2. We accordingly stay the execution of the award. The High Court is requested to dispose of both the main appeal from the order rejecting application for setting aside an award as well as the civil revision petition pertaining to the execution proceedings as expeditiously as is conveniently possible, preferably within three months. The interim order granted by us will continue until the disposal of the revisional application. This order, however, will not prevent the respondent from seeking execution of the decree in terms of the award.
The SLPs are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
