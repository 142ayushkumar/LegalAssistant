Aslam v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

4 December 2003
Cr.A. No. 115 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Heard the learned counsel for the parties. The appellant was convicted by the trial court u/s. 394 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 [for short, "I.P.C."] and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of four years. He was further convicted u/s. 411 I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years. The sentences were, however, ordered to run concurrently. On appeal being preferred, the conviction and sentence of the appellant u/s. 411 I.P.C. were set aside and the conviction u/s. 394 I.P.C. was upheld. On the matter being taken to the High Court in revision, the conviction of the appellant u/s. 394 I.P.C. was upheld. Hence, this appeal by special leave.
2. We have been taken through the judgements of the three courts below wherefrom it appears that all the courts have concurrently found the appellant guilty u/s. 394 I.P.C. We do not find any ground to interfere with the concurrent findings recorded by the courts below.
3. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the appellant has remained in jail for a period of about one year and prays that the sentence may be reduced to the period already undergone by him.
4. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that ends of justice would be met if the sentence awarded against the appellant is reduced to the period already undergone. Accordingly, the criminal appeal is allowed in part and the sentence awarded against the appellant is reduced to the period already undergone by him.
5. Bail bonds shall stand discharged.
Appeal partly allowed
