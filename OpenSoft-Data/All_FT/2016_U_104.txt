1. Leave granted.
2. The issue pertains to the dispute on termination of the respondent. Having regard to the prolonged litigation between the parties and having regard to the fact that the appellant-Company has been closed down in the year 2014, we made a fair suggestion to purchase peace between the parties by way of making one time payment of Rs.7 Lakhs to the respondent.
3. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant submits that in the case of all other workers, dues have been settled for an amount of around Rs.4 Lakhs. In the instant case, the respondent-workman has succeeded before the Labour Court and the High Court and having regard to the prolonged litigation, we are of view that the interest of justice would be met if an amount of Rs. 7 Lakhs is paid. The appellant is directed to pay an amount of Rs. 7 Lakhs to the respondent within two months from today in full and final settlement of all his claims.
4. However, we make it clear that this order is passed in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and this will not be taken as a precedent.
5. With the above observations and direction, the appeal is disposed of. No costs.
Appeal disposed of
