Birendra Kumar Ghosh v Shiv Nandan Prasad Gupta
Supreme Court of India

17 February 1994
C.A. No. 1827 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In spite of strenuous arguments of Mr Ranjit Kumar that there is no necessity on the part of the tenant to re-tender the amount, on the refusal of the landlord we find that this is a clear case of default because the tenant had deducted the money-order commission. In such a case, the amount sent by money-order would not represent the true rent. Accordingly, the appeal stands dismissed. No costs.
As regards time to vacate the premises, both the learned counsel are agreed to the following:
(i) The landlord will not levy execution for recovery of possession until 30-6-1994;
(ii) This shall be subject to the condition that the tenant files usual undertaking within four weeks to deliver vacant possession on or before 30-6-1994.
Appeal dismissed.
