Society for Human Rights and Civil Liberties v Union of India and another
Supreme Court of India

22 March 2004
W.P. (Cr.) No. 31/2004
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. The writ petition purports to have been filed in public interest. The averments made in the petition and the affidavit filed in support thereof do not satisfy the requirements laid down time and again in several judgments of this Court.
2. We are not inclined to entertain the petition as framed.
3. At this stage, the learned counsel for the petitioner seeks to withdraw the petition. The writ petition is, therefore, dismissed as withdrawn as prayed.
