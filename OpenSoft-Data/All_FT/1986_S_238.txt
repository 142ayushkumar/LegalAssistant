Guljit Singh v State of Punjab and Another
Supreme Court of India

24 November 1986
C.A. No. 4337 of 1986 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 12359 of 1985).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted. The appeal is heard.
1.  Ms. Mridula Roy, learned counsel for the appellant states that she would not claim back wages for the period during which the appellant was kept out of service by virtue of the impugned order of termination of his service provided the appellant is directed to be reinstated. Shri N. S. Dass Bahl, learned counsel for the respondents has not given any reason why the appellant should not be reinstated. We do not also find any justification for the termination of the service of the appellant. The reason given by the High Court to distinguish Belliappa case is not acceptable.
2.   In the circumstances, we set aside the orders of the Letters Patent Bench and of the Single Judge of the High Court and also the award passed by the Labour Court and direct that the appellant be reinstated in the post which he held before termination subject to the condition that the appellant will not be entitled to any back wages till today. If the appellant reports for duty within one week, the Punjab Roadways shall allow the appellant to join his duty in the post in which he was working before termination. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
