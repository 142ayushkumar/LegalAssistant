Badri Lal Jat v Aashish Bahuguna and Anr
Supreme Court of India

24 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.2315/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner is guilty of deliberate suppression of facts as pointed out in the counter affidavit. He did not have any order exclusively in his favour from the High Court but still made wrong statement that there was an order in his favour.
2.  After the counter affidavit was filed pointing out the above suppressive facts, the petitioner filed a rejoinder contending that even if there was no exclusive order in his favour in the writ petition specifically, the judgment rendered in certain other matters must be treated as judgment "in rem". The classes of judgments in rem are exclusively indicated in the Indian Evidence Act and the judgment relating to the service matters as the one in the present case is not covered by any of the Sections of the Evidence Act relating to judgment in rem.
Hence, the special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
