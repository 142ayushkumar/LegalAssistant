Commissioner of Income Tax v E. Merck Service and Agencies
Supreme Court of India

17 March 1999
C.A. No. 6169 of 1995.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court at Bombay rejected the Revenue's application under s. 256(2) of the IT Act. The questions to which the application pertained read thus:
"1. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the ass essee had claimed extra shift allowance on computer only and not on data processing machines and computer is eligible for extra shift allowance despite the fact that Appendix-I, III(C)(3) of the IT Rules clearly prohibit granting extra shift allowance on both the above items ?
2. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the assessee is entitled to investment allowance on data processing machine/computer even though the assessee is not engaged in any of t he activities mentioned in s. 32A(2) but only acts as intending agent for foreign companies ?"
2.  The High Court ref erred to it s decision in CIT vs. I. B. M. World Trade Corporation 1977 Indlaw MUM 3460  observed that the answers to the questions were self-evident.
3.  We have heard learned counsel and seen the judgment afore-mentioned. It seems to us that questions of law certainly arise and they ought to be referred to the High Court for a decision thereon. In rendering it, the High Court may take into consideration the judgment afore-mentioned but we do not think that it is correct to say that it furnish es a self-evident answer to the questions.
4. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The application of the Revenue under s. 256(2) is allowed. The Tribunal shall refer the questions quoted above to the High Court, having drawn up the requisite statement of case.No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
