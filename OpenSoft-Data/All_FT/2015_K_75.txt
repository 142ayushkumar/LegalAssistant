Krishan Chand Gupta v Yogesh Kumar and another
Supreme Court of India

25 August 2015
Civil Appeal No. 2091 of 2015 (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 28209 of 2009)
(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Dipak Misra, J.
1. In this appeal, by special leave, the appellant calls in question the legal propriety of the order dated 3.11.2006 passed in C.R. No. 2530 of 2006 by the learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh whereby he has declined to interfere with the order dated 20.01.2006 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Kurukshetra in Appeal No. 54 of 2005 whereby the learned Appellate Judge has affirmed the order dated 7.12.2005 passed by the learned Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division), Kurukshetra, whereby he has declined to entertain the petition preferred under Order IX Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the judgment in civil suit no. 806/93.
2. On a perusal of the order passed by the High Court, we find that the trial court as well as the appellate court have analysed the facts in detail and declined to exercise the civil revisional jurisdiction. In our considered opinion, there is no merit in the appeal and accordingly the same stands dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed
