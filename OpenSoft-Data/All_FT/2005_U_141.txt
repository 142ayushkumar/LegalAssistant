Hari Ram Maurya v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

5 September 2005
C.A. No. 5523 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 16372 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard counsel for the parties.
1.  From the order of termination Annexure P-7, it appears that the same refers to the show-cause notice dated 20-8-2002 which is to be found at Annexure P-5. It is stated therein that the appellant demanded kickback with a view to help the complainant to get a favourable order in the pension matter. That being so, there was a clear charge of bribery levelled against the appellant. No doubt, the appellant was a temporary employee, but if he is sought to be removed on the ground that he was guilty of the charge of bribery, it becomes necessary for the respondent Union of India to hold an inquiry and thereafter to act in accordance with law.
2. In this case, admittedly, no inquiry was conducted, and that is obvious even from Annexure P-7, the letter described as disengagement of casual labour.
3.  We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the order of the High Court as also the order of termination Annexure P-7 dated 30-9-2002. This, however, will not prevent the respondents from taking action in accordance with law.
Appeal allowed.
