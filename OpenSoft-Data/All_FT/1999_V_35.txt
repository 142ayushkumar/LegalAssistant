Parameswari and another v Vennila
Supreme Court of India

2 August 1999
Cr.As. No. 741 of 1999 (Arising, out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 600 of 1999) with No. 742 of 1999 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 602 of 1999)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellants have been convicted for the offence punishable under Section 494 read with Section 109 IPC. They have now arrived at a settlement with complainant Vennila, wife of the appellant Sivaprakasam. Compromise was made in the presence of panchayatdars of their village Mannachanallur. The compromise agreement duly signed by the parties and panchayatdars is placed on record of this Court. The appellants and complainant Vennila have now filed a joint application for permission to compound the offence proved against the appellants. The wife has also filed her consent independently and is also represented by an advocate. The compromise on the face of it appears to be reasonable and in the interest of the wife. The consent given by the wife also appears to be free and genuine. She is an educated woman. The offence in this case is compoundable with the consent of the wife and permission of the Court.
2. In our opinion, this is a fit case in which permission deserves to be granted. Accordingly, we grant the application for permission to compound the offence with the result that the appellants stand acquitted of the offence for which they have been held guilty.
3.  The appeals are disposed of accordingly. The bail bonds executed by the appellants shall stand cancelled.
Appeals disposed of.
