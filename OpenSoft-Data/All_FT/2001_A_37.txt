A.P. State Road Transport Corporation and Others v Sophaia Bee
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3478/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  When the Government banned the new appointments the High Court noticed that there was a ban on the appointment to the post of Attendant/Sweeper also. But the High Court has not examined the question whether the order banning such appointments would be applicable to cases of compassionate appointments or not.
2. Even so, it proceeded to order that the respondent should be employed on compassionate ground which it ought not to have done.
3.  Therefore, we cannot agree with the view taken by the High Court. However, in the special features of this case, we are not inclined to interfere with the ultimate order made by the High Court directing the appointment of the respondent. The Special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
4.  As this order has been made in view of the special features of this case, we make it clear that it will not be treated as a precedent.
Petition disposed of.
