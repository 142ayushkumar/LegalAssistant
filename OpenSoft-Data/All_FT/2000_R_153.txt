Rajesh and Others v Ramdeo and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 September 2000
Criminal Appeal No. 795 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal is directed against the impugned order of the High Court of Bombay at Nagpur Bench in criminal writ petition, directing a fresh and further investigation by an agency other than the local police, though on the basis of the F.I.R., the local police did investigate into the matter, and in the meantime, has filed charge-sheet against the accused persons. While the investigation was on, the complainant approached the High Court by filing a writ petition.
The High Court has taken an unusual step of forming a panel and directing them to examine the matter, and on the basis of the said panel report, the High Court has directed a further investigation by an agency other than the local police to be headed by the Superintendent of Police. Since the investigating agency has already filed the charge-sheet on the basis of which the accused persons are being proceeded with, if any further materials are available, the Court may alter the charge framed.
In the circumstances we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that the High Court has overstepped its jurisdiction in issuing the impugned direction calling upon further investigation into the matter, which in our considered opinion, would be an abuse of the process of Court. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order of the High Court dated 9.3.2000. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Needless to mention, power of the investigation agency to have any further investigation exercised under Section 173 (8), Cr. P.C. is not being taken away by this order.
Appeal disposed of
