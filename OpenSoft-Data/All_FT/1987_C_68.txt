23 February 1987
C.As. Nos. 500 to 516 of 1987 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) Nos. 7505 and 8647-8652 of 1983)
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1. Special leave granted in all the matters.
2. These appeals are concluded by the decision of this Court in Union of India v. Smt. Shanti Devi  1983 Indlaw SC 991983 Indlaw SC 991983 Indlaw SC 99 and must be allowed. In these cases, both the High Court as well as the learned Additional District Judge applied the twenty years' purchase rule for determining the compensation of these lands acquired under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in the years 1962 and 1963. In Smt. Shanti Devi case 1983 Indlaw SC 991983 Indlaw SC 991983 Indlaw SC 99, this Court has laid down that the proper multiplier to be adopted for the purpose of capitalisation based on the rate of return at the relevant date i.e. the dates of notifications issued under Section 4(1) of the Act in the years 1962 and 1963, would be 'fifteen' and that the courts were wrong in adopting the rule of twenty years' purchase.
3. Accordingly, the proper basis of fixing compensation in these cases being fifteen years' purchase, the compensation awarded for lands in these cases should be reduced by one-fourth.The claimants shall get solatium of 15 per cent on the compensation computed on the above basis on the aggregate amount from the date of taking possession of the land till the date of payment.
4. The result, therefore, is that the appeals must succeed and are allowed. The judgment and decrees of the courts below shall stand modified accordingly. Costs shall be borne by the parties as incurred.
Appeals allowed.
