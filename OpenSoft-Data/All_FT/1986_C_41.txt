Collector Of Central Excise, Bangalore v Bharat Earth Movers Ltd
Supreme Court of India

10 November 1986
C.A. No. 1408 of 1986, Dt. 10 November 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Delay in filing theappeal is condoned on condition that the appellant pay to the respondents as and by way of costs a sum of Rs.2500/- within 15 days from today. If this amount is not paid within 15 days from today, the appeal will stand dismissed with costs. We may point out that the only explanation for the delay which occurred in the Central Agency Section is that it is inadequately staffed. We have had occasions to point out that the Central Agency Section needs to be strengthened in order that the lawyers appearing for the Government of India and the other State Governments which are represented by the Central Agency Section should be able to attend to the cases promptly and satisfactorily and render proper assistance to the Court. We are told by the learned Additional Solicitor General that the Law Ministry has already taken a decision to increase the strength of lawyers in the Central Agency Section and the proposal has been sent to the Finance Ministry and is expected to be finalised in a couple of months.
2.   We must also point out that if the Central Agency Section is to be properly strengthened and the cases on behalf of the Government of India and the State Government are to be satisfactorily represented in Court, it is absolutely essential to improve the salary and conditions of service of the lawyers engaged in Central Agency Section so that really good talent is attracted, particularly since the cases in which the Government of India and the State Government are parties usually involved public interest and heavy stakes.
Order accordingly.
