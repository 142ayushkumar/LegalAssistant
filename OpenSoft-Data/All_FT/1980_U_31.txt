Chandroo Kundan Dass Pamnani v Union of India and Others Etc
Supreme Court of India

30 January 1980
Criminal Writ Petns. Nos. 1377 and 1377A of 1979, Dt. 30 January 1980.
The Judgment was delivered by: FAZAL ALI, J.
1.  The reasons that we have given in Writ Petition No. 1376 of 1979 which fully cover the present case where also there is an inordinate and unexplained delay in considering the representation filed by the detenu,
the writ petition is allowed and the order of detention passed against the petitioner is set aside and the petitioner-detenu is directed to be released forthwith.
2.  In view of our order releasing the detenu, Writ Petition No. 1377A/79, being a petition from jail, becomes infructuous and hence no orders need be passed in relation thereto.
Petition allowed.
