Rajinder Mittal v A.K. Garg & Ors.
Supreme Court of India

8 April 2011
SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRIMINAL) NO.2993 OF 2004
The Judgment was delivered by : Aftab Alam, J.
1.  This Special Leave Petition was filed against an interim order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi (for short "National Commission") on May 18, 2004 in Revision Petition No.3183 of 2003 filed there, on behalf of the petitioner. By the impugned order, the National Commission had rejected the petitioner's prayer for release on parole or bail pending final hearing of the Revision Petition and had directed him to surrender within one week from the date of the order.
2.  During the pendency of this SLP, the aforesaid revision, along with three others was taken up for hearing, and Revision Petition No.3183 of 2003 (from which this SLP arises) was dismissed by judgment and order dated May 24, 2010, passed by the National Commission.
3.  This renders the present SLP infructuous and it is dismissed as such. Consequently, any interim orders passed in the case are also vacated.
Petition dismissed
