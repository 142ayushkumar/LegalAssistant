1. Leave granted.
2. The appellants are before this Court aggrieved by the order passed by the High Court, staying the declaration of election of Director of respondent No.3-Bank in General Category.
3. It is seen that the interim orders have been passed just two days prior to voting. We find it difficult to agree with the stand taken by the High Court that the result of election should not be declared. Whether the writ petitions could have been entertained at all is a larger question to be considered by the High Court.
4. Be that as it may, the impugned interim orders dated 08.01.2016 in W.P.No.67/2016, W.P. No. 69/2016 and W.P. No.66/2016 passed by the High Court are, therefore, set aside. The Election Officer is directed to declare the results of the election which have been kept pending pursuant to the impugned order passed by the High Court, making it subject to the result of the final outcome of the writ petitions.
5. The appeals are allowed to the above extent with no order as to costs.
Appeals allowed
