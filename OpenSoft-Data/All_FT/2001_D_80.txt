State of Uttar Pradesh v Deepak Kumar Singh Jaiswal
Supreme Court of India

7 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8320/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Pursuant to certain selections made to the post of Assistant Engineers a Select List alongwith waiting list thereto was prepared by U.P. Public Services Commission in 1989 and on that basis a petition was filed before the High court for appointment of respondent No.1 to the post of Assistant Engineer. The High Court while disposing of the matter stated as follows:
"In view of this fact, we direct the Government to decide the representation and if the posts so notified are still vacant issue appointment order in favour of the petitioner in accordance with the ranking in the select list."
2.  Though a direction was made by the High Court that the Government will decide the representation to be made by respondent No. 1, the latter portion of the order that the appointment should be made in favour of the respondent in accordance with the ranking in the select list may not be appropriate and that part of the order shall stand set aside.
3. It is brought to our notice that now the representation made by the respondent having been rejected, a Writ petition has been filed in that regard, and we express no opinion on that aspect of the matter. The appeal shall stand disposed of subject to the observations made as above.
Appeal disposed of.
