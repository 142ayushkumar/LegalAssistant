Monarch Infrastructure Private Limited v Commnr., Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation and
Supreme Court of India

5 January 2001
I.A.No. 4 in C.A..No.3288/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Order made by us on 17.4.2000 is an interim order subject to final order and the matter was finally disposed of on 8.5.2000 wherein it was made clear as follows:
"Public interest in the present case would be definitely served by reason of showing the tender process to be completed by accepting the highest offer made by M/s Monarch Infrastructure (P) Ltd. subject to raising the bid to Rs. 42 crores matching with that of Ramchand Mahadeo Rao, though invalid, of Rs. 41,51,00,000/- for the period of 11 months which he is willing to raise of Rs. 42 crores. We are not allowing M/s Konark Infrastrucre (P) Ltd. or M/s Jai Krishna Infrastructure such an opportunity as they had made lower bid."
In this view of the matter, no further clarification is required.
I.A. No. 4 is, therefore, dismissed.
Application dismissed.
