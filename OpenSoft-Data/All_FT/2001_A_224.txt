Aps Star Industries Limited v Somdutt Builders Private Limited and Anr
Supreme Court of India

23 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6917/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Inasmuch a finding has been recorded by the learned Single Judge that invocation of the guarantee to make good the alleged losses on the basis of the alleged liablities of the STAR on account of penalty and/or inter-calaire interest appears to be fraudulent and the Division Bench opined that, as of present, the bank guarantee could not be allowed to be encashed by the appellant.
2.  We are of the view that it is not a fit case to interfere with the order under challenge under Article 136 of the Constitution.
The S.L.P. is therefore dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
