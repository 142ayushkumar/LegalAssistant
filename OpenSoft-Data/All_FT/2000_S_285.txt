Bankupalli Chinnababu v State By Its Public Prosecutor, A. P
Supreme Court of India

27 September 2000
Cr.A. No. 837 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We issued notice limited to the quantum of sentence. The appellant was convicted under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code and was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year. The amount involved in the criminal breach of trust was Rs. 23, 107. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the entire amount has been replenished to the person who is entitled. This submission is not disputed by the State. Learned counsel now submits that the appellant has already been in jail for 5 months and he pleaded that the sentence may be reduced to the period he has already undergone.
2. In view of the development that he repaid the entire amount, we are inclined to reduce the sentence to simple imprisonment for a period of 5 months. With this modification in the sentence this appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
