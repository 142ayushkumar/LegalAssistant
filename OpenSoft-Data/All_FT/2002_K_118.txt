The Government Of Andhra Pradesh & Ors v Kolluru Komaraiah & Ors
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2002
C.A. No. 6560 Of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The issue involved in this appeal relates to the interpretation of two Government Orders, being G.O.Ms. No.818 dated 21st July, 1972 and G.O.Ms. No. 139 dated 28th March, 1973. Both these Government Orders sought to give certain relief to those employees who were ex-Hyderabad State employees and who had reached the age of forty five years.
2.  Clearly, the employees who could have got the benefit of these Government Orders in 1972 and 1973, being aged forty five years, would presumably be not in employment now.
3. We do not think, in the facts and circumstances of the case, it is necessary to decide the issue raised in this appeal since it would be a purely academic exercise.
3 We, therefore, dismiss the appeal as having become infructuous, leaving the question of law open, without any order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
