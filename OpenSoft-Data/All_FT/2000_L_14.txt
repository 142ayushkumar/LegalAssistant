1. Heard the learned counsel for the parties. On the basis of the order dated 2.5.2000, learned counsel for the petitioners has verified the fact that possession of the land in question is already handed over to the petitioners.
However, it is his contention that in the revenue record, names of the petitioners are not mentioned. As against this, Mr. Rao, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents states that on 30.11.1999, mutation entry for the same has been posted and the copy of the said mutation entry is handed over to the learned counsel for the petitioners. In this view of the matter, these petitions would not survive.
2. Mr. P. Krishnamoorthi, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the intervenors submits that the petitioners had already transferred the aforesaid land in favour of one Mr. C. M. Abrahim in the year 1998 and the transfer is in violation of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act. In our view, in these contempt petitions filed by the petitioners, the contentions raised by the intervenors are not required to be dealt with and hence are not dealt with.
3. In the result, the contempt petitions stand disposed of accordingly and contempt notices shall stand discharged.
