The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  Great emphasis has been placed by learned counsel for the State of West Bengal upon the judgment of a Bench of three learned Judges in Goodricke Group Ltd. v. State of W.B. 1994 Indlaw SC 2182 Quite apart from the fact that there are pending proceedings in this Court seeking to reconcile the judgment in Goodricke 1994 Indlaw SC 2182 with that in State of Orissa v. Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. 1995 Indlaw SC 429  we find some difficulty in accepting as correct the view taken by Goodricke 1994 Indlaw SC 2182 particularly having regard to the earlier decision (of a Bench of two learned Judges) in Buxa Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. v. State of W.B.  1989 Indlaw SC 7171989 Indlaw SC 717.
2. We think, therefore, that these matters should be heard by a Constitution Bench.
3.  The papers and proceedings may, accordingly, be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate directions.
Order accordingly.
