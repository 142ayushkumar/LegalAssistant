AVI Autos Limited v Commissioner of Customs, Bombay
Supreme Court of India

1 August 2001
C.A. No. 4081 of 1991
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have perused the order of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal and are in agreement with the said decision wherein it has been held that the benefit of exemption notification could not be availed of by the appellant and the same was only available for import inter alia by association of owners.
2.  The appellant was an individual importer and not an association and, therefore, it could not avail of the benefit of exemption notification, especially in view of the fact that there was absence of certificate from the Department of Industrial Development as contemplated by the exemption notification.
The appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
