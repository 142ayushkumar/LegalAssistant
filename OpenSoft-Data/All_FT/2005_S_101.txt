The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  One of the points involved in this appeal is similar to the point which has been referred to a three-Judge Bench in Shakuntla Devi v. Kamla  in view of the seemingly conflicting views taken by this Court in Teg Singh v. Charan Singh 1977 Indlaw SC 239, Kesar Singh v. Sadhu 1996 Indlaw SC 3162 and Balwant Singh v. Daulat Singh 1997 Indlaw SC 1656.
2.  The appeal be listed after the decision by a three-Judge Bench in Shakuntla Devi case (supra).
3. However, the parties shall be at liberty to make an application before the three-Judge Bench hearing the case for rendering assistance on the point referred.
Order accordingly.
