Criminal Appeal No(s). 1480 of 2009
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  These applications, being CRLMP.NO. 21374 & 21375/2009, have been filed on behalf of the appellant in a disposed of matter, for clarification/modification of the order dated 10th August,, 2009, by which Crl.A. No.1480 of 2009 had been disposed of. In our said order, the sentence had been reduced from two years to the minimum punishment of six months under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and from three years to the minimum punishment of one year under Section 13(1)(d) and 13(2) of the aforesaid Act.
2. While passing the said order, it appears that we had not mentioned as to whether the said sentences were to run consecutively or concurrently, although, the trial court had done so.
3.  We, therefore, clarify our order to the extent that the two sentences in respect of the two offences shall run concurrently.
The applications are disposed of, accordingly.
Application disposed of
