Commissioner Of Central Excise, N. D. v AGI Switches (Private) Limited
Supreme Court of India

15 February 2005
C.A. No. 5579 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having regard to the decision of this Court in CCE v. Bhalla Enterprises 2004 Indlaw SC 996 we see no reason to interfere with the decision of the Tribunal, particularly when the respondent has produced a copy of its registration under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 in respect of the mark the brand name in question. It is not in dispute that the registration if genuine covers the entire period in question.
2. It is being made clear that if subsequently it is found that this is an incorrect statement made by the respondent, it will be open to the learned counsel for the appellant to draw the same to our attention. The appeal is dismissed accordingly.
Appeal dismissed.
