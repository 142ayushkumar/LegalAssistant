C.A. No. 2411 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 26416 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
Heard parties.
1.  By the impugned Order, which is dated 5th July, 2004, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has dismissed the Revision Petition against an Order of the State Forum which increased interest of 18% p.a. This Court has already in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Balbir Singh reported in  2004 Indlaw SC 941 held that award of interest at the blanket rate is not justified.

3.  The Commission is requested to dispose of the Revision Petition as expeditiously as possible.
Appeal disposed of.
