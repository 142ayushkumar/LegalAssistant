Dashrath Champa and Others v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

9 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.) 6780/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Application for exemption from filing Official Translation is allowed.
Leave granted.
1.  We have perused the post-mortem report and we prima-facie feel that death cannot be attributed to any of the ante-mortem injuries noted by the doctor who conducted the autopsy.
2. Even otherwise the conviction under Section 304 Part I, Indian Penal Code 
is prima facie unsustainable assuming the reasoning of the High Court for bringing down the offence to culpable homicide not amounting to murder can be accepted as correct.
For the aforesaid reasons we allow interim bail for the appellants on their executing a bond before the trial court each for such amount as the trial judge may fix with two solvent sureties to his satisfaction.
Order accordingly.
