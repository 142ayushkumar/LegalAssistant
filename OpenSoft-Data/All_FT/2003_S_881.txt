Dinesh Chandra Srivastava and another v Sushil Chandra Dwivedi and others
Supreme Court of India

24 March 2003
C.As. Nos. 2403-04 of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 18545-46 of 2002)
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  On 6-11-1995, an order was issued by the State Government in exercise of powers under Rules 37(3), of the U.P. Development Authority Centralised Rules, 1985 by which the past services rendered by Respondent 1, before us were to be counted for the purpose of seniority. This order was challenged by the appellants under Article 226 WP No. 1166 (S/B) of 1995, On 3-5-1996, the appellants writ petition was admitted and the operation of the order dated 6-11-1995, was stayed.
2. While the writ petition was pending, a second order was passed by the State Government on 3-2-1997, by which it recalled the earlier order dated 6-11-1995. Aggrieved by the order dated 3-2-1997, Respondent 1, filed a writ petition challenging that order WP No. 198 (S/B) of 1997 dated 27-2-1997.
3.  By the impugned judgment Respondent 1, writ application was allowed on the ground that the order dated 3-2-1997, was passed without giving an opportunity of hearing to Respondent 1. The obvious consequence of setting aside the order dated 3-2-1997, was that the earlier order issued dated 6-11-1995, revived. That being so, it was incumbent upon the High Court to have decided the appellants challenge to the order dated 6-11-1995, in their writ petition, namely, WP No. 1166 of 1995.
Instead of that, the High Court held:
"Since the order dated 6-11-1995, has been cancelled by a subsequent order dated 3-2-1997, Writ Petition No. 1166/MB of 1995, has become infructuous."
4.  This was clearly erroneous. In the circumstances of the case the appeal is allowed by setting aside the aforesaid quoted finding of the High Court. Writ Petition No. 1166 of 1995, filed by the appellants must be heard and disposed of on merits by the High Court. It is pointed out by learned counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent 1, that the State Government has since amended the Rules, in connection with the fixation of seniority. We are not expressing any view on the merits of the case of either party. It will be open to the respondents to raise whatever points as are available to them before the High Court and the appellants will be at liberty to deal with the same as they may be advised.
5. The appeals are disposed of. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
