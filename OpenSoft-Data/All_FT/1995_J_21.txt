Union of India v Jagdish and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 March 1995
Appeal (Civil) 4188 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows :
CA, No. 4188/95 (@ SLP 740/95)
Leave granted.
Notification under s.4(l) of the Land Acquisition Act was published in the Gazette on November 1, 1978. The award of the Collector bears No. 26 of 1980-81. Therefore, the award is made well before the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 68/1984 came into force on September 24, 1984. In consequence, the claimants are not entitled to get the additional amount payable at the rate of 12% per annum under s.23(1-A) for the period between the date of the notification and the date of the award or the date of taking possession whichever is earlier; yet the same is awarded by the High Court. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. The judgment to the extent of grant of additional amount under s.23(l-A) stands set aside. In other respects, the judgment stands confirmed. No costs. CA. NO. 4189/95 (@SLP 8736194 (CC 28723)
Admittedly, the notification under s.4(l) of the Land Acquisition Act was published on June 4, 1977. The award of the Collector under s.11 was made on 22.7.81, i.e. before s.23 (1-A) of the Land Acquisition Act as amended by Amendment Act 68/84 had come into force.
1. Under those circumstances, the claimants are not entitled to the payment of additional amount at 12% per annum under s.23(l-A) on such market value for the period commencing on and from the date of the publication of the notification under s.4(l) in respect of such land to the date of the award of the Collector or the date of the taking possession of the land whichever is earlier. Since the award of the Collector was earlier in point of time to the date of the Amendment Act coming into force, the respondent is not entitled to the additional amount as envisaged under s.23(l-A). The High Court, therefore, was not right in awarding the additional amount. The appeal is allowed and the decree to the extent of awarding additional amount under s.23(l-A) is set aside. In other respects, the award as upheld by the High Court, stands confirmed. No costs.
Appeal allowed
