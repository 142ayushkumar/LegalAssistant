Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited v Customs Excise Gold Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai
Supreme Court of India

30 August 2001
C.A. Nos. 6588-6590 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question in these appeals relates to the valuation of physicians samples for the purposes of excise duty. It has been the case of the assessee that the cost of the physicians samples is already included in the cost of the drugs that are for sale. In support of this contention a "cost certificate" was prepared by the appellant and placed before the Tribunal. This is noted in the order of the Tribunal which is under appeal.
2. But the Tribunal found that "all these aspects are adequately answered in the Tribunal's order" which is now reported, namely Cheryl Laboratories (P) Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, Hyderabad 1997 Indlaw CEGAT 23644. It does not appear that this contention was considered by the Tribunal in that latter judgment.
3.  It, therefore, becomes necessary to set aside the order of the Tribunal and remit the matter to the Tribunal to be considered afresh for determination of the facts first and thereafter the law relevant to the issue.
The appeals are allowed accordingly.
No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
