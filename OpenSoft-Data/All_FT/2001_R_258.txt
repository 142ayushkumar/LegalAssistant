The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal is directed against the order rejecting the application for restoration of the second appeal dismissed in default. We are satisfied that the cause shown by the appellant for the restoration of appeal is sufficient.
2. We, therefore, set aside the order under challenge and send the case back to the High Court to decide the appeal on merits.
3.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
