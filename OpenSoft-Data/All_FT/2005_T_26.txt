Tata Cummins Limited and another v State of Jharkhand and others
Supreme Court of India

18 April 2005
Transfer Petition (C) No. 757 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
We have heard counsel for the parties.
1.  It appears to us from the perusal of the documents placed before us that the issues involved in Tata Cummins Ltd. v. State of Jharkhand pending before the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi are similar, if not identical, to the issues raised in State of Jharkhand v. Tata Cummins Ltd. and Tata Cummins Ltd. v. State of Jharkhand .The questions involved relate, inter alia, to the exemption granted under the Bihar Industrial Policy, 1995.
2.  Counsel for the State submitted that he has an objection to raise as to the maintainability of the writ petition itself.
3. The right of a party to raise such objections as he wishes to raise is not lost by transfer of the case from the High Court to this Court. It is always open to the respondent to raise such objections before this Court as it could raise before the High Court.
4.  Under the circumstances, we allow this transfer petition and transfer Writ Petition (T) No. 3094 of 2004 pending in the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi to this Court, to be heard along with Civil Appeal No. 10272 of 2003 and Civil Appeal No. 1066 of 2004.
Petition allowed.
