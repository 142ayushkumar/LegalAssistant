Mahadevappa v Siddappa (dead) by LRs and others
Supreme Court of India

13 July 2004
C.A. Nos. 3135-3136 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  By the impugned order dated 27.5.1998 the learned single Judge of the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore, hearing the Second Appeals has reversed the concurrent findings recorded by the courts below without framing a substantial question of law as required under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).
2.  This Court in a catena of decisions including in the case of M.S.V. Raja and another vs. Seeni Thevar and others 2001 Indlaw SC 20033, has held that the High Court can exercise its jurisdiction under Section 100 CPC only on the basis of substantial questions of law arising in the appeal and the Second Appeal has to be heard and decided only on the basis of the substantial questions of law. A judgment rendered by the High Court under Section 100 CPC without following the aforesaid procedure is not sustainable in law.
As indicated above, in the present case, the High Court has assumed jurisdiction under Section 100 CPC without framing a substantial question of law. On this short ground, the appeals are accepted. The impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the case is remitted back to the High Court for a fresh decision in accordance with law. The High Court will proceed with the matter only after framing substantial questions of law, if any, in the appeal.
3.  The Registry is directed to remit the record of this case to the High Court forthwith. Since the Regular Second Appeals pertain to the year 1991, we would request the High Court to take up the matter and dispose it of as soon as possible in accordance with law. These appeals accordingly stand allowed. Interim stay granted by this Court on 2.11.1998 stands vacated.
Appeals allowed.
