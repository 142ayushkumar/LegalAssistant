Kiran Singh, daughter of Shri Anand Partap Singh, now residing at Baranndha on S.A. My age is 18/19 years. I was studying in C.M.P. Degree College at Allahabad. I am very scared of this boy who is threatening me to go with him. He says, if you refuse to be my companion I will shoot you and throw bomb to destroy you and your parents and brothers. He have this threat by a letter and he had also orally threatened so when I was at Allahabad. His friend Bimal Roy is residing as a tenant of my father's house at 4, Minto Park, Allahabad. The respondent Akhil often says that if I go with him he will get the house at 4, Minto Park. This was his plan which he had hatched in concert with Bimal Roy and others. Akhil had disclosed this plan to me while inducing me to go with him. I never married Akhil or chose him as my life partner.
