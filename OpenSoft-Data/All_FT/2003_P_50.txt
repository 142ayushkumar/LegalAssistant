Collector Of Central Excise, Pune v Paranjape Metal Shaper (P) Ltd
Supreme Court of India

11 March 2003
C.A. Nos. 1577-1578 of 1998 with C.A. No. 2512 of 1998, Dt. 11 March 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals are against the order dated 22nd August,1997, passed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT). The question was whether sand, to which a quoting of resin is applied, becomes a manufactured item. The Tribunal has held that if it is used for captive consumption then no duty would be payable but that if it is sold then duty would be payable.
2. We find that the decision of the Tribunal is covered by Notification No. 217/86-C.E., dated 2nd April,1986, which exempts sand used in the manufacture of casting provided it is used for captive consumption. We, therefore, find no infirmity in the impugned judgment. We see no reason to interfere with the impugned order.
Appeals are accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
