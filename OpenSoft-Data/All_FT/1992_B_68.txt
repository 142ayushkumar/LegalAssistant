Supreme Court of India

17 September 1992
C.A. No. 3803/1992,
The Judgment was delivered by: VENKATACHALA, J.
1.  This petition for special leave to appeal arises from an Order dated the February 15, 1989 of the Patna High Court in Writ Petition, CWJC No. 5954 of 1987. The petitioner who was in the service of the State Government had impugned in that Writ Petition, an Order of the Director of the Directorate of freedom Fighters of the Government of Bihar, by which his claim for extension of service by two years based on Bihar State Government's Notification dated May 31, 1983, had been refused.
But, the High Court dismissed that Writ Petition by its Order dated February 15, 1989, on the sole ground that a Division Bench of that Court in CWJC No. 953 of 1988 had nullified the Notification of the State Government on which petitioner's claim had been based. The present SLP has been filed respecting that Order of the High Court.
