Supreme Court of India

24 September 2002
C.A. No. 686 of 1995 with C.A. No. 4851 of 2000, Dt. 24 September 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Civil Appeal No. 686 of 1995:
1.  The short question that arises for consideration in this appeal, filed by the Collector of Central Excise, Bangalore, against the Final Order, No. E-194/1994, of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No. E/1319/92-B dated 30th March, 1994 is,
"whether the product 'Signal Conditioning Amplifiers' is classifiable under sub-heading 85.18 or under sub-heading 90.30 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 "
2.  The Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, after an elaborate discussion on construing the evidence, came to the conclusion that based on the Section Note (Note 2(a) of Section XVIII), it was left in no doubt that in view of the overwhelming opinion of the experts brought on record that the product of the respondent herein would be classifiable under Tariff Heading 90.30 because Signal Conditioning Amplifiers are principally used with Oscilloscopes, which are specifically mentioned in the said Heading 90.30.
3.  Having heard Mr. S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel appearing for the Revenue, and upon perusing the well reasoned order under challenge, we are of the view that no exception can be taken to the order under challenge.
The civil appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.
No costs.
Civil Appeal No. 4851 of 2000:
4.  In view of the dismissal of Civil Appeal No. 686 of 1995, this appeal is also dismissed.
