Commissioner of Income Tax v Dharmodayam Company
Supreme Court of India

21 November 2000
C.A. Nos. 6083 & 6298 of 1997
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The assessment years here involved are 1984-85 and 1985-86. Until the introduction of s. 11(4A) into the IT Act, 1961 , on 1st April, 1984, the case of the assessee was governed by the decision of this Court in its own case of CIT vs. Dharmodayam Co. 1977 Indlaw SC 216.
2. Sec. 11(4A) has introduced conditions in the application of sub-ss. (1), (2), (3) and (3A) of s. 11. It does not appear that the Tribunal has applied its mind to these conditions and given findings of fact as to whether or not they are satisfied. Nor has the High Court given due consideration to this aspect. To be able to decide whether the assessee is entitled to the benefit of the exemption under s. 11. It is necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether it satisfies the requirements of s. 11(4A).
3.  Accordingly, the orders of the High Court under challenge and the orders of the Tribunal from which the reference was made are set aside and the matters (ITA No. 681/Coch/1987 and ITA No. 264/Coch/1989) are restored to the file of the Tribunal, Cochin, to be considered afresh in the light of what has been stated above.
The appeals are allowed accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
