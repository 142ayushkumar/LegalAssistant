1.  This is a petition which challenges an interim order of the High Court which is a detailed order giving reasons why the High Court has, prima facie, taken the view it has.
2. In view of the reasons so given, we do not see any reason to intervene at this stage since this is only against an interim order. Hence the Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
