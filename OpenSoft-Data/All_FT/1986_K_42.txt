Krishna Vasudev Baliga and Another v Kusum Murthy and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 November 1986
W.P. No. 3829 of 1986 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 9 October 1986 of the High Court of Bombay in W.P. No. 3829 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are told that respondents 1 and 2 having given an undertaking before City Civil Court Bombay to vacate the premises by September 9, 1986 have filed a petition before the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India read with Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code.
2.   Respondents 1 and 2, in the circumstances, should be called upon by the High Court to state before it whether they would like to continue the petition under Article 226 of the Constitution Constitution of India or Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code.
3.  Petitioners are at liberty to make a fresh application before the High Court to reconsider the question of interim stay which has been made by the High Court. We feel that, in any event, the main case itself should be disposed of as expeditiously as possible but not later than three months, since it is stated that the petition is filed notwithstanding the undertaking given by the respondents.
4.  The petitioner shall file an application before the High Court bringing to its notice the order passed by us for appropriate directions with regard to the election regarding the remedy as well as the actual date of hearing.
5.  We express no opinion on the merits of the case. Subject to the above observations, the special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
