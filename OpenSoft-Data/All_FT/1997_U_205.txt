Sriwas Charan Biswal and Others v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 March 1997
C.As. Nos. 1950-61 of 1997.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  It was the case of the respondents before the Tribunal that none of the appellants had filed appeals. The Tribunal proceeded to consider whether the judgment of this Court in the case of Union of India v. R. Reddappa, 1993 Indlaw SC 16811993 Indlaw SC 16811993 Indlaw SC 1681 applied to the appellants, regardless of whether or not they had filed such appeals. It is clear from  the judgment in R. Reddappa case  1993 Indlaw SC 16811993 Indlaw SC 16811993 Indlaw SC 1681, that the ratio therein would apply to those cases where
"the claim petitions have been dismissed because the appeals filed had already been dismissed."
2. To get the benefit of the judgment in R. Reddappa case  1993 Indlaw SC 16811993 Indlaw SC 16811993 Indlaw SC 1681, therefore, the appellants must be such persons whose claim petitions had been dismissed because the appeals filed had already been dismissed and this is a matter which will require an investigation on facts.
3.  The appeals are, accordingly, allowed and the order under appeal is set aside. The various original applications (OAs Nos. 248 to 254 of 1994, 265 to 267 of 1994 and 269-270 of 1994) shall be restored to the file of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta, for being considered afresh, having regard to the observations made above and the decision of this Court aforementioned. No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
