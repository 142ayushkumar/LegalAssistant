Bansi Lal v State of Madhya Pradesh and another
Supreme Court of India

10 February 1981
Cr.A. No. 104 of 1981
The Judgement was given by: A.C.Gupta, J.
1.  It appears that in the same case in respect of two other accused this Court acquitted those accused persons by an Order dated October 3, 1980 in Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 1976. On perusal of the judgment referred to above we are satisfied that the case against the appellant as against the accused acquitted by this Court is exactly the same and this Court rejected the case of the prosecution in its entirety.
There is thus no legal evidence to support the conviction. The appeal is accordingly allowed and the appellant acquitted. The appellant will be set at liberty forthwith and if he is on bail he will be discharged from bail.
Appeal Allowed.
