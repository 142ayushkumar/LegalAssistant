Enforcement Officer, Ted, Bombay v Bher Chand Tikaji Bora and Another
Supreme Court of India

9 April 1999
Cr.A. No. 418 of 1999 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 3526 of 1998)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The Enforcement Directorate is in appeal before us against the order of the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court granting anticipatory bail to the respondent invoking jurisdiction u/s. 438 of 
 CrPC. From a bare reading of the impugned order it appears that the learned Single Judge is of the view that because the respondent was available for interrogation and the prosecution did not avail of that opportunity there should not be any justification for not granting the anticipatory bail sought for.
2. We have no hesitation to hold that the learned Judge has misread the decision of this Court referred to in the impugned order. The criteria and questions to be considered for exercising power u/s. 438 of 
 CrPC has been recently dealt with in Dukhishyam Benupani, Asstt. Director, Enforcement Directorate (FERA) v. Arun Kumar Bajoria 1997 Indlaw SC 17291997 Indlaw SC 1729 The white-collar criminal like the respondent against whom the allegation is that he has violated the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act is a menace to the society and therefore unless he alleges and establishes in the materials that he is being unnecessarily harassed by the investigating agency, the Court would not be justified in invoking jurisdiction u/s. 438 
 CrPC and granting anticipatory bail.
3.  In the facts and circumstances of the present case, in our considered opinion, the High Court was wholly unjustified in invoking jurisdiction u/s. 438 and granting anticipatory bail to the respondent. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order of the High Court. The appeal is accordingly allowed.
Appeal allowed.
