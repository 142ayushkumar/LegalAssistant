1.  The issue involved in these appeals is similar to that of Civil Appeal Nos. 6-7 of 1998 and Civil Appeal Nos. 4-5 of 1998. In these cases, the Central Administrative Tribunal had allowed the O.A. filed by some of the respondents following its earlier judgment and order dated 5.11.1996 given in O.A. No. 199/1996 and O.A. No. 214/1996 and the writ petition filed by the appellants challenging the said order was dismissed by the Madras High Court.
2.  For the reasons given in Civil Appeal Nos. 6-7 of 1998 etc. these appeals are allowed and the impugned judgment and order of the Central Administrative Tribunal (Madras Bench) is set aside.
Appeal dismissed
