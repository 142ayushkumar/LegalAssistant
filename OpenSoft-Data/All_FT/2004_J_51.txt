The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.

On trial, the petitioner was found guilty. He was convicted and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a period of one year.
"During the pendency of the proceedings before this Court in these appeals, the brother and sister have settled the dispute. The petitioner has already undergone the sentence for a period of one month. In these circumstances, the learned counsel, on either side, submitted that the sentence already undergone by the petitioner may be considered sufficient, taking note of the settlement arrived at between the brother and the sister and the order of sentence may be modified to that extent."
