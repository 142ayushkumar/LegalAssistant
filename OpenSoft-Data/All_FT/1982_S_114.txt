The wholesale dealer's licence for the entire city of Madras was issued to one M. Subbarama Reddy, the 3rd respondent in W.P. No. 6797 of 1981 and not to any of the writ petitioners. The writ petitions were filed in these circumstances.

4.  The arguments in these writ petitions and Civil Appeals Nos. 3035-3037 of 1981 were heard in part and all these matters were adjourned to March 23, 1982. Subsequent to March 23, 1982, probably in the light of the arguments advanced before us in these matters till that date the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937 has been amended by the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Amendment Act 42 of 1982. Some of the aforesaid Tamil Nadu Liquor (Licence and Permit) Rules, 1960 also have been amended. The wholesale licence granted to M. Subbarama Reddy, the 3rd respondent in W.P. No. 6797 of 1981 for the whole of Madras city has also been cancelled. When these said writ petitions and civil appeals came up again before us on September 14, 1982, Mr K. Rajendra Chowdhary, learned counsel for the appellants in the aforesaid civil appeals in which also similar relief as in these writ petitions were prayed for, withdrew those civil appeals and they were accordingly dismissed as withdrawn on that day without costs. Then Dr. Y.S. Chitale, learned counsel appearing for the Government of Tamil Nadu submitted that by reasons of the said amendment of some of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937 and also the said Tamil Nadu Liquor (Licence and Permit) Rules, 1960 nothing survives in these writ petitions for consideration by this Court. This was not disputed by Mr F.S. Nariman, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in these writ petitions.
5.  He, however, submitted that Rule 3 of the Tamil Nadu Indian-made Foreign Spirits (Supply by Wholesale) Rules, 1981 confers the power to fix the number of wholesale depots for Indian-made foreign spirits in Tamil Nadu on the Commissioner of Prohibition subject to the approval of the Government and only one wholesale depot has been fixed for each of the districts in Tamil Nadu, and an opportunity should be given to the petitioners in these writ petitions to make representation to the Government regarding the number of wholesale depots for Indian-made foreign spirits required in each of the districts. He also submitted that the Notification calling for application for the issue of licence for dealing with Indian-made foreign spirits may be issued within four weeks after representation are made by the writ petitioners to the Government. Dr. Y.S. Chitale, learned counsel appearing for the Government of Tamil Nadu had no objection to these submissions of the learned counsel for the writ petitioners.
6. In these circumstances, we dismiss these writ petitions. While doing so we give liberty to writ petitioners to make representation in writing to the Government of Tamil Nadu regarding the number of wholesale depots for Indian-made foreign spirits in each of the districts in Tamil Nadu including the Madras Corporation limits within two weeks from September 15, 1982. The Government of Tamil Nadu shall consider these representations, if any, without necessity for giving an oral hearing to these petitioners. The notification calling for the issue of licences for wholesale dealers in Indian-made foreign spirits shall be issued within four weeks from October 1, 1982. It is open to the writ petitioners also to submit their applications for grant of licences to them and they shall be considered on merits according to law. We do not make any order as to costs.
7.  The Government of Tamil Nadu may consider the question of purchasing either by themselves or through any of their agents the stock of Indian-made foreign spirit which may be left with the writ petitioners after the fresh licences are granted on the new applications which may be invited for the purpose.
Petitions disposed of.
