Sewa Ram v State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr
Supreme Court of India

26 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 965/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Petitioner is a Government servant. He has filed the petition before the High Court for quashing the complaint containing certain offences for which no anticipatory bail is provided. We are not inclined to disturb the impugned order as it is open to the petitioner to raise all his contentions in the trial court.
2. Though, the High Court has observed that when he approaches the court for bail the court concerned shall take into consideration his predicaments and pass appropriate orders.
3.  We may further observe that if the petitioner surrenders and applies for bail before the court concerned he shall be released on bail on executing a bond to the satisfaction of the said court.
With these observations this Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
