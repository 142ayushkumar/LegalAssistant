Viral Filaments Limited and Anr v Ceat Financial Services Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The only prayer made in this petition is that one case pending before the Chief Metropolitan Court, Calcutta be transferred to a Court at Mumbai. It is submitted that the complainant and all the other respondents are residents of Mumbai and hence the transfer to Mumbai will not cause any inconvenience to the respondents as that transfer would be beneficial to the petitioner also.
2. After hearing both sides, we are inclined to accept the submission that transfer would not cause any inconvenience to the respondents. We are told that some other cases are pending in the courts at Mumbai as between the parties relating to the issuance of cheques.
3.  Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the transfer should not be misunderstood by any party concerned as having been made accepting the contention of the respondent-complainant regarding jurisdiction of the Court. There is no necessity for entertaining any such apprehension since we do not express anything on the merits of the case.
4.  We, therefore order Criminal Complaint No.C/4148/1999 entitled M/s Ceat Financial Services Ltd. vs. Viral Filaments Limited and Ors. be transferred to Addl.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 9th Court, Bandra, Mumbai.
The transfer petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
