Nisha Mishra Kumar v Pankaj Kumar Singh
Supreme Court of India

10 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6721/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The dispute is in regard to the quantum of maintenance payable by the respondent-husband to the petitioner. The High Court reduced to Rupees one thousand per month the amount that had been fixed by the trial court at Rupees three thousand per month on the basis that there was lack of evidence regarding the actual income of the respondent from landed property.
We have heard learned counsel.
2. In our view, the order of the High Court cannot be sustained. We think that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the respondent should pay to the petitioner maintenance in the sum of Rupees two thousand and five hundred per month commencing from the date of the application, i.e., 4th April, 1994. The arrears of maintenance shall be paid within twelve weeks.
Order on the appeal accordingly. No order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
