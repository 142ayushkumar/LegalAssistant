New India Assurance Company Limited v Chanda and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil).../2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner New India Assurance Company submits that the company is not disputing the quantum of compensation fixed by the Division Bench in the impugned order as the same cannot be disputed by the Assurance Company. But all that learned counsel contends is that the liability of the Assurance Company should have been reduced to the limit fixed in the Policy.
2.  We have not find from the impugned judgment that the said point has been raised before the Division Bench. It is open to the Assurance Company to file a review petition before the High Court in that regard.
3. Learned counsel submits that the Assurance Company would be advised to do so. To afford this opportunity to the petitioner Assurance Company, we dismiss this SLP as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
