Pratyush Kumar Jana v Deputy Registrar of Trademarks and Others
Supreme Court of India

12 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15188/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for respondent No. 3 has placed before us an order dated 22nd January, 2001 passed by the Joint Registrar of Trade Marks whereby the application of the petitioner for registration of the trade mark has been rejected.
2. The present special leave petition arises from the order whereby the petitioner's objection to the registration of the same trade mark in the name of respondent No. 3 was rejected. This decision was upheld by the Single Judge and the Division Bench. In view of the order of 22nd January, 2001, prima facie the right of the petitioner in this petition to challenge the impugned judgment would not survive.
3.  However, as he has a right of appeal against the order dated 22nd January, 2001, we dispose of this special leave petition by directing that if at any point of time the order dated 22nd January, 2001 is set aside and registration granted in favour of the petitioner, then the petitioner will have a right to apply for revival of this special leave petition.
Petition disposed of.
