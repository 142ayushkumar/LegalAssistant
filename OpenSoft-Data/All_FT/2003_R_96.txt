Ram Lal v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

7  May  2003
Cr.A. No. 709 of 2003 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 259 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard both sides.
1.  The appellant herein was convicted for the offence punishable under Section 326 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860. The appellant had caused injuries to two persons and the conviction was on two counts. The High Court was pleased to order that the conviction for imprisonment for 3 years on two counts shall run consecutively and not concurrently.
Aggrieved by the same, the appellant filed this appeal from jail.
2.  The offence committed by the appellant is of serious nature and the prayer now made by the appellant is that the sentence shall run concurrently i.e. the total period shall be 3 years. We are not inclined to accept this contention.
3. Therefore we reduce the sentence of imprisonment from 3 years to 2 years for the offence under Section 326 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 on two counts and order that it shall run consecutively i.e. the total period shall be 4 years.
The appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
