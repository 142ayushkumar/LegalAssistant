The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel states that according to Rule 32 Clause (iii) of the P and T Manual for the purpose of promotion when Guntur Division forms part of a wider area the original seniority is to come. This contention does not seem to have been urged either before the Tribunal or before the High Court because neither of the two Courts have dealt with it.
2. Petitioner wishes to withdrawn this Special Leave Petition with a view to approach any of the said authorities.
The Special Leave Petition is dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
