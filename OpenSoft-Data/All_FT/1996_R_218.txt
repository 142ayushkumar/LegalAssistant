Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, West Bengal and Another v Delta Jute and Industries Limited and Another
Supreme Court of India

1 November 1996
C.A. No. 14167 of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. No. 859 of 1995)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Although it appears to us that the order passed by the learned trial Judge was not couched in such a manner for which it can be inferred that it is a consent order, but it appears to us that after considering the facts and circumstances of the case and presumably after keeping in view the provision of Section 14-B of the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the learned trial Judge passed the order for making payment of arrear dues in instalments with a direction that no interest or damages should be charged.
2.  In the facts of the case and also considering the fact that after a scheme was prepared by this Court, the respondent Company, which was a sick industry, has revived and has paid both the current and arrear dues of provident fund contribution in instalments without any default.
3.   In the special facts of the case, it will not be desirable to direct for payment of interest and damages as claimed so that the process of revival is again put to jeopardy. Considering the provisions of Section 14-B of the said Act and also the facts of the case, we do not intend to interfere with the impugned order. This appeal is accordingly disposed of without any order as to costs
Appeal disposed of.
