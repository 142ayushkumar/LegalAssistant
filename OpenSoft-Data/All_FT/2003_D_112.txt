The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied by the judgment and order dated 15th December 2000 passed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No. E/2030/2000-NB and the modified order dated 11th May 2001, reducing penalty, the assessee has preferred these appeals.
2. At the time of hearing of these matters, learned Counsel for the appellant has relied upon three subsequent decisions rendered by the Tribunal taking contrary view than the view which is taken in this matter interpreting Rule 57G(5) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944. The decision relied upon by the learned Counsel for the appellant are as follows:
"1. Bullows Paint Equipment Pvt. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai-VI 2001 Indlaw CEGAT 2362.
2. Phoenix Industries Ltd. v. Commr. of Central Excise, Meerut 2001 Indlaw CEGAT 1069 and
3. Hamco Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise and Customs, Swat ' 2001 Indlaw CEGAT 1845."
Further, as Rule 57G(3)(c) is not clear, the Board has issued clarifica- tion by Circular dated 26th November, 1996.
4. Hence, this would be a fit case for remitting the matter to the Tribunal for deciding afresh in accordance with law. It is made clear that the questions raised in these appeals are left open.
5. The appeals are disposed of, accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
