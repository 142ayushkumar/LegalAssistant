Chandravati Manohar Shetty and Another v Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited and Another
Supreme Court of India

30 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20419/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  After admitting the appeal from order, by an interim order, the High Court issued an injunction in terms of prayer clause (a) of Civil Application till the disposal of the appeal. That order is challenged by filing this appeal.
2.  Admittedly, the dispute is between two sisters. In the suit filed by respondent No.2, the City Civil Court, Mumbai has not granted interim injunction as prayed for.
3.  Hence, respondent No.2 preferred appeal from order before the High Court. At the time of admission of the said appeal, the High Court admitted the appeal and granted interim injunction as prayed for. Undisputedly, the appellants are in possession of the premises and that there was a telephone booth in the said premises. By the impugned injunction order MTNL is restrained from giving telephone connection to run a a public communication centre.
4. In this set of circumstances, particularly when the appellants were in possession of the suit premises before granting interim injunction the High Court ought to have fixed the matter for final hearing. By grant of this injunction, the High Court has virtually allowed the appeal without disposing of it on merits.Hence, the impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. The High Court to decide the appeal from order on merits as early as possible. Appeal stands disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
