The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. This Court on 2.11.2006 noticed that of in all 173 persons who have either dead or missing in the riots that had taken place in the City of Bombay in 1993. Out of them, 44 dependents/claimants had received compensation and the whereabouts of many other dead or missing persons were not known and their dependents have come forward to claim compensation. The cases of 124 persons are pending with the Government.
2. Learned counsel for the State submitted that many of these applicants are not eligible as they are not really dependents of the dead or others are not really missing. The details of the dead or missing persons are not available so far. We direct the Additional Chief Secretary (Home), State of Maharashtra, to look into the matter and consider whether any one of them are really entitled to get any compensation and he would be at liberty to seek clarification from the concerned persons who are included in the list of 124 persons and whether they are eligible to get compensation. A decision in this regard shall be taken within a period of three months.
The applicants would be at liberty to approach the Additional Chief Secretary (Home), State of Maharashtra, and they are entitled to furnish any details regarding the dead or missing persons to prove the identity and also to prove that they are really the dependents of such persons. A final decision taken in the matter should be communicated to each of the applicants and a copy of the decision taken shall be furnished to this Court on or before 28.3.2007. List after three weeks thereafter.
Order accordingly
