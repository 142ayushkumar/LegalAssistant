Commissioner Of Central Excise, Kerala v Binani Zinc Limited
Supreme Court of India

20 October 2009
C.A. Nos. 7045-7046 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  These appeals under Section 35(1)(b) of the Central Excise Act, 1944, are directed against the final orders dated 30-5-2002 passed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, South Zonal Bench, Bangalore, Karnataka (for short the Tribunal) in appeals No. E/2364/98 and 2365/1998.
2.  By the impugned order, relying on the decision of the Larger Bench of the Tribunal in the case of  Wyeth Laboratories v. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay , the Tribunal has allowed the appeals preferred by the assessee. The Tribunal has held that the assessee was entitled to clear partially used Aluminium Cathodes under Rule 57F (2) of the Central Excise Rules, 1944.
3.  When the appeals came up for hearing on 9th September, 2009, the learned Additional Solicitor General sought time to seek instructions with regard to the status of the decision of the Larger Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Wyeth Laboratories (supra) inasmuch as whether the said decision had been challenged by the Revenue or not.
4.  Learned counsel appearing for the Revenue states that as per his instructions no appeal was preferred against the said order. Thus, the decision of the Larger Bench in the case of Wyeth Laboratories has attained finality.
5.  In view of the statement and having regard to the fact that in the present cases the Tribunal has not gone into the factual aspect of the assessee's case and has merely relied upon the said decision, while granting relief to the assessee, the Revenue cannot be permitted to reopen the issue.
The appeals being devoid of any merit are dismissed accordingly.
Appeals dismissed.
