In Summary Suit No.1721 of 2001 filed by Respondent No.1 herein, leave was granted to the defendants, including the appellants herein, to defend the suit on their depositing sum of Rupees thirty lakhs within a period of four weeks.

During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the parties made an agreed statement that the appellants will deposit Rupees seventy two lakhs with Prothonotary and Senior Master of the Bombay High Court within four weeks from today and, on their doing so, the decree passed in the summary suit be set aside.
