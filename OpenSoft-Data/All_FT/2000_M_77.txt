B. H. Prabhakar and Others v M.D., Karnataka State Co-Operative Apex Bank Limited
Supreme Court of India

1 February 2000
Review Petitions (C) Nos. 1676-1703 of 1999 In Cas Nos. 16699-16726 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have carefully gone through the common judgment sought to be reviewed in these petitions. In our view, no error, much less any patent error, of law could be demonstrated by the review petitioners for supporting these petitions. The resolution of 7-8-1985 was held not to be operative on the facts of the case. In the review petitions an attempt is made to show that resolution of 7-8-1985 was the basis of the appointment of the petitioners. That has not been accepted by the Court. An attempt to reargue this aspect does not fall within the scope of the review proceedings.
2.  So far as the affidavit of the Manager, Legal Cell dated 10-8-1996 is concerned it was never pressed in service before the Court when the impugned judgment was rendered. Hence, the non-consideration thereof cannot be treated to be an error apparent on the record as tried to be suggested. The policy adopted by the respondent Bank alleged to be anti-labour for which reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of Dharwad Distt. P.W.D. Literate Daily Wage Employees Assn. v. State of Karnataka 1990 Indlaw SC 7231990 Indlaw SC 7231990 Indlaw SC 723 also cannot be made the subject-matter of review proceedings as no such contention was canvassed before the Court when the impugned decision was rendered.
3.  On the other hand the petitioners were absorbed as Clerks by the respondent Bank after their temporary tenure ended on completion of an earlier project. That may be the reason why no allegation was made about anti-labour policy of the respondent Bank when the appeals were argued before the Court.
For all these reasons, the review petitions are dismissed on merits.
Petitions dismissed.
