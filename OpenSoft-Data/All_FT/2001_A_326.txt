Avtar Singh Gill v State of Punjab
Supreme Court of India

23 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.)......../2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  We are not inclined to invoke our jurisdiction under Section 438 Cr.P.C. The prayer for anticipatory bail stands rejected.
2. It would, however, be open for the petitioner to surrender before the appropriate Magistrate and then file an application for regular bail. On such application being filed, the Magistrate would try to hear and dispose it of on the same day.
3.  The refusal of the prayer for anticipatory bail would not stand on the way of the Magistrate to consider the bail application of the accused.
Order accordingly.
