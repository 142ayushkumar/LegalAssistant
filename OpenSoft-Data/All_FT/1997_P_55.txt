Collector of Central Excise, Chandigarh v Pepsi Foods Limited
Supreme Court of India

14 March 1997
C.A. No. 14618 of 1996, (Arising as an appeal from 1996 (82) E.L.T. 33 (Tribunal).)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question which arises for consideration in this appeal is whether the advertisement expenses form part of the assessable value under Section 4 of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944. We may clarify that in the present appeal we are not concerned with the royalty charges.
2. The tribunal by majority has held that the expenses incurred for advertisement were included in the assessable value and no deduction was claimed on that count and, therefore, there was no question of further including the same for the purpose of determining the excise duty. The finding is that the duty has been paid on the assessable value of the concentrate which is inclusive of the amount spent on advertisement and sale promotion and, therefore, no further duty is payable by the assessee.
3.  In the facts and circumstances of the present case, we do not see any reason to depart from this view. We are, therefore, of the opinion that there is no merit in this appeal.
4. We, therefore, dismiss the appeal but make no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
