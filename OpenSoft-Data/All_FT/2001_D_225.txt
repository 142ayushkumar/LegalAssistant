Dr. Balabhai Nanavati Hospital and N.H.M.R.C v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18368/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Since the SLP is against an interim order of the High Court refusing to grant interim relief, we are not inclined to invoke our jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution. Mr. Desai, the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, however, objects to the subsequent observations made by the High Court.
2. We are of the opinion that the High Court ought not to have made observations. In that view of the matter, we set aside that part of the observations of the High Court. Needless to mention, the order of the High Court directing no interim relief stands affirmed. The High Court would do well in disposing of the Writ Petition at an early date.
The SLP is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
