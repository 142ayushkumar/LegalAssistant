Kiran Agarwal v High Court of Himachal Pradesh and others
Supreme Court of India

10 December 2001
Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 20579/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  At no stage, prior to the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings or during the course thereof, did the petitioner address any communication to the authorities nor did she appear.
2.  We do not, therefore, consider it an appropriate case to consider the averment that the wrong rule has been applied; this could have been pointed out but was not.
3.  The High Court has, in the impugned judgment, fairly taken the view that the punishment originally imposed was disproportionate to the offence of which the petitioner had been found guilty.
4. Now, we do not see any reason to interfere, even in regard to the punishment which has subsequently been imposed. The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
