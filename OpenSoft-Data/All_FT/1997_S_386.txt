Manjoor Khan v State of Bihar and Another
Supreme Court of India

19 August 1997
Cr.A. No. 759 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 1827 of 1997)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Since the appellant has a right under the Code of Criminal Procedure to pray for bail as and when he intends to, the High Court could not have debarred him from exercising his such right for one year.
Of course, whether such prayer would be entertained or not, it is for the High Court to decide but it cannot prevent an accused from seeking his release on bail.
2. We, therefore, quash the impugned order to the above extent.
The appeal is thus allowed.
Appeal allowed.
