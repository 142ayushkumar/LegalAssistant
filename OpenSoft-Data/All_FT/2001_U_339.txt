Messrs Marut Nandan Overseas Limited v Unique International Fze.Sharjah and Others
Supreme Court of India

10  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6265/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In view of the following finding recorded by the Division Bench of the High Court, we are unable to accept the contention of Mr.Sanghi, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, that this case is one of fraud.
"In the facts of the present case as noted above, the goods had actually been assigned for shipment. Separate Bills of Lading had to be issued because the goods could not be shipped for want of space on the ship as per the earlier Bill of Lading. Prima facie it cannot be said to be a case of fraud."
2. The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
