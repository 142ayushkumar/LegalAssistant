Collector, Kaushambi v Shiv Sagar Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2627/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
Dealy condoned.
1.  There is substance in the contention raised by learned counsel for the petitioner that the High Court ought not to have interfered with the order passed by the District Collector under The U.P. Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 1986 as under Sections 15 and 16 of the said Act there is an elaborate procedure for approaching the competent authority and without approaching the competent authority respondent has filed the writ petition. He also submitted that the order passed by the District Magistrate cannot by any stretch of imagination be said to be without any jurisdiction or authority.
2.  However, considering the fact that pending hearing and disposal of petition the property was released by order dated 25th May, 2000 we do not think that any purpose would be served by interfering with the said order. It would be open to the competent authority to proceed further with the matter and decide the objections, if any, filed by the respondent, in accordance with law. Till the disposal of the matter by the competent authority, respondent shall not alienate the property in question. The petition stands disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
