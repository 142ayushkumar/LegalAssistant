Mirza Rafiullah Baig and others v Union of India and another
Supreme Court of India

2 September 2003
W.Ps. (C) No. 546 of 2000 with Nos. 60 and 132 of 2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  By these petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution, the petitioners who are citizens of India and are residing in Tonk, a parliamentary constituency, challenge the validity of the  Constitution (Seventy-ninth Amendment) Act, 1999. whereby the words "sixty years" have been substituted in place of "fifty years" in Article 334 of the Constitution. The learned counsel argues that this amendment is against the basic feature of the  Constitution.
2. According to the learned counsel democracy has been recognised as one of the essential features of the  Constitution, by this Court and since the Amendment Act deprives the democratic rights of the petitioners, in as much as it is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution,it deserves to be struck down.
3.  After we heard the matter, we are of the view that these matters are required to be heard by a Constitution Bench of five learned Judges, since it involves interpretation of the of the Constitution.
4.  The matters are, therefore, referred to a Bench of five learned Judges.
5.  Let this matter be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate orders.
Order accordingly.
