Ajit Singh and Others v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 December 1999
Review Petition (Civil) 1504-1506 I.A. Nos. 1-3 of 1997.
The Order of the Court was as follows :
IN Civil Appeal Nos. 3792-3794 of 1989.
The following Order of the Court was delivered :
Delay condoned.
1. We are of the view that there are no merits in the review applications.
2. In Ajit Singh II v. State of Punjab, [1997] 7 SCC 209, it was stated that, relying upon earlier judgments starting from 1963, that Art. 16(4) was only an enabling provision and did not impose any constitutional duty nor confer any fundamental right for reservations. The observations by Jeevan Reddy, J. in Indira Sawhney relied upon in the review applications do not deal with the above issue. It was the view of two Constitution Bench Judgments of this Court, one of 1963 in M.R. Balaji v. State of Mysore, [1963] Supp. 1 SCR 439 1962 Indlaw SC 272 and another in 1968 in C.A. Rajendran v. Union of India, [1968] 1 SCR 721 1967 Indlaw SC 385 and also two three judgments of this Court in Pand T Scheduled Caste/Tribe Employees Welfare Association (Regd.) v. Union of India, [1998] 4 SCC 147 and State Bank of India v. Scheduled Caste/ Tribes Employees Welfare Association, [1996] 4 SCC 1191 1996 Indlaw SC 2845, that Art. 16 (4) was only an enabling provision. The view was nowhere dissented in Indira Sawhney by Jeevan Reddy, J.
3. It appears to us that all the nine Judges in Indira Sawhney were of the same view that Art. 16(4) was not in the nature of a fundamental right and was only an enabling provision. In this connection, reference may be made with advantage to the view of the Jeevan Reddy, J.  referring to Subba Rao, J, that Art. 16 (4) was a provision conferring a 'power' and referring to Art. 16 (1) alone as a guarantee and not to Art. 16 (4); to the view of Sawant, J. , Pandian J. . Thommen, J. , Sahai, J.  with whom Kuldip Singh, J. agreed, - all expressly stating that Art. 16 (4) was only an enabling provision. Thus, majority of the learned Judges expressly stated that Art. 16 (4) was an "enabling provision". Merely because the reservation for backward classes was created as reasonable classification and justified, that does not detract from the view that Art. 16 (4) was only an enabling provision.
4. For the aforesaid reasons, we find there is no merit in these review petitions which are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
