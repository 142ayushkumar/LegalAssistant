Uttar Pradesh Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v Rajendra Kumar Agarwal and others
Supreme Court of India

21 April 2008
IA No. 2 of 2008 in C.A. No. 1604 of 2008
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  This is an application for modification of our order dated 22-2-2008 In the application for modification, it has been alleged by the appellant that there was no occasion for this Court to decide the constitutional validity of Rule 8(A) of the U.P. Government Servants Seniority (Third Amendment) Rules, 2007 in M. Nagaraj v. Union of India 2006 Indlaw SC 722 It has been further alleged that the writ petitioners had never challenged the constitutional validity of Art. 16(4-A) of the Constitution of India in their writ petition.
2.  We have heard Mr U.U. Lalit, learned Senior Counsel for the applicant Respondents 1, 2, 5 and 7 and Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant. In our order dated 22-2-2008 we have made the following observations in the same which runs as under:
"Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the decision of this Court in M. Nagaraj v. Union of India 2006 Indlaw SC 722 in which the constitutional validity of the provisions of Art. 16(4-A) of the Constitution of India and Rule 8(A) of the U.P. Government Servants Seniority (Third Amendment) Rules, 2007 has already been upheld, we are unable to agree with Mr P.P. Rao that at the interim stage, there was any occasion for the High Court to grant the interim order in this pending writ application."
3.  It appears that there has been a mistake on our part when we said that the constitutional validity of the provisions of Rule 8(A) of the U.P. Government Servants Seniority (Third Amendment) Rules, 2007 has already been upheld in M. Nagaraj v. Union of India 2006 Indlaw SC 722. Considering this aspect of the matter, we direct that the sentence viz. "and Rule 8(A) of the U.P. Government Servants Seniority (Third Amendment) Rules, 2007" be deleted and the paragraph which has been noted hereinabove may be replaced with the following paragraph:
"Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the decision of this Court in M. Nagaraj v. Union of India 2006 Indlaw SC 722 in which the constitutional validity of the provisions of Art. 16(4-A) of the Constitution of India has already been upheld, we are unable to agree with Mr P.P. Rao, that at the interim stage there was any occasion for the High Court to grant interim order in this pending writ application."
4.  The words "Mr Trivedi" shall also be replaced by "Mr Rakesh Dwivedi".
5.  Accordingly the order dated 22-2-2008 is modified. IA No. 2 of 2008 is thus disposed of.
The Registry is directed to issue necessary corrigendum.
Application disposed of
