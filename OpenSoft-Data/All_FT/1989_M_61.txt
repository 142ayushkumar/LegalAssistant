Messrs Textile Supply Company and Another v Income Tax Officer and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 January 1989
C.A. No. 1178 of 1975
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court declined to interfere on the writ petition presented by the appellants on the ground that assessment proceedings were pending in the matter and it was open to the appellants to participate in those assessment proceedings and to take all valid objections therein.
2.  The view taken by the High Court seems to be plainly correct. We may point out, however, that the High Court has referred to the proceeding as one pending under Section 27 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922.
Order accordingly.
