Appropriate Authority, Ahmedabad, and Another v Hindumal Balmukand Investment Company P. Limited
Supreme Court of India

19 July 2001
C.A. No. 3116 of 1997 (Arising as an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 19 September 1995, of the Gujarat High Court in S.C.A. No. 5328 of 1995).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The entire basis of the order that has been made by the Appropriate Authority is the calculation of the FSI of the property under consideration as compared to that of the sale instance property, but there is not a word in the order as to what that FSI was and how it has been calculated.
2. A speaking order must speak for itself and a reference to the show-cause notice is uncalled for.
The civil appeal is dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
