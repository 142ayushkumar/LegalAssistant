Motia Devi and Others v Municipal Corporation, Faridabad
Supreme Court of India

31 March 2004
C.A. No. 7893/2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  One Shri K. L. Gulati, the husband of Appellant 1, was an employee of the Faridabad Notified Area Committee. Subsequently, the Faridabad Notified Area Committee was renamed as "Faridabad Complex Administration" (for short "the Administration"). The Administration has since been renamed as "the Municipal Corporation". On October 31, 1984, Shri K. L. Gulati retired from the service and on June 3, 1992, he died. It is not disputed that on retirement, Shri K. L. Gulati opted for provident fund, which scheme was applicable to the employees of the Administration. The State of Haryana, by a notification dated March 5, 1993, provided for Pension Scheme to the employees of the Municipal Corporation. The Scheme provided that it shall come into force with effect from April 16, 1992.
2.   The appellants herein, who are the wife and children of Shri K. L. Gulati, filed a suit for mandatory injunction for the grant of pensionary benefits to them. The Trial Court decreed the suit and the appeal preferred against the said judgment before the first Appellate Court was dismissed. Aggrieved, the defendant-respondent preferred a second appeal before the High Court, which was allowed and the suit was dismissed. It is against the said judgment, the plaintiff-appellants are in appeal before us.
3.  Learned counsel urged that the High Court fell in error in holding that the notification dated April 15, 1992 was not applicable to the employees, who retired prior to April 16, 1992. We do not find any merit in the arguments. The scheme itself provided that it shall come into force with effect from April 16, 1992 and will apply to those who were appointed on or before April 16, 1992 on full-time regular basis or were working immediately before April 16, 1992 and opted for those Rules. It is not disputed that Shri K. L. Gulati had already retired in 1984 and was not working on the relevant date i.e. April 16, 1992. Under such circumstances, we are in agreement with the view taken by the High Court.
4.  It was then urged that in any case by virtue of the notification dated January 13, 1975, the appellants were entitled to pensionary benefits. We also do not find any merit in this argument. Note 1 of Rule 3.16 of the Punjab Civil Services Rules excluded the application of Pension Schemes to the employees of the Municipalities.
5.  For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any merit in this appeal. It fails and is, accordingly, dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
