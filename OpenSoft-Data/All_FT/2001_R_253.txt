New India Assurance Company Limited v Ranjit Singha and Anr
Supreme Court of India

12 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...../2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that there was actually no policy of insurance issued by the petitioner (M/s. New India Assurance Company Ltd.) in favour of respondent No.2. But this fact is not averred in the written statement filed by the Assurance Company before the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner. Learned counsel submits that at the time when the written statement was prepared this fact was not known to the Assurance Company and that it reached the notice subsequently.
2. Even so, the Assurance Company did not care to examine any one for stating that fact before the Commissioner. It is too late in the day for the Assurance Company now to say that no policy had been issued in favour of respondent no.2. The highly negligent manner in which the claim was resisted by the Assurance Company before the Commissioner is not a ground for this Court to interfere to salvage the interest of the Assurance Company. The SLPs are dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
