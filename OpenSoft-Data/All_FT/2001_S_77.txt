Sambalpur University and Another v Sagarika Mishra and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7284/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the High Court was ill-advised to have initiated contempt proceedings on the facts of the present case.
2. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed and the contempt proceedings initiated are set aside. The High Court should now decide the writ petition filed by the respondent which is pending before it. Preferably the decision should be given within six months.
Appeal allowed.
