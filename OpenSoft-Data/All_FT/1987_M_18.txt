Supreme Court of India

7  May  1987
Civil Appeal No. 384 of 1977
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Shri A. K. Ganguli, Learned Counsel for the Union of India submits that Article 311 of the Constitution is applicable to the Staff Artists of the All India Radio. We are of the view that the statement made on behalf of the Government represents the true legal position because the Staff Artists are holding civil posts under the Government.
In view of the above statement, this appeal filed against the judgment of the High Court of Allahabad in Special Appeal No. 258 of 1974 which has also taken the view that article 311 is applicable to those Staff Artists has to be dismissed. This appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed
