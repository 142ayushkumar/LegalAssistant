The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel on both sides.
1.  The High Court dismissed the Letters Patent Appeal(LPA) on the ground that the same had been filed not in due time but 129 days thereafter.
2. The explanation sought to be offered by the appellants is that there was communication gap between the appellants and their counsel on account of the illness of the party who was handling the case.
3.  In the circumstances the High Court ought to have condoned the delay. Therefore, the order made by the High Court is set aside; remitting the matter to the High Court and the LPA is restored to the file of the High Court for decision on merits.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
