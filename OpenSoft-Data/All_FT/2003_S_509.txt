Mathai Paulose and Others v State of Kerala and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2003
C.A. Nos.4765-4766 Of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals are against the judgment of the High Court dated 19th Mach, 1996. Land of the appellants was acquired and possession was taken from 19th March, 1980. The only dispute is regarding valuation of nutmeg trees which were standing on the land. Between parties it is agreed that on the land in L.A.R. 266 of 1983 there were two nutmeg trees and in L.A.R. 277 of 1983 there were 27 nutmeg trees. The Land Acquisition Officer fixed the price of trees at Rs.3,680.95 per tree. The Reference Court fixed the price at Rs.6,320/- per tree. The High Court in the impugned judgment observes that there is no evidence on record regarding quality of the nutmeg tree or the market rate at which nutmeg was being sold at the relevant time. The High Court also holds that a Circular dated 24th May, 1977, relied upon by the claimants, had not been proved.
2. The High Court observes that it has not been able to understand how the Reference Court arrived at a figure of Rs.6,320/- per tree. The High Court then decides to grant an ad hoc increase of Rs.1,000/- per tree to the claimants and awards Rs.7,320/- per tree.
3.  We have been shown the judgment dated 30th September, 1986 of the Reference Court. Having read the judgment, we are also at a loss as to how the sum of Rs.6,320/- per tree has been arrived at by the Reference Court. Before us neither side could explain how this figure was arrived at. Beforeus there is no material to show what was the yield of fruits on the trees or what the market price was on the relevant date. We do not approve of the High Court increasing the price by Rs.1, 000/- on an ad-hoc basis. However, the State filed no appeal.
Thus, we do not disturb what is awarded by the High Court. At the same time there is no material before us on basis of which we can accept appellants' plea to enhance the compensation. We feel that this is not a fit case for interference. Accordingly, the appeals stand dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
