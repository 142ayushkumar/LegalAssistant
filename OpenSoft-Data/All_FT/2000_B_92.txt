Supreme Court of India

14 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9925/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Shri Harish Salve, learned Solicitor General made a frontal attack on the impugned order on the ground that the contempt jurisdiction cannot be stretched to the extent of deciding the title or possession of the immovable properties.
2.  Shri K. Parasaran, learned senior counsel submitted that the impugned order was not intended for deciding the title of the contesting parties it was only within the parameters of the contempt jurisdiction.
3.  We refrain from expressing any opinion on the rival contentions, for, present is only an interlocutory order. We dispose of this matter without prejudice to the right of either of the parties to approach this Court on culmination of the proceedings initiated before the High Court.
4. We also make it clear that if the High Court finally passes an order against the petitioner the same will remain in abeyance for a period of 6 weeks therefrom for enabling the petitioner to approach this court with special leave petition.
Special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
