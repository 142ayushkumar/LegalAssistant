T. Jayaraman v State of Tamil Nadu
Supreme Court of India

6  May  2009
Criminal Appeal No. 1047 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  The appellant in this appeal was convicted by the trial court under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, [for short, 'the Act'] and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay fine of rupees five hundred; in default, to undergo further imprisonment for a period of three months. He was also convicted under Section 13(1)(d) read with Section 13(2) of the Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year and to pay fine of rupees five hundred; in default, to undergo further imprisonment for a period of three months. The appellant was then convicted under Section 12 of the Act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay fine of rupees five hundred; in default to undergo further imprisonment for a period of three months. All the sentences, however, were ordered to run concurrently. The appeal preferred by the appellant was dismissed by the High Court. Hence, this appeal by special leave.
2.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. The trial court convicted the appellant upon threadbare evaluation of evidence. The High Court independently scrutinized the evidence and expressed its unequivocal agreement with the trial court. The findings recorded by the trial court and High Court do not suffer from any perversity warranting interference by this Court.
The appeal, accordingly, fails and the same is dismissed.
3.  The bail bonds of the appellant, who is on bail, are cancelled and is directed to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of sentence.
Appeal dismissed
