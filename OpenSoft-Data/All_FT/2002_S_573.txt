State of Haryana v State of Punjab and another
Supreme Court of India

5 March 2002
Review Petition (C) No. 175 of 2002 in Original Suit No. 6 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have carefully gone through the review petition and the connected papers therewith and we do not find any merit therein. The so-called vital question with regard to interpretation of Article 131 and Article 262 has been answered in the Constitution Bench decision and we are bound by the same. Non-providing an appeal would not confer a right of hearing of the review in open court and on examining the questions raised, we see no justification for hearing in open court. The prayer for deletion of some observations is misconceived.
The review petition is accordingly dismissed.
Review dismissed.
