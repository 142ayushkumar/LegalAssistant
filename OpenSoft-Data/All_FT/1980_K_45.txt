Kundlik v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

2 February 1980
Cr.A. No. 189 of 1974.
The Judgment was delivered by: CHINNAPPA REDDY, J.
1.  We have been taken through the Judgment of the trial Court by Mr. Dhebar, counsel for the respondent State. Mr. Santokh Singh, counsel for the appellant has not appeared. There was no previous enmity between the parties. The false implication of the appellant was therefore out of question. We find no good ground to interfere with the order of the High Court. The appeal fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
