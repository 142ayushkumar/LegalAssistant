State of Punjab and Others v Balwinder Kaur and Others
Supreme Court of India

8  May  2008
Civil Appeal No. 7974 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  The order appealed against was passed by the High Court in Regular Second Appeal. The High Court disposed of the Regular Second Appeal in terms of the following order:
"At the request of counsel for the appellant and respondent in person, instead of stay application, appeal itself is taken on board for final disposal.
No merit. Dismissed."
2.  The order is cryptic, lacks reasons. We, accordingly, set aside the impugned order and remand the matter to the High Court to dispose of the appeal in accordance with law. The appeal is restored to the file of the High Court. Since the appeal is pending for quite sometime, the High Court is requested to dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as possible.
Appeal is allowed.
