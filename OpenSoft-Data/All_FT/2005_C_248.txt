M/s. Birla Corporation Limited v Commissioner of Central Excise
Supreme Court of India

26 July 2005
Appeal (civil) 5118 of 2003
The Judgment was delivered by : B. P. Singh, J.
1.  The short question involved in this appeal is whether the duty paid on spares of ropeway used for the purpose of transporting the crushed limestone from the mines located 4.2 kms. a way to the factory, is entitled to Modvat credit.
2.  The Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (for short 'CEGAT') by its impugned order of 25th March, 2003 disallowed the Modvat credit on the ground that the ropeway transports raw material from the mines to the factory premises and is not a material handling equipment within the factory premises. It is not disputed before us that the crushed lime stone is brought from the mines to the factory premises where it is deposited utilising the ropeway as a means of transportation.
3.  An identical issue came up for consideration before the CEGAT, in J. K. Udaipur Udyog Ltd. Vs. CCE, Jaipur-II [2001(130) ELT 996 2002 Indlaw CEGAT 1519. In that case the tribunal held, following the principles laid down in the case of CCE, Chennai Vs. Pepsico India Holdings Ltd. [2001(130) ELT 193 2000 Indlaw CEGAT 2065], t hat the assessee was entitled to the Modvat credit. The Commissioner of Central Excise came up in appeal before this Court in Civil Appeal No.1129/2003 impugning the aforesaid decision of the CEGA T. However, by order dated July 10, 2003 the appeal was dismissed in view of the fact that the learned Attorney General appearing for the Commissioner of Central Excise stated that he did not wish to press the appeal in view of the letter of the Department dated 5th June, 2003. The aforesaid letter reads as follows:
"Please refer to your office letter, dated 2nd May 03 on the above cited subject. In this connection it is to inform you that case of CCE, Chennai Vs. M/s.Peps.co India Holdings Ltd. Reported in 2001(42) RLT 800 2000 Indlaw CEGAT 2065, Final order No.1581/2000 dated 27.10.2000 in appeal No. E/2603/1998/MAS has been accepted as reported by Chief Commissioner Central Excise Chennai vide his letter C. No. IV/16/16/2003-CZO dated 3-6-03."
In these circumstances, this Court dismissed the appeal.
4.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted before us that there are several decisions of the tribunal which have followed the principles laid down in J. K. Udaipur Udyog Ltd. and Pepsico India Holdings Ltd 2000 Indlaw CEGAT 2065. (supra) and the law is now well settled.
5.  In the instant case the same question arises for consideration and the facts are almost identical. We cannot permit the Revenue to take a different stand in this case. The earlier appeal involving identical issue was not pressed and was therefore, dismissed. The respondent having taken a conscious decision to accept the principles laid down in Pepsico India Holdings Ltd 2000 Indlaw CEGAT 2065.(supra) cannot be permitted to take the opposite stand in this case. If we were to permit them to do so, the law will be in a state of confusion and will place the authorities as well as the assessees in a quandary ell ant.
6.  We, therefore, allow this appeal and hold that Modvat credit is available to the app in the facts and circumstances of the case. This appeal is accordingly allowed. The order of the CEGAT is set aside.
No costs.
