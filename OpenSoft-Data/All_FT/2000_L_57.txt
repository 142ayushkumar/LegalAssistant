National Aluminium Company Limited v Lyong Heung Trading Company Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 January 2000
Arbitration Petitions (C) Nos. 18, 19 and 22 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  IAs for substituted service are taken on record. In view of what is stated therein and in view of the fact that various attempts were made by the petitioner earlier to get the respondents served by following regular process and as all steps have failed and even efforts made to serve the respondents through High Commissions at London and Hong Kong have failed, there is no escape from the conclusion that the respondents are now required to be served by substituted service.
2. The petitioner is therefore, permitted to serve the respondents by issuing public notice once in a newspaper having circulation in London, so far as IAs in Arbitration Petitions Nos. 19 and 22 of 1999 are concerned while in IA in Arbitration Petition No. 18, publication of the notice is directed to be effected once in a newspaper having circulation in Macao and once in a newspaper having circulation in Hong Kong. The requisite affidavits having carried out this direction will be filed by the petitioner with copies of the relevant newspaper notices. For that purpose, adjourned to 30-3-2000. Notices to be published shall mention the returnable date i.e. 30-3-2000 at 1.30 p.m. in chambers. IAs are allowed accordingly.
Applications allowed.
