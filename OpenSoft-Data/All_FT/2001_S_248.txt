Sharda Sahay v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13135/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The notice was issued limited to the question whether the High Court was justified in dismissing Letters Patent Appeal on the ground of delay. No doubt the High Court has further added one line `dismissed on merits also'. After perusing the record and after hearing learned counsel for the parties and on the facts and circumstances of the case, we feel it appropriate to set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remand the case back for its fresh consideration condoning the delay in filing the Letters Patent Appeal. This is done on the condition that the appellant to deposits the admitted rent plus 15% interest on it deposited within a period of six weeks from today in the High Court itself.
With this observation this appeal is finally disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
