Kulwinder Singh Laddi v State of Punjab and Another
Supreme Court of India

4 November 2004
Cr.A. No. 405 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard the parties.
1. The sole appellant was convicted by the trial court u/s. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay fine of Rs. 5000, in default, to undergo further imprisonment for a period of two months. On appeal being preferred, the Sessions Court upheld the conviction. Thereafter, the appellant moved the High Court in revision which refused to interfere with the conviction of the appellant. Hence this appeal by special leave.
2. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant pressed this appeal only on the question of sentence and submitted that as the appellant has remained in custody for a period of more than two-and-a-half months, the sentence of imprisonment awarded against him may be reduced to the period already undergone. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that ends of justice would be met in case the sentence of imprisonment awarded against the appellant is reduced to the period already undergone.
3. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part and while upholding conviction of the appellant, the sentence of imprisonment awarded against him is reduced to the period already undergone. The appellant who is on bail is discharged from the liability of bail bonds.
