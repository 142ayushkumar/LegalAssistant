1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the impugned order passed by the High Court of judicature at Patna, we are of the view that the High Court has not passed a speaking order. That being the position, we set aside the impunged order and request the High Court to dispose of the application of the appellant in accordance with law within a period of three months from the date of supply of a copy of this order to it, without granting unnecessary adjournment to either of the parties. Till such disposal of the application by the High Court, interim order dated 5th December, 2008 of this Court directing that the petitioner shall not be arrested will continue.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of
