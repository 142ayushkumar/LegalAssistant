B. Sansarkan and Others v State of Kerala and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 August 1987
W.Ps. (Civil) Nos. 353, 112 and 935 of 1987 with 410, 1574 and 1790 of 1986 and 874 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for both the parties we feel that the appropriate order to be passed in this cases should be in the same terms as in P. K. Narayan v. State of Kerala 1983 Indlaw SC 3051983 Indlaw SC 305. The State Government is directed to take steps as early as possible to ascertain the number of vacancies that will have to be filled up by resorting to recruitment through Punjab Service Commission. Immediately after such ascertainment the State Government shall write to the Public Service Commission to hold an examination to select candidates to fill up the vacancies.
2.   Until a selected candidate is able to join the post to which he is selected the ad hoc employee who is now working in any post shall continue in that post. This order does not confer any other type of right on the ad hoc employees. We hope that the entire process of selection and appointment of fresh candidates will be completed within six months from today
3.  If there are any candidates who are already selected by the Punjab Service Commission and who not yet "advised to join" they may be issued such advices and on those candidates reporting for duty the ad hoc employees working in those posts shall vacate the posts. All the petitions are accordingly disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
