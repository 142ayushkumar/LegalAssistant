CIVIL APPEAL NO.2750 OF 1997
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  In a proceeding arising under the Industrial Disputes Act before the Industrial Tribunal Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were represented by the Government Pleader and an advocate while the appellant was represented by its President. A contention was put forth before the Tribunal that the respondent Nos.1 and 2 should not be represented by advocates.
2.  The Tribunal was of the view that the President of the appellant is a qualified advocate and there was no impediment in allowing respondent Nos. 1 and 2 being represented by advocates. That view of the Tribunal was affirmed by the High Court in a Writ Petition and, thereafter, in a Writ appeal. We find no substance in this appeal and the same is dismissed accordingly.
Appeal dismissed.
