D. P. F. Textiles Limited v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

12 September 1996
C.A. No. 1742 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal appears to be covered by the decision of this Court in Kasinka Trading and Anr. v. Union of India and Anr., reported in 1994 Indlaw SC 21831994 Indlaw SC 2183.
2.  It is true that the judgment under appeal does not expressly refer to the public interest which moved the respondents to curtail the period of an Exemption Notification but, in the circumstances, it must be assumed that such public interest existed. No other view can now be taken in a matter which relates back to the year 1983. The appeal is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
