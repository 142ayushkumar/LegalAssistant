Supreme Court of India

17 December 2009
INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATION NO.2 OF 2009 IN CIVIL APPEAL NO.6753 OF 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Heard Mr. M.L. Verma, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent-applicant and Mr. S.K. Bagaria, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant - non- applicant. We are satisfied that two typographical errors have crept in the judgment of this Court passed on November 25, 2008 in Civil Appeal No.6753 of 2008 and proceed to correct those mistakes.
2.  In paragraph 6 of the judgment, before the sentence "In furtherance of the award and for its implementation....." the words "According to the appellant" is to be added and read.
3.  In paragraph 13 of the judgment, there is a mistake of date and in place of "June 24, 2006", "June 24, 1996" is to be read.
This disposes of Interlocutory Application No.2 of 2009.
The Registry is directed to issue necessary corrigendum.
Appeal disposed of
