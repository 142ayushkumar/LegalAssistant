These seven applicants claim to be squatters in Shahdara (South) Zone.
5.  According to learned counsel for the respondent MCD verification process in this zone is over and due intimation according to him, is already sent to Petitioner 2, Mohd. Kasim whose claim according to him, is rejected. If verification of this zone is complete, the right of the applicants whose applications are rejected will arise for approaching the Chopra Committee.
6.  According to learned counsel for the petitioners, no reasoned order or any order rejecting his claim is received by Petitioner 2. According to learned counsel for the respondent MCD rest of the petitioners have not applied for reverification. Learned counsel for the petitioners will verify in connection with this submission of learned counsel for the respondent.
7.  So far as Petitioner 2 is concerned, further details will be made available by learned counsel for the respondent MCD on the next date of hearing. Learned counsel for the respondent MCD will also cross-check regarding the applicants who have produced copies of the intimation with endorsements and serial numbers said to have been given by the officers of the respondent Corporation. These IAs will therefore stand adjourned to 11-9-1998 at 2.00 p.m.
IAs Nos. 266-67 in WP (C) No. 1699 of 1987.
8.  Learned counsel for the petitioners states, on the basis of the documents filed in these IAs that all the 14 applicants had already lodged their claims earlier on 27-7-1992 and again for reverification on 24-7-1997 pursuant to our order dated 1-5-1997, Gainda Ram v. MCD1997 Indlaw SC 1759. This statement is also made on affidavit in these IAs. Learned counsel for MCD shall cross-check the documents produced along with these IAs and will file counter in connection with each one of the applicants and will also produce relevant contemporaneous records showing the receipt of the applications from the applicants concerned.
9.  The records pertaining to the receipt of applications in July 1992 and July 1997 shall be produced on the next date of hearing along with the affidavit. To be listed on 11-9-1998 at 2.00 p.m.
10. IA No. 268 in IAs Nos. 247-48 in WP (C) No. 1699 of 1987.
11.  These six applicants who are clearly covered by our order dated 1-5- 1997 cannot be disturbed from their present occupation at Pushpa Market, Opposite J Block, Behind Juneja Handloom, Lajpat Nagar, New Delhi.
12.  The stand taken by the respondent MCD in its affidavit-in-reply is totally misconceived as the reliance placed on the order of the Lt. Governor dated 13-11-1996 cannot survive in view of our later order dated 1-5-1997 which protects them and provides that who might have been dispossessed from their respective places pursuant to the Lt. Governor's order should be put back in possession.
13.  So long as the direction contained in the order dated 1-5-1997, Gainda Ram v. MCD, 1997 Indlaw SC 1759 is not modified in appropriate proceedings, the said direction must be obeyed.
14. It is therefore directed that all these six applicants shall not be disturbed from their present respective places as directed earlier. Whatever goods might have been removed by the authorities in the meantime shall be restored to the applicants concerned. It will also be open to the petitioners to file appropriate proceedings before the competent court for recovery of damages if any.
15.  So far as Prayer (ii) is concerned, we reiterate that the respondent MCD will complete the verification as per our order dated 1-5-1997, Gainda Ram v. MCD1997 Indlaw SC 1759 in connection with these applicants. IA stands disposed of accordingly.
CP (C) No. 322 of 1998.
Contempt petition is disposed of in terms of the signed order.
IA No. 269 in WP (C) No. 1699 of 1987.
16.  The prayers made in this IA by Janta Hawkers Welfare Association cannot be granted at this stage. So far as Prayer (a) is concerned, the interim orders passed from time to time will have to be complied with by all concerned.
17.  So far as other prayers are concerned, it is not the stage at which any member of the petitioner association can feel aggrieved. As and when the appropriate stage is reached and when their grievance is not considered, the individual member may move for appropriate orders. In view of this observation and clarification, the IA is disposed of.
IA No. 271 in WP (C) No. 1699 of 1987.
18.  Two weeks' time is granted to the learned counsel for the respondent MCD to file its response to this IA.
