Commnr. of Income Tax, Bombay v Messrs S.V.Shah Constrn.Services Pvt.Ltd
Supreme Court of India

28 November 2000
C.A. No.411/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court at Bombay declined to call for a reference of the following question:
"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the assessee which was engaged as a sub-contractor for execution of work outside India is entitled to weighted deduction under Section 35B(1)(iii), (vii) and (viii) of the Income Tax Act ?"
2.  The Revenue is in appeal by special leave thereagainst. The High Court declined to call for a reference on the ground that the question stood concluded by its earlier judgment in Associated Cement vs. C.I.T. It appears that the Revenue had not filed a petition for special leave to appeal thereagainst because the amount involved was very small.
3.  However, it appears clear from a reading of the order of the Tribunal, arising out of which the question was posed, that it raises issues of fact, not law. We, therefore, decline to call for a reference thereof and dismiss the appeal.
No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
