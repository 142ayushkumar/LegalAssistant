1.  We have heard Mr. Gaur. Mr. Gaur submits that Appellant/Plaintiff was present in Court and ready to give evidence but was not permitted to do so. Mr. Gaur states that if given one more opportunity the Appellant will, on the date/s fixed for hearing by the trial Court, keep himself and all his witnesses available in Court and will lead their evidence without fail. Mr. Gaur states that the Appellant will not ask for adjournment on any ground whatsoever.
