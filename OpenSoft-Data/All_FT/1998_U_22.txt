Umesh Shivappa Ambi and Others v Angadi Shekara Basappa and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 March 1998
C.A. No. 1572 of 1998 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 21938 of 1997)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Election for 11 Directors of Respondent 3 Cooperative Bank (Society) for the years 1997-98 to 1999-2000 was conducted. The election results were declared on 23-9-1997. Since there was no contest, the appellants who were the candidates, were declared elected. The first respondent had also filed his nomination paper which was earlier rejected. Thereafter, the first respondent filed a writ petition before the Karnataka High Court challenging the rejection of his nomination paper.
2.  The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition holding that the proper remedy for the first respondent was to file an election petition u/s. 70 of the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act, 1959.
In appeal, however, the Division Bench has set aside the order of the learned Single Judge and has held that the nomination of the first respondent was wrongly rejected. It has further directed that a fresh calendar of events be published for holding an election to the posts of 11 Directors of the respondent Cooperative Society.
3.  It is now well settled that once an election is over, the aggrieved candidate will have to pursue his remedy in accordance with the provisions of law and this (High) Court will not ordinarily interfere with the elections u/art. 226 of the Constitution. in K. K. Shrivastava v. Bhupendra Kumar Jain  1977 Indlaw SC 3471977 Indlaw SC 347. The Court will not ordinarily interfere where there is an appropriate or equally efficacious remedy available, particularly in relation to election disputes.
4. In the present case, u/s. 70(2)(C) of the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act, 1959 any dispute arising in connection with the election of a President, Vice-President, Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer or member of Committee of the Society has to be referred to the Registrar by raising a dispute before him. The Registrar is required to decide this in accordance with law.
5.  This was, therefore, not a fit case for intervention u/art. 226. Hence, the impugned judgment is set aside and the order of the learned Single Judge is restored. The period of 6 months prescribed in the order of the learned Single Judge for the decision of the Registrar will run from the date of the raising of the dispute before him.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
