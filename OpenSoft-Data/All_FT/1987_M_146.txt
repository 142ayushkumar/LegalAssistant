Ms. Sone Aggarwal (Minor) Through R. C. Aggarwal v University of Delhi and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 July 1987
W.P. (Civil) No. 1054 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Heard Mr. Bana for the petitioner and Mr. Rao for the Delhi University. The petitioner had applied for admission to the MBBS course of the Delhi University for the session 1986-87 and we are told that having been unsuccessful to obtain admission here, the petitioner has got admission in MBBS course at Varanasi. The point raised in this petition is that the principle laid down by this court in Dr. Pradeep Jain v. Union of India, 1984 Indlaw SC 721984 Indlaw SC 72 has not been implemented either for the previous year to which the dispute relates nor even this year. Mr. Bana contends that the basis on which the Delhi University held the selection examination for 30 per cent for 15 per cent seats in either year was wrong inasmuch the students belonging to the Delhi region were also permitted to compete for the 30 per cent seats.
2. We find nothing irregular in the Delhi University's interpretation of our judgment and therefore, the selection made by the Delhi University in regard to 30 per cent seats is not vitiated. The petitioner will not succeed on this ground.
3. Mr. Bana next pleaded that the petitioner having been admitted to MBBS course in Banaras Hindu University may be permitted to seek transfer to a medical college under Delhi University on the ground that the petitioner's parents live in Delhi. Such transfer is regulated by a set of rules of the University. Mr. Rao, appearing for Delhi University has agreed that in case the petitioner makes an application in accordance with the rules and complies with the procedure her case would be considered appropriately. The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
