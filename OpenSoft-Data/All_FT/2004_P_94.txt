Pramod Kumar Jain v Sudha Choubey and Others
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2004
C.As. Nos. 7318-19 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We find that from the initial stage Dr. Vinod Chand Choubey having entered into sub-tenancy has been taken note of. In fact from the order of the Rent Controlling Authority, Jabalpur dated 18-8-1999 it is clear that there was no dispute before the said authority that the disputed premises were given by the Receiver to Vinod Chand Choubey on rent, and it was given to the appellant on sub-tenancy.
2. The High Court has rightly come to the conclusion that once the tenant has been directed to be evicted the consequences automatically follow so far as the appellant is concerned. We find no infirmity in the order of the High Court. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
