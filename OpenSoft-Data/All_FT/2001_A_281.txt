Ashwini Suresh Saini and Others v State of Maharashtra and Anr
Supreme Court of India

14 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil).....CC 5626-5633/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The grievance of Mr. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners is that the impugned order could not have been passed on his application by which the benefits conferred by the Tribunal could have been taken away. We find from records that the State Government also assailed the said order of the Tribunal.
2. Though the order, on the face of it, does not indicate that that application also stood disposed of, but we assume that the State's application has also been considered on the date when the impugned order was passed.
3.  Our assumption is justified because of the order dated 15.02.2000 on Review Applications.
4.  Mr. Deshpande, learned counsel appearing for the State would file an affidavit indicating whether the State's Writ Petition against the order of the Tribunal stood disposed of by the impugned order or not, within four weeks from today.
Put up this matter after four weeks.
Order accordingly.
