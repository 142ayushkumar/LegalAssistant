Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay v Messrs Tiecicon Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

3 September 1987
C.As. Nos. 658-60 of 1975
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Income Tax Appellant Tribunal held in appeals filed by the respondent-assessee relating to the assessment years 1968-69, 1969-70, 1970-71 that inasmuch as the respondent supplied cool, filtered and chilled air through air-conditioning apparatus to the lessees in the building under consideration, it was an "industrial company" within the meaning of Section 2(6)(d) of the Finance Act, 1968 and Section 2(6)(c) of the Finance Act, 1969 and 1970, as it could be said to have engaged in the manufacture or processing of goods and therefore, the rate of tax applicable to the respondent was 55 per cent and not the rate of 65 per cent.
2.   The application made by the Commissioner of Tax for reference of the question whether the respondent was an "industrial company" in terms of the definitions referred to earlier was rejected by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal on the ground that the question was one of fact and not of law. A reference application made by the Commissioner of Income Tax to the High Court was rejected on the same ground. In these appeals against the order of the High Court declining to call for a statement of the case and rejecting the reference application, we have heard learned counsel for the parties and we are satisfied that the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the High Court are right in holding that the question is one of fact. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals but without any order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
