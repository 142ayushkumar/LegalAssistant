"There shall be stay of operation of the impugned order for a period of two months from this date on condition that the petitioners shall deposit half of the amount awarded by the High Court in the Reference Court within one month from this date".

3.  Before us, Ms. Kiran Suri, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted on instructions that in compliance with the aforesaid order of this Court, 50% of the amount awarded by the High Court in the Reference case has already been deposited. Such being the position and considering the total amount of compensation payable on the basis of the order of the High Court, we dispose of these applications for release of pre-deposit amount on the following terms and conditions:-
a) There shall be stay of operation of the impugned order till the disposal of the petitions or until further orders of this Court.
b) The claimants are entitled to withdraw 50% of the amount already deposited by the petitioner in compliance with our interim order passed on 29th of September, 2008 without furnishing any security and the balance 50% of the amount deposited in compliance with our order can be withdrawn by the claimants/respondents after furnishing security to the satisfaction of the Reference Court, Gulbarga where the money has already been deposited.
c) Hearing of these Special Leave Petitions be expedited.
4.  Let the Special Leave Petitions be listed for hearing on any Non-Miscellaneous day in the month of March, 2009. These applications are thus disposed of.
5.  We, however, make it clear that in the event it is found that the amount deposited by the petitioner in compliance with our order dated 29th of September, 2008 is not the amount awarded by the High Court, in that case, it will be open to the claimants/respondents to apply for vacating this interim order.
