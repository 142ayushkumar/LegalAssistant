State of Madhya Pradesh v M.R.Construction Engers.And Contratr
Supreme Court of India

29 April 2008
Civil Appeal No.3194 of 2008 (Arising out of SLP(C)No.3916 of 2007)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
While issuing notice on 19.02.2007, we passed the following Order :-
"Issue notice, returnable within four weeks, on the question of condonation of delay and also on the special leave petition to the extent that whether the petitioner is liable to pay interest @ 18% or not. There shall be interim stay of the operation of the impugned judgment."
1.  The only contention raised before us was whether the appellant was liable to pay interest at the rate of 18% or not as directed by the High Court. Since we have issued limited notice on the Special Leave Petition, we are not inclined to decide whether the question of limitation taken by the learned counsel for the appellant was justified or not. In that view of the matter and after hearing learned counsel for the parties, we direct to pay 9% interest instead of 18% interest as awarded by the arbitrator. With this modification, the appeal stands disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of
