Vijay Kumar Jain v State of Madhya Pradesh and Another
Supreme Court of India

31 October 1991
C.A. No. 1090 of 1981
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The dispute as to inter se seniority between appellant and respondent 2 was the subject matter of the writ petition before the High Court. The appellant claimed before the High Court that he was entitled to count the service of his ad hoc appointment for seniority upon regular selection by the Public Service Commission. That was not accepted.
2.   In our opinion, the High Court was right in not accepting that contention. There is no rule brought to our notice entitling the appellant to count his ad hoc service for the purpose of determining the seniority upon his selection by the PSC. His seniority can be taken only from the date of his selection by the PSC and he cannot claim seniority over respondent 2 who has been selected by the PSC earlier to him. Appeal therefore fails and is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
