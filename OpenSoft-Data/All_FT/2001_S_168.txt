Satyanarayan Mishra v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 July 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These petitions are under Article 32 by an employee of the LIC whose pay has been fixed after being discharged from the Army. The question of fixation of pay of Ex Defence Personnel on being appointed to the LIC has already been gone into by a 3-Judge Bench of this Court in O.K. Udayasankaran & ors. Vs. U.O.I. & Ors. The Court has come to a categorical conclusion that the paragraph on which the appointees in that case subsequent to 1.1.1988 were relying upon will not be applicable to those who had been appointed after 1.1.1988. Mr. Das appearing for the petitioner in the present case contended that a very vital document on the issue has not been placed before the Court while taking the earlier decision, and as such the right of the employee flowing from such document cannot be nullified on the basis of the earlier judgment of this Court. In support of this reliance has been placed on two judgments of this Court.
2. It is no doubt true that some observation made in the two cases might come to assistance of Mr. Das. Those observations are in the context of peculiar facts of those cases and will have no universal application. But having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, and on the materials on which the 3-Judge Bench has come to a conclusion on the question of applicability of the paragraph we are not in a position to entertain these present petitions under Article 32, and re-examine the matter afresh. The Writ Petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
