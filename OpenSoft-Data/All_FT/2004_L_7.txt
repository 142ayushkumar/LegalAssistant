Bhulan Rout and another v Lal Bahadur Yadav
Supreme Court of India

23 August 2004
C.A. No. 5424 of 2004 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 3472 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  By order dated 8-2-2001, the trial court allowed an application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC and set aside the ex parte decree passed against the applicants therein. Feeling aggrieved by the said order dated 8-2-2001, the plaintiffs filed an "appeal" in the Court of District Judge, Si wan which was allowed by order dated 4-10-2001. Against this order the defendants preferred a revision which has been dismissed by the High Court. They have come up to this Court by filing this petition for special leave.
2.  The only submission made by the learned counsel for the appellants is that the order dated 4-10-2001, passed by the learned District Judge, Siwan is without jurisdiction inasmuch as the order of the trial court passed on application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC and allowing the application by setting aside the ex parte decree could not have been appealed against.
3. A bare perusal of Order 43 CPC shows that an appeal is maintainable, insofar as an application under Order 9 Rule 13 CPC is concerned, only against an order rejecting an application and not against an order allowing the application. The appeal before the learned District Judge was wholly misconceived and not maintainable and the same could not have been allowed. The learned counsel for the respondent has found it difficult to dispute this legal position.
4.  The appeal is allowed. The order dated 4-10-2001, passed in MA No.8 of 2001 passed by the learned District Judge, Siwan is set aside as without jurisdiction and with that the order of the High Court passed in civil revision upholding the order of the learned District Judge also goes.
5.  Needless to say that the respondent herein is at liberty to avail such remedy against the order dated 8-2-2001, as may be available to him under the law, which if availed, shall be heard and determined on its own merits but we express no opinion thereon. No order as to the costs.
Appeal allowed.
