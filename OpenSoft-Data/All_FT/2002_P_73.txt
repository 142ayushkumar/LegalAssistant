Pran Singh v Toran Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 January 2002
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 7236/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We found no fault with the impugned order because a private party cannot file an appeal against an order of acquittal in a police charge sheeted case. The High Court in the impugned order held that an application for leave to appeal at the instance of the petitioner cannot be maintianed. It is legally a correct order.
2. However, it is open to the petitioner to move the High Court in revision. We make it clear that the impugned order shall not be prejudice to the right of the petitioner in making such a motion before the High Court. With these observations the SLP is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
