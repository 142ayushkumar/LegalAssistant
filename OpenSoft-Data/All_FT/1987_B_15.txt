Union of India and Another v Babu Ram Lalla
Supreme Court of India

20 February 1987
C.A. No. 1519 of 1973
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We agree wholly with the reasoning and conclusion of the High Court. Since the order of termination of service of the respondent was rightly held to be a nullity he was entitled to be paid salary on the footing that he had always continued in service and the void order was never in existence in the eyes of law.
2. The appeal therefore, fails and dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
