Supreme Court of India

7 March 2005
W.P. (C) No. 661 of 2004 with IAs Nos. 4-6
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Many of the issues sought to be raised in this petition are being argued in SLP (C) No. 9932 of 2004 before a seven-Judge Constitution Bench. The petitioners, however, seek interim order in regard to admissions in postgraduate courses. They pray that the results of common entrance test conducted by the petitioners on 21-2-2005 shall be permitted to be declared and admissions made to all the seats in that course. According to the schedule, for completion of admission process in the postgraduate courses, as provided in the Regulations framed by the Medical Council of India, the last date is 7th April insofar as all-India quota is concerned and 1st May insofar as State quota is concerned.
2. Ordinarily, the management quota shall be filled in by 1st May. The question being raised by the petitioners is that in the institution in question, being unaided minority institution, there cannot be any State quota.According to the State, the quota of fifty per cent which has been fixed is valid as per the notification dated 16-2-2005. According to them, the entrance examination has been announced to be held by the University on 3-4-2005.
3.  Be that as it may, for the present, awaiting the conclusion of the arguments and pronouncement of judgment in the cases before the seven-Judge Constitution Bench, we permit the petitioners to declare the result of the examination stated to have been held on 21-2-2005 and fill, for the present, fifty per cent of the seats in the postgraduate courses.
4.  The matter shall be listed in the last week of April, 2005.
Order accordingly.
