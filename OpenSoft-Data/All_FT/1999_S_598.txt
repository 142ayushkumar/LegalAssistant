K. Vidya Sagar v State of Uttar Pradesh and others
Supreme Court of India

13 August 1999
S.L.P. (C) No. 16237 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this special leave petition arising out of an order passed in a writ petition by the High Court of Allahabad, by an interim order, the Central Bureau of Investigation was directed to investigate into the grievances of the petitioner and pursuant to the said investigation, a report dated 7-5-1999 has been tiled.
2. In view of this report, the main grievance of the petitioner for taking criminal action against the respondents stands redressed.The other grievance of the petitioner is alleged forcible possession of the premises in question by the ex-landlady. So far as that grievance is concerned, in view of the diverse cases put forward in these proceedings arising out of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, in our view, it is not appropriate for us to examine the rival contentions which raise disputed questions of fact.
3. We therefore, leave that question open. We are not inclined to entertain the SLP arising out of the writ petition, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case. Whatever other grievance remains in spite of the report of CBI so far as the petitioner is concerned, he may ventilate the same in accordance with law.
The special leave petition is therefore, disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
