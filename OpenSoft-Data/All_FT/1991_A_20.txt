Abrar Ali and Another v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

4 December 1991
Cr.A. No. 110 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Though in this appeal at one time this Court altered the conviction of the appellants from one under Section 308 IPC to Section 325 IPC and had permitted compounding of the offence in order to promote peace and amity between the parties after the appellants had undergone about three months of rigorous imprisonment, which order was recalled later on the basis that wrong representations were made before this Court, still we feel that the cause adopted by this Court earlier should be ventured upon again though in a different way.
2.  Thus having heard learned counsel for the parties and having perused the judgment under appeal, we maintain the conviction of the appellants under Section 308 IPC but alter their sentence of imprisonment to the period already undergone adding it with a fine of Rs 12, 500 each, on the non-payment of which each of them shall undergo twenty months' rigorous imprisonment. The fine be paid within a period of six weeks from today. On the payment or recovery of fine, as the case may be, two sums of Rs 10, 000 as and when paid and recovered from the respective appellants shall be paid over to the complainant as compensation and the balance shall go to the State coffers.
3.   The learned Sessions Judge, Lucknow in whose Court the fine would be collected is required to give prompt intimation to the complainant of his right to come and receive the compensation as expeditiously as possible. With these orders, the appeal stands disposed of
Appeal disposed of.
