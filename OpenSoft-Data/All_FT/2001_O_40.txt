Mahanadi Coalfields Limited and Anr v Orissa Cement and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 September 2001
CIVIL APPEAL No. 5602/1995
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against an order of the Orissa High Court dated 7th May 1992 vacating the earlier order of stay. The stay was in relation to a notice that had been issued demanding the levy on the basis of the Cess Validation Act. This modified order of stay vacating the earlier stay granted was stayed by this Court.
2. Naturally, therefore, the initial order of stay, that was granted remained operative for this period. The liability to pay any levy for period 22.12.1989, the date on which the Orissa High Court struck down the Act, and 4.4.1991 the date upto which the Validation Act makes the validation in question, has already been considered and answered by this Court in a batch of cases arising out of judgment of Patna High Court. The pending Writ Petition in the Orissa High Court assailing the demand dated 17.3.1992 should be disposed of in the light of the judgment of this Court. So far as the impugned order dated 7th May 1992 is concerned, it no longer survives as a live issue to be answered in any manner.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
3.  The Orissa High Court is requested to dispose of the pending Writ Petition early.
Appeal disposed of.
