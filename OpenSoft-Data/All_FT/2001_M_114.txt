Gopal Sen v Madhya Pradesh State Roadways Corporation
Supreme Court of India

14 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7557/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  In the instant case, order of the Labour Court reinstating the appellant as a conductor was challenged in appeal. That appeal of the respondent was allowed whereupon a writ petition was filed. According to the averment in the writ petition, the same was filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution and one of the prayers made was for issuance of a writ of mandamus to the respondent to reinstate the appellant with all consequential benefits.
2.  The writ petition was dismissed by the learned Single Judge. Against the same, a letters parent appeal was filed which was dismissed by the Division Bench on the ground that the order of the Single Judge was passed on a petition under Article 227 and, therefore, an appeal was not maintainable.
3.  As has already been noticed hereinabove, the petition which was filed was under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. One of the prayers contained in the petition was the one contemplated by Article 226. This being so, the learned Single Judge was in error in regarding the petition filed as being only under Article 227. In as much as the petition which was filed was also under Article 226, a letters patent appeal against the decision of the Single Judge was maintainable.
4. We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the impugned order dated 1st November, 2000 of the Division Bench and direct the High Court to hear the letters patent appeal on merits.
Appeal allowed.
