M. M. P. Sinha v Steel Authority of India Limited and Another
Supreme Court of India

5 February 1997
W.P. (C) No. D21181 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We see no reason to entertain this petition by a person who does not have the background information or for that matter any expertise in this behalf.
2.  Even before we completed this order the learned counsel left the courtroom without waiting to listen to the order. We see no reason why this discourtesy was shown. Issue notice to him to show cause why action should not be taken against him.
Order accordingly.
