Development Credit Bank Limited v CCI Chambers Coop. Housing Society Limited
Supreme Court of India

9  May  2005
C.A. No. 2667 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
The respondent has made appearance in the Court.
1.  With the consent of the learned counsel for the parties, the appeal is heard finally.
2.  This appeal is filed by the opposite party before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short "the Commission") feeling aggrieved by the order dated 1-3-2005, whereby the Commission has directed the complaint to be tried by itself forming the opinion that it was not necessary to drive the complainant to the need of filing a civil suit.
3.  The principal grievance of the appellant before us is that it would be deprived of its right to cross-examine the deponents of the affidavits incorporating examination-in-chief tendered in evidence by the complainant in view of the decision dated 3-12-2004, in Original Petition No.233 of 1996, incorporating a practice direction of the Commission.
4. The direction requires the opposite parties to file interrogatories whereafter the Commission may permit further cross-examination or not, in its discretion.
5.  The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent before us i.e. the complainant in the Commission, has submitted that the complainant has no objection to the opposite party conducting a full-fledged cross-examination of the deponents of the affidavits filed on behalf of the complainant. We direct accordingly.
6.  Inasmuch as the deponents will be subjected to full-fledged cross-examination before the Commission, the Commission would be at liberty to form an opinion afresh, now or at any subsequent stage, whether it would like to conduct the trial before itself or refer the parties to the civil court.
7.  The appeal stands disposed of in the terms above said and the order of the Commission stands superseded by this order.
Appeal disposed of.
