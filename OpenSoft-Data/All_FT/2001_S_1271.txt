State of Uttar Pradesh v Shiv Dan Singh
Supreme Court of India

9 July 2001
Cr.A. Nos. 674-675 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned Counsel for the parties.
Leave granted.
1.  The impugned order passed by the High Court cannot be sustained on any ground. The High Court ought not to have quashed the proceedings under the NDPS Act by appreciating the evidence collected by the prosecution. It is alleged by the prosecution that Customs Officers have seized charas weighing 706 Kgs. (International market value Rs. 7.06 crores).
2. Hence, impugned orders passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Criminal Misc. Application Nos. 329 of 2000 and 330 of 2000 are quashed and set aside. The trial court is directed to proceed with the matter in accordance with the law without being influenced by any observation made in the impugned order.
3.  It would be open to the accused to raise all contentions including the contention that statements recorded under Section 108 of the Customs Act cannot be relied upon for connecting the accused with the crime, before the trial court. Appeals are allowed accordingly.
Appeals allowed.
