Registrar Of Companies, Tamil Nadu v A.P.V.Sundaram & Ors.
Supreme Court of India

22 October 2002
Cr.A. No.1058-1075 Of 2002 (Arising Out Of S.L.P.(Cr.) No.1083-1100/2002)
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties. Leave granted.
1.  On 22.2.2002, this Court passed the following order:
"Delay condoned. Learned ASG has submitted that under Section 58A of the Companies Act,1956, the offence is punishable for the imprisonment with a term which may extend upto 5 years. In view of this position, issue notice.Permission is granted to file additional documents."
2.  The High Court committed a patent error in assuming that the maximum punishment for the alleged offence said to have been committed by the respondents could only be six months. On that basis it held that the complaint filed beyond the period of six months as prescribed under Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was barred by time and in that view quashed the complaint filed by the appellant. Under Section 58A(6)(b) of the Companies Act, 1956 the punishment of imprisonment may extend to five years and also imposition of fine. This position could not be disputed by the learned counsel for the respondents.
3.  Hence, the impugned order is unsustainable. Consequently it is quashed. The appeals are allowed accordingly.
Appeals allowed.
