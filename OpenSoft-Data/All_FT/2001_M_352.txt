Supreme Court of India

17 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16667-16668/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, in our view there was no justification, on the facts of the present case, for the High Court to have passed strictures against Mr. Mahle who had not been served.
2. As far as the observations against the U.P. Financial Corporation are concerned, no castigation was called for especially as the Corporation is yet to receive back the money due from the respondents.
These appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Appeals disposed of.
