Prafulla Kumar Bera v Kabita Bera
Supreme Court of India

6 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2623/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The only point on which a husband has now filed the Special Leave Petition against the order passed by the High Court is that until the Magistrate will take a final decision under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the husband is directed to pay "interim maintenance at the rate which has been originally claimed".
2.  Learned counsel submits that this leads to confusion because under proceedings for restitution of conjugal rights as per Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act maintenance allowance had been granted by the civil court fixing Rs.700/- per month as for the wife and Rs.300/- for the child.
3. We make it clear that until the Magistrate finalises the amount of maintenance allowances to be paid in accordance with Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the interim maintenance shall be on a par with the amount fixed by the civil court under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.
4.  With these observations this Special Leave Petition is disposed of and the Magistrate will now decide the claim made by the wife under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Petition disposed of.
