Rohtas Bhankhar and Others v Union of India and Another
Supreme Court of India

2 December 1999
S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 1167-68 of 1999 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 6 November 1998 in OAs Nos. 499 and 849 of 1998 of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi)
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  In the order dated 8-10-1999 1999 Indlaw SC 623, it was observed that inasmuch as in Kuldeep Singh case  1997 Indlaw SC 22841997 Indlaw SC 2284 decided by a Bench of three Judges, the observations of the Constitution Bench in Indra Sawhney case 1992 Indlaw SC 7351991 Indlaw SC 735 and the observations in Vinod Kumar case  1996 Indlaw SC 20891996 Indlaw SC 2089 were not noticed, this case should be placed before a Bench of three Judges.
2.  The decision in Kuldeep Singh case  1997 Indlaw SC 22841997 Indlaw SC 2284 was by a Bench of three Judges which, as already noted, had not referred to the majority decision in Indra Sawhney case  1992 Indlaw SC 7351991 Indlaw SC 735 which was delivered by a Constitution Bench. As the correctness of the decision in Kuldeep Singh case  1997 Indlaw SC 22841997 Indlaw SC 2284 is in doubt, it will be appropriate that this case is heard by a Constitution Bench.
3.  Our attention has also been drawn to a recent three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in Haridas Parsedia v. Urmila Shakya 1999 Indlaw SC 843 wherein it was observed that in the case of departmental promotion examination which is held exclusively for SCs/STs, there could be reduction to the extent of 10 per cent in the passing marks.
4. This decision does not refer to the observations of this Court in Indra Sawhney case 1992 Indlaw SC 7351991 Indlaw SC 735 which appears to lay down, in clear terms, that there cannot be dilution of standards in matters of promotion.
5.  Papers be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders.
Order accordingly.
