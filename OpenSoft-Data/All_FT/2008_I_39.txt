Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited v Indian Railway Major and Minor Caterers Association and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 March 2008
Appeal (Civil) 1336 of 2006 With C.A.No. 1362/2006; C.A. No. 1813/2006
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  These appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated 24/1/2006 passed by the Division Bench of Orissa High Court. By the impugned order, the High Court has interfered with the Catering Policy of 2005 in respect of reservations. By now it is a well settled principle of law that policy decisions of the Government should not be interfered in a routine manner unless the policy is contrary to the provisions of statutory rules or of the Constitution. Nothing has been brought to our notice that the Policy is contrary to the provisions of the statutory rules or the Constitution.
2.  For this simple reason, we set aside the order of the High Court impugned herein. The appeals are allowed.
C.A. NO.1813/2006
3. In view of the order passed in C.A.NO.1336/2006 and C.A. NO.1362/2006, this appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
