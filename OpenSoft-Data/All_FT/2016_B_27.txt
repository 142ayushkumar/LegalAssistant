The Judgment was delivered by : Anil R. Dave, J.
1. Heard the learned counsel for the appellants.
2. Leave granted.
3. Looking at the peculiar facts of the case, without issuing notice, we are disposing of these appeals. If the respondents are aggrieved by this order, it would be open to them to approach this court by filing an application.
4. It is an admitted fact that the appellants are having right in respect of the land in question and the respondents have also claimed their right in the land in question. So far as the amount which is claimed by the respondents may not be disbursed in favour of the appellants but the amount in respect of which the respondents have no right, may be disbursed in favour of the appellants.
5. In the circumstances, we set aside the impugned judgments and remit these matters to the High Court so that the High Court can pass an appropriate order after considering the facts of these appeals in accordance with law.
