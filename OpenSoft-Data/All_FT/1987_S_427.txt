M. D. N. Pannikar and Others v Steel Authority of India and Another
Supreme Court of India

30 November 1987
Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 1056 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The respondents are willing to pay the overtime as directed by this Court's order dated September 2, 1986. The only dispute is as to working out the method; as to at what rates and for what period the payment will be made and to what persons. It will be just and proper that the learned District Judge, Sundergarh will determine whatever materials are made available to him by either of the parties as to these points. If no material is available then he will proceed on a rough and ready basis as he considers suitable and fit.
2. The learned District Judge will make such determination within three months from today and the payments will be made within four weeks thereafter. This will not prejudice the rights of the parties, if any, to agitate any grievances arising out of such determination.
3.  The CMP is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
