B. A. Balasubramaniam and Bros. Company v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

22 January 1998
C.A. Nos. 1515 to 1517 of 1985 (From the judgment and order Dt. 27 February 1984 of the Madras High Court in TC Nos. 813 to 815 of 1979, reported as CIT vs. B. A. Balasubramaniam & Bros. 1984 40 CTR (Mad) 217 : 1985 152 ITR 529 (Mad))
The Order of the Court was as follows:
BY THE COURT
1.  In these appeals the question involved relates to the interpretation of the Expln. to s. 271(1)(c) of the IT Act for the purpose of levying penalty on the concealed income. The High Court, on a reference having been made, has come to the conclusion that as the difference between the income assessed and the income returned was more than 20 per cent., therefore, the said Explanation became applicable and the ITO was justified in imposing penalty because the assessee had not been able to discharge the onus which was on it under the said Explanation. For the interpretation of the said provision we need to refer to three decisions of this Court, viz., CIT vs. Mussadilal Ram Bharose 1987 Indlaw SC 1791987 Indlaw SC 28123 , CIT vs. K. R. Sadayappan 1990 Indlaw SC 4781990 Indlaw SC 478and Addl. CIT vs. Jeevan Lal Sah 1993 Indlaw SC 6281993 Indlaw SC 628. In these decisions it has been clearly stated that with the incorporation of the Expln. to s. 271, the view which had been taken earlier in CIT vs. Anwar Ali 1970 Indlaw SC 492, no longer holds the field and it is for the assessee to discharge the onus as contemplated in the said Explanation.
2. In view of the fact that in the instant case the onus has not been discharged, the High Court judgment calls for no interference. The appeals are accordingly dismissed but with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
