Daula Ram v State of Rajasthan
Supreme Court of India

31 August 1998
Cr.A. No. 888 of 1998 (arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 2130 of 1998), Dt. 31 August 1998.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted, limited to the question of sentence.
1.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, particularly the facts that since the offence was committed more than 20 years have elapsed and that he has served a substantial part of the sentence ,we feel that justice will be sufficiently met if the substantive sentence of rigorous imprisonment for one year imposed upon the appellant for his conviction under Section 161 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and under Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 is reduced to the period already undergone and we order accordingly.
2. The sentence of fine and the imprisonment to be undergone in lieu of payment thereof will however stand. The appellant who is in jail may be released on payment of the fine (if not already paid) or in default of payment thereof, on serving the sentence imposed for such default.
The appeal is thus disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
