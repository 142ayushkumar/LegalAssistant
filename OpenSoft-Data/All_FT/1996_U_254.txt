Servo Electronics v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 October 1996
C.A. No. 2759 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal in the judgment and order under appeal has rightly found that the onus lay upon the a appellant to establish that what had started out in Sheds Nos. 83 and 84 as a single unit had become two separate independent units.
2.   Upon the material before it, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that it was not established that the two sheds now constituted independent units. There is no perversity in the order of the Tribunal; its conclusion is reasonable upon the record.
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
