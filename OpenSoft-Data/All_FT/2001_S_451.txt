Gurdavinder Singh Brar v State Bank of Patiala
Supreme Court of India

20 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13604/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We do not see any reason for interfering with the decision of the courts below. A suit for recovery of money, by the respondent, was filed in 1989. Nearly, twelve years have elapsed. It is a sorry commentary on the state of affairs before the trial court.
2. We direct the trail court to take up the suit and try it on a day to day basis and dispose of the same with a judgment within four months from today and report compliance. Order be sent to the Registrar, High Court of Delhi for communication to the Judge concerned.
The special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
