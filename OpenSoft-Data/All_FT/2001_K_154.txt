Attar Singh v Karora Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)........CC 7108/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  This special leave petition seeks leave to file appeal against the impugned order dated 15/2/2001 passed by the High Court whereby the Second Appeal has been admitted without framing any substantial question of law as mandatorily required by Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code. The petitioner, i.e., the respondent before the High Court can still invite attention of the High Court to non-compliance with Section 100 of the C.P.C., and if no substantial question of law is arising for decision in the second appeal then also seek dismissal of the appeal from the High Court itself.
2.  That being the situation, we are not inclined to interfere with the order of the High Court in this petition at the instance of the respondent before the High Court.
The special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
