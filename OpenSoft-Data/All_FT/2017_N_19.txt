(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. There is a dispute as to what rate the respondents, who apparently are in possession of certain excess land than what is granted by the appellant-Board, should pay for the excess land.
3. Heard Mr. Gaurab Banerji, learned senior counsel appearing for the Board, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents as well as the learned Amicus Curiae. We are of the view that having regard to the entire background of the case, the interests of justice will be served if the respondents are directed to pay the land value at the reckoning rate of 1998-1999 fixed by the State Government, along with simple interest at the rate of 6% from the date of allotment. Ordered accordingly.
4. In view of the above, the appeals are disposed of.
