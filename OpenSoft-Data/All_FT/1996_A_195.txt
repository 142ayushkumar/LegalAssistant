"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, and having regard to the provisions of section 187(2) of the Income-tax Act, the Appellate Tribunal is correct in law in holding that consequent to the death of partner Alagappan on May 28, 1976, two separate assessments and not one assessment should be made for the assessment year 1977-78"
