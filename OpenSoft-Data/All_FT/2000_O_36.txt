Orissa State Leather Corporation Ltd. and Anr v Debrup Das and Anr
Supreme Court of India

1 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3651-3652/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Though a very interesting question of law has been raised in these appeals as to whether in case of closure of an establishment any disciplinary inquiry remains over to be continued by such establishment or not.
We need not examine this question inasmuch as the charges in respect of which inquiry is sought to be held against respondent No. 1 is of such a nature which will not involve any monetary and financial liability and hence no useful purpose will be served if we hold in favour of the appellant to proceed with the inquiry as the establishment has already been closed.
2. In this view of the matter, we think these appeals have become infructuous and shall stand dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
