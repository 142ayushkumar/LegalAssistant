National Insurance Company Limited v Nasim Murshed and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10616/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the insurance company contended that the bar contained in Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against the insurance company will subsists only in the event of the person against whom the claim is made was contesting the claim.
2. If an insured failed to challenge the quantum of award passed by him by filing an appeal it would amount to his failure to continue to contest the claim and in that case it will be open to the insurance company to file an appeal in challenge of the quantum. He wanted to draw support to his proposition on the language of Section 173(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act which says that:
"any person aggrieved by an award of a claims tribunal may file an appeal".
3.  That expression according to the learned counsel will include the insurance company in a situation when the insured did not choose to file an appeal challenging the quantum fixed by the tribunal.
We feel that above contention requires consideration.
Issue notice. Dasti permitted.
4.  If the Insurance Company will deposit with the Tribunal 50% of the awarded amount within four weeks from today there will be a stay of execution of the award regarding the balance. If the 50% of the awarded amount is deposited the disbursement of it will be governed by the decision of this Court in G.M. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, Trivandrum vs. Susamma Thomas (Mrs.) and Ors. 1993 Indlaw SC 1302.
Order accordingly.
