Mira Bhagat v Arabinda Bhagat
Supreme Court of India

25 January 2005
Transfer Petition (C) No. 741 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Admitted.
1.  On the facts and circumstances of this case, we think it not possible to accede to the request of the petitioner to transfer the case from the Asansol court to the Raipur court especially in view of the fact that the respondent husband is to look after a disabled boy and two minor girls. Therefore, we think it appropriate that the case should continue in the Asansol court itself.
2. However, we make it clear that the respondent husband will pay for the expenses of the petitioner herein and her escort for travelling from Raipur to Asansol for the purpose of appearing in the case. Such amount for travelling from Raipur to Asansol so required shall be decided by the Asansol court.
With the above observations, this transfer petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
