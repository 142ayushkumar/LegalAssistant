Union of India and another v Ratan Lal Agarwal (D) TR. LRS.
Supreme Court of India

21 July 2010
C.A. No(s). 3048 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This Appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 15th February 2007 passed in Civil Revision No.360 of 2006.
2.  The facts in detail have been set out in the impugned judgment and hence we are not repeating the same here.
3.  Admittedly, the lease granted in favour of the appellants expired in the year 1995 but they have not vacated the premises.
4.  Mr. Mohan Parasaran, learned Additional Solicitor General relies on the decision of this Court in Chief Executive Officer vs. Surendra Kumar Vakil and Others1999 Indlaw SC 1024. The facts of that case are totally different from the facts of the present case.
5. In that case, the government issued notice for resumption of the grant in the cantonment area on the ground that the occupant had violated certain terms of the grant. In the present case, there is no such pleadings of violation of the grant.
6.  Hence, we are of the opinion that there is no merit in this appeal and it is accordingly dismissed. No costs. However, the appellants are granted six months time from today to vacate the premises in question on furnishing usual undertaking before this Court within six weeks from today.
7.  We make it clear that we are not expressing any opinion as to whether the respondents violated any terms of the grant and it is always open to the government to take action for resumption of the lease in accordance with law if the respondents violated any terms of the grant.
Appeal dismissed.
