Ahmedabad Panjrapole Sanstha v Miscellaneous Mazdoor Sabha and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 December 1986
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 5604 of 1986 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 24 March 1986 of the High Court of Gujarat in SC.A. No. 1103 of 1986).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are inclined to agree with the petitioner that there is much to say that this institute is within the ambit of the statute namely Bombay Shops and Establishments Act.
2.  Minimum wages fixed by the State Government does not seem to be a sufficient return for the day's work. Payment of arrears be made by the end of February 1987 on the basis of the minimum wages now to be fixed for which the counsel for the petitioner agrees to meet the burden without our finally deciding this question.
Petition disposed of.
