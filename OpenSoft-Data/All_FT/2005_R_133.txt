Ramdas Athawale v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

20 January 2005
W.P. (C) No. 86 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Prima facie we are of the opinion that this petition is rendered infructuous in view of the Lok Sabha having been dissolved. Thus the present petition is of academic interest only inasmuch as the petitioner cannot be allowed any relief.
2. The learned counsel for the petitioner insists on arguing the matter on merits and submits that either the matter should be heard by a Constitution Bench or the order dated 13-9-2004 should be recalled.
List before the Bench which passed the order dated 13-9-2004.
Order accordingly.
