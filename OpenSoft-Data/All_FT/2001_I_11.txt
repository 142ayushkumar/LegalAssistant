Mehsana District Central Co-Operative Bank Limited v Income Tax Officer, Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

30 August 2001
C.A. Nos. 7448 & 7449 of 2000 (C.A. Nos. 292 to 298 of 2001).
The Order of the Court is as follows:
Civil Appeal Nos. 292 to 298 of 2001
1.   We are concerned in these appeals with the asst. yrs. 1988-89 to 1994-95.
2.   The High Court reframed the questions that arise in these appeals thus :
"(1) Whether the Tribunal was right in law in disallowing the claim of the assessee-bank for deduction under s. 80P(2)(a)(i) in respect of income earned from utilization of its reserve funds being statutory reserves under s. 67(2) of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961 ?
(2) Whether the assessee bank is entitled to claim deduction under s. 80P(2)(a)(i) in respect of income earned from utilization of its voluntary reserves other than the statutory reserves mentioned above ?
(3) Whether the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the locker rent is not deductible under s. 80P(2)(a)(i) ?
2. Insofar as the first question is concerned, it is covered against the Revenue by the judgment delivered by this Court on 22nd August, 2001, in CIT vs. Karnataka State Co-operative Apex Bank (Civil Appeal Nos. 4646 to 4648 of 2000)2001 Indlaw SC 282.
3. The first question, therefore, is answered in the negative and in favour of the assessee.
3. Insofar as the third question is concerned, it is clear that the provision of safe deposit vaults is part of the ordinary banking business of a bank; this is shown by s. 6(1)(a) of the Bank Regulation Act, 1949. Therefore, the income derived by the assessee from the hiring out of safe deposit vaults is income from the business of banking and, therefore, deductible under s. 80P(2)(a)(i) of the IT Act,1961.
4. Accordingly, the third question is answered in the negative and in favour of the assessee.
4. Now, as to the second question we have heard learned counsel and been referred to various decisions, including the decision of this Court in Bihar State Co-operative Bank Ltd. vs. CIT 1960 Indlaw SC 418To be able to answer the question, it is necessary to ascertain, as a fact, whether the income derived by the assessee from the investment of its voluntary reserves has been utilised by it in the course of its ordinary banking business. Though the assessee placed before the assessing authority its books of account and balance sheets, the fact aforestated was not considered at any stage, for one or other reason on which it is not necessary for us to dilate. We think that it is in the interests of justice that the assessee should have the opportunity to lead evidence before the CIT(A) to establish as a fact what is stated above.
5. So far as the second question is concerned, therefore, the matter stands restored to the CIT(A) for being decided afresh. He shall also decide any consequential issue that may arise. Order on the appeals accordingly. No order as to cost.
Civil Appeal Nos. 7748 and 7449 of 2000
5. The only question in these appeals reads thus :
" Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, Tribunal was right in law in holding that the assessee is not eligible for deduction under s. 80P in respect of interest income on its total reserve, and in holding so, ignoring its own decision as also the judgments of the Rajasthan High Court and the Supreme Court ?"
6. Insofar as the interest income upon statutory reserves is concerned, the question must be answered in favour of the assessee, in the light of the judgment delivered by us in CIT vs. Karnataka State Co-operative Apex Bank (Civil Appeal Nos. 4646-4648 of 2000) (supra). As far as the interest income on non-statutory reserves is concerned, the matter is remanded to the CIT(A) for being decided afresh in the light of the decision that we have just rendered in Civil Appeal Nos. 292 to 298 of 2001 (supra).
6. Accordingly, the civil appeals are allowed and the judgment under appeal is set aside.
No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
