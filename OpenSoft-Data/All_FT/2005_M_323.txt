Kanhaiyalal Kataria and others v Mukul Chaturvedi and others
Supreme Court of India

14 February 2005
C.A. No. 1207 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 8424 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal is filed only for the enhancement of quantum of compensation. The deceased was 32 years of age. He was a bachelor and was doing ice cream business. An award in the sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- (Rupees two lakhs and fifty thousand) has been passed taking the multiplier of 16. Our attention has been drawn to the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 in which we find that for age between 30 to 35 years multiplier of 17 has been indicated.
2. Learned counsel for the claimants made submissions seeking enhancement of compensation on the ground that the income of the deceased has not been properly estimated. We are not going into any other aspect except the question of proper multiplier for computation of compensation.
3.  In our opinion, by taking the multiplier of 17, the amount of compensation deserves to be increased. The compensation amount may be suitably recomputed by the Tribunal by applying the multiplier of 17 and interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum on the increased amount be also granted.
4.  With the aforesaid modification to be made to the award, the appeal is partly allowed to the above extent. No order as to costs.
Appeal partly allowed.
