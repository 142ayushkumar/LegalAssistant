State of Rajasthan and another v Ghyan Chand
Supreme Court of India

28 July 2006
C.A. No. 3214 of 2006 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 20379 of 2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the High Court should not have interfered with the quantum of damages awarded by the Labour Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 11-A of the Industrial Disputes Act.
2. The Labour Court had directed payment of compensation keeping in view the fact that the respondent was a project employee and was not in service since June 1990. We do not find any justification for the High Court to arrive at a conclusion that reinstatement with 50% back wages will meet the ends of justice.
3.  We, therefore, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, in modification of the order passed by the High Court, direct that the respondent shall be entitled to be paid a sum of Rs.50,000/-. State of M.P. v. Arjunlal Rajak 2006 Indlaw SC 260, Nagar Mahapalika v. State of U.P. 2006 Indlaw SC 218 and Haryana State Electronics Development Corpn. Ltd. v. Mamni 2006 Indlaw SC 190.
4.  It is stated by Mr.Aruneshwar Gupta, learned counsel appearing for the appellants that the awarded amount has already been deposited. The respondent shall be entitled to withdraw the said amount together with interest, if any. The appellant shall pay to the respondent and/or deposit a sum of Rs.27,000/- before the Labour Court within eight weeks from today, failing which the said amount shall carry interest at the rate of 6% per annum from date till the actual date of payment/deposit.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
