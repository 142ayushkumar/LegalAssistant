Md. Shakoor Mian v Raj Mangal Mishra and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 August 1999
C.A. No. 4874 of 1999 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 22699 of 1997)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The matter involved in this case pertains to the proceedings held under the Bihar Consolidation of Holdings and Prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"). Sections 37-A and 37-B of the Act provide as under:
"37-A. Authorities under the Act to be deemed courts of competent jurisdiction.-Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force, the Director of Consolidation, the Deputy Director of Consolidation, the Assistant Director of Consolidation, the Consolidation Officer and the Assistant Consolidation Officer shall be deemed to be courts of competent jurisdiction while hearing objections or appeals or deciding disputes under this Act.
37-B. Authorities under this Act to have powers and privileges as are vested in a civil court in certain matters.-
(1) The Director of Consolidation, the Deputy Director of Consolidation, the Assistant Director of Consolidation, the Consolidation Officer and the Assistant Consolidation Officer shall have all such powers, rights and privileges while hearing any matter in dispute as are vested in a civil court in respect of the following matters, namely,-
(a) enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath, affirmation or otherwise and issuing a commission to examine witnesses;
(b) compelling any person for the production of any document;
(c) punishing the persons guilty of contempt
(2) A summons signed by such officer may be substituted for and shall be equivalent to any formal process capable of being issued in any action by a civil court for enforcing the attendance of witnesses and compelling the production of any document."
2.  Relying upon these provisions and also on an earlier decision of the High Court in Ram Sigashan Pathak v. K. P. Sinhal,  the learned Single Judge of the High Court before whom the decision of the Consolidation Authorities was challenged by the respondent, allowed the writ petition and remanded the matter to the Consolidation Officer, Mahua, District Vaishali, as it was found that the evidence had not been brought on record in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act and the Civil Procedure Code.
The letters patent appeal filed thereafter was dismissed as the High Court was not inclined to interfere in the matter where a case has been remanded. It, however, directed that the case would be heard by the revisional authority, namely, the Director of Consolidation. It is against this decision that the present appeal has been filed.
3.  Our attention has been drawn to the judgments passed by the Consolidation Authorities at various levels in which the evidence adduced by the parties has been noticed. It is also pointed out that the decision of the Single Judge in Ram Sigashan case 1988 Indlaw PAT 100which was relied upon by the High Court, had already been overruled by the Division Bench of the Patna High Court itself in Junaid Khan v. State of Bihar and, therefore, there was no occasion to issue a direction to the revisional authority, to which the case was remanded for disposal in accordance with the decision in Ram Sigashan cases.
4.  The High Court has not touched the merits of the case as it was of the opinion that the evidence was not brought on record in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act and the Civil Procedure Code which had to be followed as the Consolidation Authorities were regular courts in view of the provisions contained in Sections 37-A and 37-B of the Act.
5. Since the High Court had itself overruled the decision in Ram Sigashan case, there was no occasion for the Single Judge or the Division Bench to place reliance on that decision. While considering the scope of the provisions of Sections 37-A and 37-B of the Act, the Division Bench of the Patna High Court presided over by the then Chief Justice G. B. Pattanaik (as his Lordship then was), observed as under:
"24, In fact Section 37-B of the Act qualifies the scope of Section 37-A. This Section 37-A of the Act is more comprehensive and general in nature. It postulates that all the Consolidation Authorities while deciding objections, appeals or revisions, would be deemed to be courts. What Section 37-B restricts is that the Consolidation Authorities would be treated to be courts, but only for enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath, compelling any person for production of any documents etc. Section 37-B of the Act is substantially added by the legislature to operate as a proviso.
25, Keeping in view the duties to be performed by the Consolidation Authorities and as they decide the rights of the parties and obtain documentary and oral evidence of the parties and also examine the witnesses on oath, they are to be assumed as courts with competent jurisdiction with the help of legal fiction created by legislature, but in fact they are not courts."
6.  The Consolidation Authorities have been given powers as are available to civil courts for limited purposes specified in Sections 37-A and 37-B of the Act, but the Consolidation Authorities cannot be equated with regular courts. While specifying the powers of the Consolidation Authorities, it was specifically pointed out in Section 37-B quoted above that the Consolidation Authorities, while hearing any matter in dispute, shall have all such powers, the rights and privileges which are available to a civil court in respect of the matters including enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath, affirmation or otherwise and issuing a commission to examine witnesses; or to compel any person to produce documents. The Consolidation Authorities were also vested with the power to punish a person guilty of contempt.
7. This, however, does not mean that the documents or the oral evidence could have been brought on record only in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Evidence Act as the evidence could legally be brought on record in accordance with the procedure by the Consolidation Authorities.
8.  The evidence had already been led by the parties and the same was brought on record and duly considered by the Consolidation Authorities. The Joint Director (Consolidation), while considering the revision has noticed as under:
"The plaintiff has produced the following documentary evidence in support of his case.

22. Copy of order passed by the Court of Deputy Director (Consolidation), Vaishali, in Appeal No. 35 of 1993

13. Copy of affidavit given by Defendant 6."
9.  After enumerating the documents which were filed by the parties, the Deputy Director further observed as under:
"None of the parties has produced copies of postings made in the record at the time of present survey and the copy of map of present survey, therefore, the map of present survey and postings made in the record at the time of present survey were called for and perused. The original copy of Letter No. 1070 dated 9-3-1987 sent by the SDM, Mahua to the Consolidation Officer, Mahua is available on record in which it has been stated that the Regional Officer accompanied by the Regional Inspector and the employee concerned made inspection of land."
10.  It will thus be seen that full opportunity was given to the parties to adduce their evidence, and the evidence, in fact, had been brought on record which was duly considered by the Consolidation Authorities. The High Court was clearly in error in interfering with the findings recorded by the Consolidation Authorities, on the technical plea that the evidence had not been brought on record in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act.
11.  In view of the above, we allow the appeal, set aside the judgment dated 30-3-1995 passed by the learned Single Judge as also the judgment dated 7-7-1997 passed by the Division Bench and remand the case to the Division Bench of the High Court to hear the letters patent appeal afresh and dispose of the same on merits in accordance with law. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
