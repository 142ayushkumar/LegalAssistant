Pattaswamy Ramachandra Rao v G.Veerabhadram and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11213/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We are of the opinion that the circumstances of the case do not warrant our interference with the impugned order.
2.  We are informed that the Receiver has taken possession of the property in question about two years back. The High Court had already directed that the suit should be disposed of by the Agent to Government, i.e.the 2nd, 4th respondent herein, within a period of 4 months from the date of receipt of a copy of its order, (dated 28th April, 2000). Now more than 8 months have lapsed.
3. We hope that the suit which is reported to be pending would be disposed of shortly. However, we direct the 4th respondent to dispose of the suit within three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
4.  The SLP is dismissed accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.
