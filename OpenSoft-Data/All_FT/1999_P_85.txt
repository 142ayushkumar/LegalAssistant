Agio Countertrade Private Limited v Punjab Iron and Steel Company Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

Arbitration Petitions Nos. 24 and 27 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These petitions are under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for appointment of an arbitrator. The respondent Companies in both these petitions are before the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 1993 Indlaw SC 870 in which this Court interpreted Section 22(1) to include proceedings under the State Financial Corporations Act. Hence these proceedings would be suspended.
2. In the case of Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v. Church of South India Trust Assn. 1992 Indlaw SC 12841992 Indlaw SC 1284 this Court held that pending eviction proceedings taken by a private landlord against the sick company were not covered by Section 22(1) and could be proceeded with. This judgment, however, was prior to the amendment to Section 22(1).
3.  None of these judgments deals with proceedings under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Hence the matters may be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders.
Order accordingly.
