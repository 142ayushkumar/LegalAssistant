Hari Shankar Prasad v Shahid Ali Khan and others
Supreme Court of India

24 January 2005
IAs Nos. 4-5 in C.A. No. 4621 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  By judgment dated 13-3-2003 passed in Hari Shankar Prasad v. Shahid Ali Khan 2003 Indlaw SC 229 the election of Respondent 1 was set aside, while the late Hari Shankar Prasad, the father of the present applicant, was declared elected under Sections 100 and 101 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
2.  The applicant seeks a clarification that this Court may specifically say in terms of sub-section (1) of Section 100 and Section 101 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 that the said relief was allowed by this Court by holding the election of Respondent 1 to be void.
3. In asmuch as the election of Respondent 1 has been set aside and the late Hari Shankar Prasad has been declared elected, it is obvious that the election of Respondent 1 has been held to be void and that finding is implicit in the judgment of this Court. No further clarification is called for.
The IAs be treated as disposed of.
Applications disposed of.
