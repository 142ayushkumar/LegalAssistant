Additional Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay v Messrs Scottish India Machine Tools Limited
Supreme Court of India

11 March 1987
C.A. No. 1990 of 1974
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing learned counsel appearing for the Revenue, we are satisfied that the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal does five rise to a question of law and the High Court should have called for a reference under Section 256(2) of the Income Tax, 1961. We find that the Karnataka High Court in Kirloskar Asea Ltd. v. CIT 1979 Indlaw KAR 30 has taken a country view.
2.  Accordingly we allow the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court and direct the Tribunal to refer to the High Court the following question for the opinion of the High Court namely:
" Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that a sum of Rs. 96, 989 being the surplus realised by the assessee on the repatriation of the sterling balance on July 7, 1967 is not chargeable to income-tax under the capital gains under Section 45 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 for the assessment year 1968-69."
There is no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
