Ratan Sharma v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

26 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 6734/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The order of pre-arrest bail has been granted by this court to this petitioner on a condition that he should surrender within six weeks. Unfortunately that period of six weeks expired on 24.8.2001 as the petitioner was away in a foreign country (Taiwan). He could reach India only on 25.8.2001. He applied for extension of time for surrender which was not granted.
2. We think it not necessary to give notice to the respondent-State. We extend the time for surrender by two weeks from today in terms of the order dated 13.7.2001 of the High Court.
Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
