Union of India and Others v Messrs Tirumala Granites
Supreme Court of India

19 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18786/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the observations of the High Court to the effect "that the reasons which have been stated in the counter do not conform to the provisions enumerated for consideration under Rule 5(2)(a) to (d)" are not correct.
2. The counsel for the parties agree that by disregarding the said observations the matter may be decided afresh in the event of the respondent making an application for the grant of mining lease. As and when that application is made to the State Government, the same shall be dealt with in accordance with law. It goes without saying that no mining operation in a reserved forest can be carried out without express prior permission of the Central Government. This appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Appeal disposed of.
