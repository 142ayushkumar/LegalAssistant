Messrs Dandeli Steel and Ferro Alloys Limited v State of Karnataka
Supreme Court of India

17 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18627/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
Leave is granted.
1.  This appeal is directed against the order of the High Court of Karnataka at Banglore in Writ Appeal No.2659/2000 dated July 19, 2000. By the impugned order the High Court declined to condone the delay of 109 days in filing the Writ Appeal against the order of the learned Single Judge in W.P.No.38431/1992 made on September 16, 1999.
2.  A perusal of the affidavit filed before the High Court in support of the petition to condone the delay shows that the delay has occurred due to inaction of the advocate in forwarding the copy of the order of the learned Single Judge to the appellant-Company immediately after receipt of the same. It was only when the liaison officer contacted, that copy of the order was handed over to him.
3.  The High Court relied on judgment of this Court in P.K. Ramachandran vs. State of Kerala & Anr..
4. In our view that case is clearly distinguishable on facts. The principle in regard to the condonation of delay laid down by this Court in N. Balakrishnan vs. M.Krishnamurthy, ought to have been kept in mind while dealing with the cases of condonation of delay.
5.  On the facts of the case we are satisfied that the delay has been properly explained. In the circumstances of the case we set aside the order under challenge, condone the delay in filing the Writ Appeal, but having regard to the inconvenience suffered by the respondent, on payment of costs of Rs.5,000/- to the counsel for the respondent within two weeks from today. The Writ Apeal is restored to the file of the High Court to be disposed of on merits in accordance with law.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
