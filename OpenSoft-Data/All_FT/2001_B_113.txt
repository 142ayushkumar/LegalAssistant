Bank of India and Others v Sudarsh Awasthi
Supreme Court of India

10 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10961/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  Two charges of misconduct were alleged by the appellants against the respondent. The first charge was unauthorised absence from duty since 4th February, 1989 and the second charge related to non-joining of duty by the respondent upon his transfer to Farrukhabad Gramin Bank.
2.  Both the charges were held to be proved and with regard to the first charge order of removal were passed and with regard to the second charge also a similar order was passed.
3. On challenge being made, the High Court came to the conclusion that the respondent could not be posted in Farrukhabad Gramin Bank on deputation because his consent had not been taken. This part of the judgment of the High Court is unexceptionable and, therefore, merits no interference.
4.  The High Court, however, did not deal with the first charge, namely, unauthorised absence of the respondent before his transfer to Gramin Bank but after 4th February, 1989.
5.  Without going into the merits of the question and keeping in view the fact that there is no denial of the fact that from 4th February, 1989 till the order of transfer to Gramin Bank, and in fact till today, the respondent has not been attending to his duties we feel that some punishment with regard to the first charge was called for.
6. After taking into consideration the facts on record and with the consent of the parties, we feel that the ends of justice would be met by directing the reinstatement of the respondent but without any back wages and he should be given the post which he was holding under the appellant as on 4th February, 1989. Ordered accordingly. It will be appropriate, in our opinion that the respondent is posted at a place other than Lucknow.
The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Appeal disposed of.
