Samar Kumar Das v State of West Bengal and others
Supreme Court of India

3 March 2017
Civil Appeal No. 3590 of 2017, [Arising from Special Leave Petition (C) No. 29138/2015]
The Order of the Court was as follows :
(Non-Reportable)
1. Leave granted.
2. The appellant is aggrieved, since his application for voluntary retirement was not considered favourably on the ground that he did not fulfill the requirement under Rule 75(aaa) of the West Bengal Service Rules. The relevant portion of Rule 75(aaa) reads as under:-
"75(aaa) - Any Government employee may, by giving notice of not less than 3 months in writing to the appointing authority, retire from Government service after he has attained the age of 50 years, if he is in Group A or Group B (erstwhile gazette) service or post, and had entered Government Service before attaining the age of 35 years; and in all other cases, after he attained the age of 55 years, provided that it shall be open to the appointing authority to withhold permission to a Government employee under suspension who seeks to retire under this sub-rule."
3. It is not in dispute that the appellant entered service after he attained the age of 35 years. At the time, when he made the application, he had not completed either 20 years of service or 55 years of age. Now, that the appellant has crossed the age of 55 years and also completed 20 years of service as well. Hence, the appellant is permitted to make a fresh application, in which case the said application will be considered by the Competent Authority and orders in accordance with law will be passed within a period of one month from the date of presentation of the application.
4. In that view of the matter, we leave open the question of law and dispose of the appeal.
5. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
6.
7. There shall be no orders as to costs.
Appeal disposed of
