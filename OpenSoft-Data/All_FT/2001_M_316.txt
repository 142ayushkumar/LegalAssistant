M. Saroja and Others v Messrs Everlast Fiberglass Prod.Pvt.Ltd
Supreme Court of India

9 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12178/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We do not find any merit in the petition. The Special Leave Petition is dismissed. It was then urged by the learned counsel for the petitioners that in pursuance of the earlier order, the petitioners came in possession over the premises in dispute and if they are required to vacate the premises, they would suffer great hardship and, therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. Counsel for the respondent has no objection.
2. We, accordingly, grant time to the petitioners till 30.6.2002 to vacate the premises provided the petitioners file undertaking within four weeks from today. In the event, undertaking is not filed within time, this part of the order shall stand automatically vacated without reference to the Court.
Petition dismissed.
