Collector of Customs, Calcutta v Salim Abbas Bhai
Supreme Court of India

24 July 1997
C.A. No. 3108 of 1990, [Arising as an appeal from 1990 (46) E.L.T. 458 (Tribunal).]
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The point involved in this appeal is directly covered by the decision of this Court in Union of India v. Jalyan Udyog 1993 Indlaw SC 6151993 Indlaw SC 615. It is settled that the relevant date for determining value and rate of customs duty chargeable in such a case is the date of breaking up of the ship and not the date of its actual import. The view taken by the Tribunal that no duty was payable in the present case cannot, therefore, be sustained.
2.  Accordingly, this appeal is allowed. The Tribunal's order is set aside and it is held that duty is payable by the respondent on the value and rate on the date of breaking or granting of permission whichever is earlier. The concerned authority could proceed to take further steps in accordance with law for recovery of the duty payable by the respondent on this basis.
3.  The respondent will pay costs quantified at Rs. 10,000 to the appellant.
Appeal allowed.
