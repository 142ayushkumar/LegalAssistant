Patnam Shakuntala and another v Giridhar Mulji Chavda (Dead) By Lrs. and others
Supreme Court of India

8 April 2005
C.As. Nos. 2526-27 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 20074-75 of 2003) with Nos. 2528-29 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 20129-30 of 2003) and 2530-31 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 20964-65 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay in filing the counter-affidavit is condoned.
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The appeals are filed against the interim order passed in appeal by the High Court vacating the earlier order of injunction granted directing maintenance of status quo. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, in our opinion, the High Court erred in exercising the discretion in vacating the injunction already granted.
2. The result would be that third party interest would be created and the litigation will prolong. Instead it would have been appropriate for the High Court to direct the parties to maintain status quo with regard to the property in question until decision of the appeals.
3.  We direct the parties to maintain status quo i.e. they shall not alienate or create a third party interest in the property involved pending decision of the appeals by the High Court.
4.  On behalf of the respondent Puspha Chavada, the counsel appearing states that the matter has been settled inter se between the parties and no further directions are required. The statement so made is recorded.
5.  We dispose of these appeals by setting aside the impugned order of the High Court. The High Court shall dispose of the appeals in accordance with law.
Appeals disposed of.
