Nand Lal v Maya Devi and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10946/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Parties were partners in a Registered Partnership Firm M/s. Bharat Rice Mills. The partnership was dissolved on 08.02.1980. An amount of Rs.48, 298.78 was found to be due and payable to Smt. Maya Devi, the respondent No.1 by other partners of the firm. The assets and liabilities of the firm were taken over by the appellant. The amount was not paid, and therefore, she had to file a suit for the recovery of the same. The First Appellate Court directed this amount to be paid with interest 18% per annum for the pre suit period. Pendente lite interest 12% was directed to be paid on the decretal amount (which would include the principal amount as also the interest calculated 18% till the date of the suit). Further interest 6% per annum from the date of the decree i.e. 21.09.2000 till payment was also directed to be paid.
2.  Although there was a controversy as to whether Rs.45, 000/- out of the amount due and payable to the respondent No.1. was paid to her but the plea of payment has been negatived by the First Appellate Court as also by the High Court and we do not think that finding is open to question.
3.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are not inclined to dislodge the findings of fact recorded by the First Appellate Court and maintained by the High Court. We hold that the amount of Rs.48, 298.78 was due and payable by the appellant to respondent No.1 on 08.2.1980, the date of dissolution of the firm. However, the award of interest 18% per annum for the pre suit period appears to be excessive.
4. It is, therefore, directed that the amount of Rs.48, 298.78 with interest calculated 12% per annum from 08.02.1980 to the date of the decree and further interest 6% per annum on the principal amount i.e. Rs.48, 298.78 shall be paid by the appellant to respondent No.1 within a period of three months' from today. The respondent No.1 shall also be entitled to costs as awarded by the First Appellate Court. The amount so calculated up to the date of this order, shall be payable in three equal installments falling due on the 9th day of December, 2001 and January and February, 2002. In the event of any default by the appellant in payment of any of the installments, the present appeal shall be deemed to have been dismissed and the impugned decree shall stand.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
