Kempaiah (Dead) By LRs v Doddanaraiah and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 January 2000
C.A. No. 353 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the appellant as well as learned counsel for Respondents 1 to 3, who are the only contesting respondents being the plaintiffs in whose favour a decree for injunction was passed by the second appellate court.
2.  Having gone through the impugned judgment we find that the learned Judge who decided the second appeal, with respect, has not kept in view the limited jurisdiction available to him under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC).
3.  Only on this short ground and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the controversy between the parties this appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. RSA No. 794 of 1993 is restored to the file of the High Court with a request to redecide the same in accordance with law after hearing the parties, keeping in view the limited jurisdiction available to the High Court under Section 100 CPC and after following the procedure laid down therein.
No costs.
Appeal allowed.
