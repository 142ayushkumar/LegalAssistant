Jagtu v Suraj Mal and others
Supreme Court of India

5 August 2010
C.A. No. 644 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard Sh. Mahabir Singh, learned senior counsel for the appellant and Sh. B.S. Gupta, counsel for the respondents.
Application for impleadment is allowed.
2.  This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dated 22nd October, 2002 passed in Regular Second Appeal No. 4141 of 2002, which affirmed the Judgment and Order of the First Appellate Court dated 30th September, 2002 passed in Civil Appeal No. 109 of 2001 reversing the Judgment and Decree passed by the Civil Court dated 23rd November, 2001 in Civil Suit No. 423 RT of 1998/2000.
3.  Admittedly, the respondents/plaintiffs had filed the suit seeking declaration of certain rights over the suit land admitting the factual position that the land belonged to the State of Haryana. The respondents/ plaintiffs as well as the appellants/defendants were tenants in the said suit land. Before the Trial Court, the appellants/defendants had raised the preliminary objection regarding maintainability of the suit for non-joinder of parties. They had taken a stand that the suit for declaration of certain rights in the land belonging to the State of Haryana was not maintainable without impleading the State of Haryana.
4. The Trial Court framed large number of issues including the issue of maintainability of the suit for non-joinder of the necessary parties. After considering the case in totality, the Trial Court recorded the finding on the said issue that suit was not maintainable for want of necessary parties and the suit was dismissed. The First Appellate Court reversed the finding on the said issue merely observing that the respondents/ plaintiffs had not claimed any relief against the State, therefore, State was not a necessary party and decreed the suit. The High Court, while considering the Second Appeal, affirmed the Judgment and findings of the First Appellate Court and dismissed the Second Appeal preferred by the appellants/defendants.
5.  In view of the provisions of Section 79 read with Order 27, Rule 1 and in view of the provisions of the proviso contained in Order 1, Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, if any relief is claimed against the State, the State is a necessary party.
6. This view has been reiterated by this Court time and again, as is evident from the Judgments in The State of Punjab v. The Okara Grain Buyers Syndicate Ltd., Okara and Anr., 1963 Indlaw SC 307; Ranjeet Mal v. General Manager, Northern Railway, New Delhi, 1976 Indlaw SC 342; The State of Kerala v. The General Manager, Southern Railway, Madras,1976 Indlaw SC 373; Chief Conservator of Forests, Government of A.P. v. Collector and Ors.,2003 Indlaw SC 251 and The District Collector, Srikakulam and Ors.v. Bagathi Krishna Rao and Anr., 2010 Indlaw SC 426.
In view of the above, we are of the concerned opinion that as the respondents/ plaintiffs sought declaration of certain rights on the suit land belonging to the State of Haryana, the State of Haryana was a necessary party. There is a complete fallacy in the finding recorded by the First Appellate Court that the respondents/plaintiffs had not sought any relief against the State. The Appellate Court failed to appreciate that declaration in respect of certain rights over the land belonging to the State was the relief sought in the suit. Thus, in absence of the owner of the land, no such declaration could be granted. Therefore, State of Haryana was a necessary party. The suit, therefore, could not proceed for want of necessary parties.
7.  In view of the above, the appeal is allowed. The Judgment and Order of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, dated 22.10.2002 passed in RSA No. 4141/2002 and First Appellate Court dated 30.09.2002 passed in C.A. No. 109/2001 are set aside and the Judgment and Decree of the Trial Court dated 23.11.2001 passed in C.S.No. 423 RT of 1998/2000 is restored. No order as to costs.
8.  Before parting with the case, it is clarified that if the suit between the parties is pending regarding the right of pre-emption before a competent Court, this Judgment shall have no bearing on the merit of the said case.
Appeal allowed.
