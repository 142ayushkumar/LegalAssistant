Messrs Ridhi Sales Agency and Anr v Sureshbhai Jivraj Shah and Anr
Supreme Court of India

29 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13345/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the High Court should have atleast seen the record of the Trial Court before dismissing the appeal.
2.  It would be preferable in a matter like this if reasons are recorded for the decision by the High Court. We are not making any observations on the merits of the case. It will be open to the parties to raise all the contentions before the High Court.
3. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned order and remand the matter to the High Court for a fresh disposal.
The civil appeal is allowed. In the meantime, the injunction granted by the trial court will continue to operate.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
