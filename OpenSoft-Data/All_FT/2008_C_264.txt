The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case, the assessees were entitled to claim deduction under section 37 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, is the question which arose for determination before the Tribunal ?
2.  In these cases it was argued on behalf of the assessees that the aid given to the residents living in the vicinity of the factory of the assessees is a business expenditure under section 37 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 However, we do not find any finding on this aspect in the impugned judgment of the Tribunal as well as in the judgment of the High Court.
