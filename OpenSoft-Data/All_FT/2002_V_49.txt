Vineet Kumar Mathur v Union Of India And Others
Supreme Court of India

16 August 2002
Writ Petition(Civil) No.327/1990
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Application for modification of the order dated 16.1.2002 stands rejected, as in our view, it is the obligation of the State to provide the necessary land for construction of oxidation ponds and this order was passed by this Court after due deliberation.
2. It is unfortunate that the Executive Government having failed to discharge its obligation, the Court is called upon to pass such orders; and such orders when passed after hearing the State as well the other authorities, such frivolous applications are filed on one plea or the other.
3. We direct that the State Government must comply with the order as expeditiously as possible.
Application dismissed
