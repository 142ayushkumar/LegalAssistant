Harinarayan v Kaluram (Dead) By Lrs
Supreme Court of India

16 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17234/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The plaintiff-appellant filed a suit for declaration before the trial court. The said suit was decreed and the said decree was affirmed by the first appellate Court. However, the High Court in second appeal, exercising the power under Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code, set aside the judgment of the first appellate Court. It is against the said judgment the present appeal has been filed.
2.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties and looked into the record. We find that the appellant herein was not heard before the High Court. He has shown a sufficient cause before us. We, therefore, set aside the judgment under challenge and send the case back to the High Court for deciding the second appeal after giving opportunity to the appellant.
3.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
