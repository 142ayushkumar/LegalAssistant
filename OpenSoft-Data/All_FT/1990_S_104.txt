Joint Commercial Tax Officer, Madras v Smt. Pankajammal. State of Tamil Nadu v. Devar
Supreme Court of India

13 September 1990
C.A. No. 234 of 1976 with C.A. No. 1816 of 1974 and S.L.P. (Civil) Nos. 3183 and 3184 of 1975. C.A. No. 234 of 1976 is by special leave against the order Dt. 6 February 1973, of the Madras High Court in W.A. No. 161 of 1972. C.A. No. 1816 of 1974 is by special leave against the order Dt. 11 October 1972, of the Madras High Court in W.A. No. 171 of 1972
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals and the connected special leave petitions filed by the State Government and the sales tax authorities raise a common question of law whether an agreement for the exploitation of a cinematograph film for distribution and exhibition amounts to sale within the meaning of the Madras General Sales Tax Act. The High Court answered the question in favour of the assessee placing reliance on its earlier decision in A. V. Meiyappan v. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes.
2.   After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we find that the view taken by the Madras High Court by following the decision in Meiyappan's case is correct. In this view, the appeals and the special leave petitions fail and are accordingly dismissed. There will be no order as to costs. Appeals and special leave petitions dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
