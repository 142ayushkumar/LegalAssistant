Commissioner of Central Excise, Ahmedabad v Corner Stone Brands Limited
Supreme Court of India

26 February 1999
C.A. No. 1700-1701 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. There is a delay of 650 days in filing these appeals. In I.A. No. 1-2, application seeking condonation of delay, the explanation furnished reads as follows:
"2. It is submitted that there has occasioned some delay in filing the above appeal. The said delay has been caused due to the time consumed/taken in processing the steps to be taken in the matter departmentally. The details of the procedural steps, resulting in the delay, taken by the Department is detailed as below:
An apprisal of the above details would amply justifies the 'sufficient' cause for the delay, which is bonafide and genuine and deserves to be condoned. Otherwise, the Appellant/Applicant would suffer irreparable loss and injury, if the Appeal is dismissed on the ground of delay."
2. Apart from the fact that the above extracted paragraphs do not make any sense, there is no explanation at all for this inordinate delay. The application seems to have been filed very casually. The application seeking condonation of delay is dismissed.
3. Consequently, Civil Appeals are dismissed as barred by time.
Appeals dismissed
