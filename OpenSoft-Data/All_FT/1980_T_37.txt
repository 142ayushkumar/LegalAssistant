1. These appeals by certificate are directed against an order passed by the High Court of Madras disposing of three revision petitions preferred by the three respondents challenging the levy of sales tax on certain transactions of sale of matches entered into by them with buyers in the States of Karnataka and Maharashtra.
2. These transactions of sale were taxed by the sales tax authorities as inter-State sales under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (Mad) took the view that s. 8(2)(b) was violative of and was, therefore, unconstitutional and void and on this view it held that the sales effected by the respondents were taxable only at the rate of two per cent.
3.  The State of Tamil Nadu thereupon preferred the present appeals after obtaining certificate from the High Court.They only question which arises for consideration in these appeals is whether s. 8(2)(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 is unconstitutional and void as violating art. 301 of the Constitution.
4. It is no doubt true that in Sitalakshmi Mills' case (Mad) the High Court of Madras held s. 8(2)(b) to be ultra vires and void but this decision of the Madras High Court was reversed in appeal by this Court. The judgment of this Court reversing that decision is reported as State of Tamil Nadu v. Sitalakshmi Mills. This Court held in that case that s. 8(2)(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 and is valid.
5. In view of this decision, it was impossible for Mr. Francis, on behalf of the respondents, to sustain the judgment under appeal and that judgment must therefore be set aside.
6.  We accordingly allow these appeals, set aside the judgment of the Madras High Court and direct that the sales which form the subject-matter of dispute in these appeals are taxable at the rate of seven per cent under s. 8(2)(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. The State will be entitled to recover costs from the respondents. There will be only one set of hearing fee.
Appeals disposed of.
