Ram Milan v State of U.P. and others
Supreme Court of India

31 January 2003
Cr.A. No. 156 of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.P.(Cr) No. 2010 of 2002)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Despite having sent the notice again respondents 2 and 3 have refused to receive the notice which was pasted at the door of their house. Having regard to the nature of the controversy, we deem it expedient to dispose of the petition at this stage by grant of leave.
2.  An ex-parte order dated 20.3.2001 was passed by family court, Azamgarh whereby the appellant was ordered to pay maintenance of Rs.400/- to respondent no.2 and Rs.200/- to respondent no.3 p.m. from the date of the filing of the suit, i.e., 26.8.2000, on 10th of every month. He was also directed to make payment of arrears amount of maintenance.
3.  The appellant claims to be a domestic servant. On an application filed by the appellant for setting aside the ex-parte order dated 20.3.2001 and for the stay of the said order pending decision of that appeal, the family court on 26.2.2002 directed the appellant to deposit one half of the due amount, further directing that on failure to deposit, his application will be rejected without hearing. The order dated 26.2.2002 was challenged in Criminal Revision No. 393/2002 which was dismissed by the High Court by the order which is impugned in this appeal.
4.  One of the main grievances of the appellant is that he was a domestic servant employed in Ghaziabad and in connivance with the police, the respondents managed to obtain ex-parte order by showing service. None of the respondents have filed any opposition to the appeal. Having regard to facts and circumstances of case, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court as also of the family court dated 26.2.2002 and direct the family court to decide the application of the appellant wherein prayer for setting aside the ex-parte order dated 20.3.2001 has been made.
5. The application will be decided on merit without being influenced by any observation made in this order. The application is directed to be decided within a period of three months. Pending the decision of the said application there would be stay of the order dated 20.3.2001 of the family court directing payment as aforesaid. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
