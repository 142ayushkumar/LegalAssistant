S. V. Seetha Devi v State of Kerala and others
Supreme Court of India

18 August 2017
Civil Appeal No. 10617 of 2017 [@ Special Leave Petition (C) No. 20272/2017]
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. In the nature of order we propose to pass in this appeal, it is not necessary to issue notice to the respondents.
3. Though we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order, as far as the relief regarding salary for the period the appellant has worked is concerned, we are of the view that it would be just proper and equitable to pay the salary to the appellant.
4. Therefore, the judgment under challenge will stand modified to the extent that the appellant shall be entitled to the salary for the period she has actually worked, pursuant to the interim orders passed by the High Court. In case, the salary for the said period has not already been paid, the same shall be paid within a period of three months from the date of production of a copy of this order.
5. The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.
6. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
7. There shall be no orders as to costs.
Appeal disposed of
