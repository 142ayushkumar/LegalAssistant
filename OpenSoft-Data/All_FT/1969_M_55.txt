Messrs Prakash Cotton Mills Private Limited v B. Sen and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 March 1969
Dt. 1. These appeals by special leave arise out of an order of the Central Government, Dt. 16 January 1961, by which six revisional applications of the appellants were dismissed, and a similar order
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  Order had come into force on July 7, 1966, the customs authorities and the Central Government were quite right in taking the view that the rate of duty applicable to the imported goods had to be determined according to the law which was prevalent on the date they were actually removed from the warehouse, namely, the amended ss. 14 and 15 of the Act.
2.  There is therefore no force in the argument that the requirement of the amended s. 15 should have been ignored simply because the goods were imported before it came into force, or that their bills of lading or bills of entry were lodged before that date. As we find no force in these appeals, they are dismissed with costs.
Appeals dismisssed.
