Balwan Singh and Others v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

10 November 2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  It is stated in the List of dates, that the petitioners and some others similarly situated approached this Court W.P.(C) 503/92 challenging the validity of termination. But at page 20 of the Paper Book, in a representation filed by the petitioners dated 22.5.2000, it is admitted that persons other than the petitioners filed writ petition No 503/92.
2.  When the learned counsel for the petitioners was asked whether the present petitioners were parties in the earlier writ petition wherein a direction was given to treat their case for observation, learned counsel admitted that the present petitioners were not parties to W.P. No. 503/92. When a question was put as to whether the petitioners had mentioned that some others alone had filed the writ petition, learned counsel for the petitioners was not able to answer.
3. In view of what is stated in the application to the Government Secretary, Department of Education dated 22.5.2000, it, prima facie, ppears that the petitioners were not parties to the earlier writ petition. That would mean that the petitioners have come before us after 10 years.
4.  For the reason stated above, the Writ Petition is dismissed on the ground of laches.
Petition dismissed.
