C.A..No.6219-6220/2000( For Preliminary Hearing )
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the appellants. These appeals are filed against the order of framing charge in the contempt proceedings.
2. In our view, no interference is called for in these appeals at this stage as it is open to the appellants to point out at the time of hearing of the matter, if necessary by leading evidence, that no case is made out against them. Hence, these appeals are dismissed.
Appeals disposed of.
