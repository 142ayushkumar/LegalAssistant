Suresh Veerabhadrappa Kumbar v State of Karnataka and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9842/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petition stated that the matter might be disposed of at this stage by remanding the matter to the High Court for deeper consideration than has been given, as showed in the order under challenge. We have now heard learned counsel and we are satisfied that deeper consideration of the writ appeal that was before the High Court was requisite.
2. Accordingly, without expresing any opinion, lest that should prejudice the case on either side, we set aside the order under challenge and restore Writ Appeal No.582/1999 to the file of the High Court at Karnataka to be heard and disposed of afresh. Order on the appeal accordingly.
Order accordingly.
