Supreme Court of India

15 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17901/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The only question raised before us is whether grant of interest at the rate of 24% over and above 18% could be sustained in law. After some submissions learned counsel for the parties state there is possibility of some understanding on this question of rate of interest.
2. It is submitted by learned counsel for both the parties that they agree if the rate of 21.5% is fixed. Accordingly we dispose of this appeal fixing the interest at the rate of 21.5% on the basis of offer given by the learned counsel for the respondent whose client is present in court to which learned counsel for the appellant accepted to be just and proper.
3.  Accordingly, the present appeal is disposed of in terms of the aforesaid, viz., the interest chargeable would be at the rate of Rs.21.5%. Costs on the parties.
Appeal disposed of.
