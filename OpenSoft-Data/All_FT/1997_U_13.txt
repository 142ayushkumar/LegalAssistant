U.P.S.R.T.C. and Others v Har Narain Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 August 1997
Civil Appeal No. 5650 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. A disciplinary enquiry was held against the respondent who was a bus conductor in the appellant's Corporation. The Assistant Regional Manager of the appellant himself conducted the enquiry and found that the charges against the respondent are proved. He issued a show-cause notice on punishment to the respondent. After considering the reply given by the respondent, he imposed a punishment of dismissal from service on the respondent. The respondent preferred an appeal before the Regional Manager which was dismissed. The respondent then preferred a claim before the Labour Tribunal. The Labour Tribunal held that it had no jurisdiction in the matter. Thereafter, the respondent preferred a petition before the U. P. Public Services Tribunal at Lucknow. The Tribunal dismissed the respondents petition and held that there is no illegality in the conduct of the enquiry. It also held that the reasons given by the enquiry officer cannot be said to be perverse or against merit on record. From this judgment and order of the Tribunal dated 11.10.1985, the respondent filed a writ petition before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. A single Judge of the High Court reappreciated the evidence led in the enquiry and quashed the order passed by the Tribunal as also the order passed by the Disciplinary Authority.
The High Court clearly exceeded its jurisdiction in doing so because the High Court was not sitting in appeal over the findings given by the disciplinary authority. The reexamination of the evidence led in the disciplinary proceedings was not warranted. The impugned judgment and order of the High Court are, therefore, set aside and the order of the Tribunal is restored. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed
