Md. Akhtar Hussain v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 November 1987
C.A. No. 5076/85,
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. The appellant was removed from service on 17th March 1983 during the pendency of Reference No. 27/1982 before the Industrial Tribunal, Patna. We are satisfied that the foundation for the removal of the appellant from the service in this case is the alleged acts of misconduct said to have been committed by him. No inquiry had been held into the acts of misconduct attributed to him before discharging the appellant from the service and the approval of the Tribunal had not been taken. It is therefore clear that management in this case had contravened Section33 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and has exposed itself for action under Section33A of the said Act. The Labour Court was in error in the facts and circumstances of the case in holding that Section 33 had not been contravened.
2.   We, therefore, set aside the judgment of the High Court and the award passed by the Labour Court and direct that the appellant shall be reinstated in service in the post which he was holding before his service were terminated. He shall also be entitled to 50% of his backwages from the date of termination of service upto the date of his reinstatement. He shall be reinstate within two weeks. The backwages shall be paid within four weeks.
The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
