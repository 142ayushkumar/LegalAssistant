1.  In the light of the decision of this Court in counsel on both sides agree that the appellant comes within the definition of 'industry.'
2. The appeals, on this point, therefore, fail. The consequence is that the Industrial Tribunal has to take up the proceedings and continue to adjudicate on the dispute and give its award. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
