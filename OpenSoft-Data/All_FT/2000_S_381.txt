Sanjay Kumar Sinha v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13727/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  It is an admitted position before this court that a copy of the report was not given to the appellant but his advocates were allowed to read it in court.
We do not think that that is conducive to the interests of justice. We think that it is appropriate, in the circumstances, without saying more lest it should prejudice the case on either side, to set aside the order under challenge (on the writ appeal) and the order on the writ petition and to remand the writ petition to the High Court for being heard and disposed of afresh on merits.
2.  A copy of the report is annexed to the counter affidavit of the respondents in this court. It shall be open to the appellant to apply, if so advised, for leave to amend the writ petition in that behalf, and the application shall be considered on its merits.
3. The civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal and the order on the writ petition (C.W.J.C. No.11113 of 1997) are set aside and the writ petition is remanded to the High Court for being heard and disposed of afresh. This shall be done expeditiously. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
