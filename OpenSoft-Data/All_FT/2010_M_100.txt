Supreme Court of India

15 January 2010
CIVIL APPEAL NO.301 OF 2010(Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.3654 of 2009)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
None appears for the respondent, though served.
1.  The impugned order, as usual, is a cryptic order.

Hence, the impugned order is set aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court for de novo consideration in the light of the decision of this Court, if applicable, in the case of Bajaj Electricals Limited 2008 Indlaw SC 1921 [supra].
2.  The civil appeal is, accordingly, allowed with no order as to costs.
Appeal Allowed
