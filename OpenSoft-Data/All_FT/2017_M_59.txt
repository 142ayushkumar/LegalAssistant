MCI once again directed the college to send its compliance.
The Oversight Committee approved conditional recognition for the college on 29 August 2016. This was subject to the following conditions :
"(i) An undertaking on affidavit from the Dean/Principal and the Chairman of the Trust affirming that the deficiencies pointed out by the assessors of the Council in the compliance verification assessment stands rectified;
(ii) A Bank Guarantee for a sum of Rs. 2 crores in favour of the Council which shall be valid for a period of one year or till such time the first renewal inspection takes place, whichever is later.
It was further directed that the inspection of the medical colleges which have been recommended for grant of Conditional Letter of Permission / Recognition by the then Oversight Committee shall be conducted after 30 September 2016 and any college which is found to have not complied / rectified the deficiency as per their undertaking shall be debarred from admitting any students for a period of 2 years i.e. 2017-18 & 2018-19."
Following this, the Union government issued conditional recognition on 12 September 2016.

The Executive Committee considered the assessment report dated 21 February 2017 in its meeting held on 21 March 2017.
After deliberation, it was decided to recommend to the Central Government not to approve the conditional recognition granted to the college by the Oversight Committee. It was further decided to invoke Regulation 8(3)(1)(c) of the MCI Establishment of Medical College Regulations, 1999. Regulation 8(3) (1)(c) stipulates that if in any medical college which is at the stage of recognition under Section 11(2) of the IMC Act, 1956 it is noticed that the deficiency of faculty is more than 10% and/or bed occupancy is less than 70%, such an institute will not be permitted to admit students in that academic year. The said Regulation also provides that if the afore-mentioned deficiencies are noticed in the college MCI will issue a notice calling upon the college to show cause as to why the recognition granted to the college be not withdrawn. The relevant portion of Regulation 8(3)(1)(c) is reproduced hereinbelow :
"(c) Colleges which are already recognized for award of M.B.B.S degree and /or running Postgraduate courses.
If it is observed during any inspection / assessment of the institute that the deficiency of teaching faculty and /or Residents is more than 10% and / or bed occupancy is less than 70%, compliance of rectification of deficiency from such an institute will not be considered for issue of renewal of permission in that processing application for Postgraduate courses in that Academic Year and will be issued show cause notices as to why the recommendations for withdrawal of recognition of the courses run by that institute should not be made for undergraduate and postgraduate courses which are recognized under Section 11(2) of the IMC Act, 1956 along with direction of stoppage of admissions in permitted postgraduate courses."
By a letter dated 24 March 2017, MCI recommended that the college should, in view of the deficiencies, be debarred from admitting students for 2017-18 and that the bank guarantee furnished by the petitioner be encashed. An opportunity of being heard was thereafter furnished by the Hearing Committee constituted by the Union government, which affirmed the decision of the MCI on 31 May 2017.
6. On 11 August 2017, this Court, while entertaining the writ petition filed by the college, directed the Union government to afford a hearing and to issue a fresh order. Following the above directions, a hearing was granted to the college on 24 August 2017 and an order was issued on 30 August 2017 affirming the earlier decision. The order passed by the Union government notes that the representative of the Oversight Committee could not attend the meeting of the Hearing Committee.
7. The petitioner has urged that the college has received the recommendations of MCI and permissions of the Union government since 2011-12 and, until date, four batches have been admitted. For academic session 2015-16, permission was denied to the college on 15 June 2015. For 2016-17 the college, despite the grant of conditional recognition under Section 11(2), was unable to admit students since no students were supplied by the third respondent (Director General, Medical Education, State of U P). In consequence, the college does not presently have students for the first and second year of the MBBS degree course.
8. The petitioner submitted that for compliance verification, the college was inspected on 21 February 2017. The petitioner has adverted to the fact that the assessment report dated 21 February 2017 is relevant since in the impugned order dated 30 August 2017, it has been stated that no dissent note on the assessors' report was given by the college. The grievance of the petitioner is that it had explained the alleged deficiencies together with supporting documents which has not been considered. For example, it has been submitted that the faculty could not present itself on 21 February 2017 "because of the short time and some faculty were on leave and some faculty were not counted". According to the petitioner, since no students were admitted for the first two academic years of the MBBS course at the relevant time, the faculty of seven departments was idle with no work of teaching. According to the assessment report, 34 out of 113 members of the faculty were not available though the petitioner has submitted details about them. The petitioner points out that where as at one stage the deficiency of faculty is recorded at 72.4%, at another stage, it is recorded at 84.76%.
9. Following the receipt of MCI's letter dated 24 March 2017, the Union government directed the petitioner by its letter dated 5 April 2017 to appear for a hearing on 11 April 2017. The petitioner has submitted that it appeared before the Hearing Committee and submitted its objections but a non-speaking order was issued. Pursuant to the directions issued on 11 August 2017 by this Court, the petitioner appeared before the Hearing Committee on 24 August 2017 and submitted its objections on the report of MCI dated 21 February 2017. According to the petitioner, it has a total faculty of 113 of which 44 are teachers for the first and second years of the MBBS course. The petitioner has submitted that 44 members of the faculty have no work of teaching, in the absence of students. According to it, it has submitted a list of faculty including Form 16 showing the TDS certificates evidencing the engagement of faculty in the college. A similar explanation has, according to the petitioner, been submitted in relation to residents. The grievance of the petitioner is that the impugned order dated 30 August 2017 is a non-speaking order.
It has been urged that the annexures of the order would indicate that the submissions which were urged were rejected only on the ground that no dissent note was furnished to the report of the assessors. The petitioner urges that there was no occasion to record any dissent note in the report dated 21 February 2017 and this was possible only after receipt of the letter of the Union government dated 5 April 2017 which was complied with on 9 April 2017. These submissions have been urged to buttress the contention that the impugned orders dated 31 May 2017 and 30 August 2017 have been passed in a mechanical manner.
10. Having considered the submissions which have been urged on behalf of the petitioner, we are of the view that the explanation which has been submitted by the petitioner in regard to the availability of faculty and other infrastructure raises purely factual issues. In the very nature of things, this is a matter which requires verification by MCI as an expert statutory body. The availability of faculty and their presence on the date of inspection is a matter for factual determination and cannot be re-appreciated by the court. The petitioner has stated that it has not admitted any student for two consecutive academic years as a result of which it has no students for the first and second years of the MBBS degree course. The impugned orders have to be read as a composite whole and the ultimate conclusion cannot be read torn out of the context set out in the entirety of the factual background noticed in the determination. The orders passed by the Union government in the present regard cannot be construed in the same manner as orders passed by a court in a judicial proceeding.
The court cannot overlook the fact that in the assessment reports of March and April 2016 and July 2016, serious deficiencies have been noted in the availability of faculty and residents and in regard to bed occupancy. These deficiencies, have been observed to have continued in the assessment report dated 21 February 2017. In the very nature of things, it would not be appropriate for this Court to reappraise the factual situation for itself, particularly in the absence of any cogent material evidencing that the deficiencies have been rectified. However, it would be in the fairness of things to permit the petitioner to have an opportunity to establish before the MCI that all the deficiencies have been duly rectified by the petitioner. This exercise, however, shall enure only for academic year 2018-19 and not prior thereto. The cut-off date for admissions to the MBBS degree course for 2017-18 has already elapsed following which the academic session has commenced.
11. We accordingly direct that :
(i) The case of the petitioner shall be duly considered by MCI and by the Union government in accordance with the prevalent regulations for academic year 2018-19.
(ii) The bank guarantee which was furnished by the petitioner shall be kept live in the meantime and shall not be encashed.
(iii) MCI shall conduct a fresh inspection as per the Regulations within a period of two months. It shall apprise the petitioner-institution with regard to the deficiencies and afford an opportunity to rectify the same and, thereafter, proceed to act as contemplated under the Act.
(iv) After MCI sends its recommendation to the Central government, it shall take a final decision according to law after affording an opportunity of a hearing to the petitioners. MCI shall take the assistance of the Hearing Committee constituted by the Constitution Bench decision in Amma Chandravati Educational and Charitable Trust and Others v Union of India and another Writ Petition (Civil) No 408 of 2017 or other directions given in the said decision.
12. Having regard to the interest of medical education and the observations contained in the judgment delivered today by this Court in Writ Petition (c) No 674 of 2017 in Madha Medical College and Research Institute through its Managing Director v Union of India, we decline to grant any relief in respect of academic year 2017-18 to the petitioner.
13. The petition shall accordingly stand disposed of in these terms.
