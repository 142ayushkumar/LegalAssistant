Vasudev Dani v Purushottam Das Khandelwal and another
Supreme Court of India

17 December 2004
Cr.As. No. 1515 of 2004 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 3085 of 2004) with No. 1518 of 2004 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 3311 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court has passed the impugned order, rejecting the petitions of the appellant made under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (for short "CrPC"). In the impugned order, it is stated thus:
"After having carefully gone through the material on record and the facts and circumstances, I find no ground for any further interference of this Court more so in view of the fact that the petition under Section 482 CrPC filed by other co-accused against the same order has already been dismissed by this Court vide order dated 31-3-2003 with the directions for expediting the trial. The miscellaneous petitions are dismissed accordingly as having no merit."
2.  As is evident from what is extracted above from the impugned order, the High Court did not consider the case of the appellant on merits. The petitions filed by the appellant under Section 482 CrPC were dismissed merely on the ground that the petition filed by the co-accused against the same order had been dismissed.
3.  In our view, it is just and appropriate that the High Court disposes of the petitions filed by the appellant under Section 482 CrPC on its own merits, after hearing both the parties. All the contentions of the parties are left open to be urged before the High Court, including the maintainability of the petition itself.
The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
