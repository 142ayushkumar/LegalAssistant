1. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
2. Leave granted.
3. Upon perusal of the impugned judgment, it appears that the possession of the land in question was with the owners of the land in question in 2002-2003. Whereas, as per the respondents the possession was taken over in the year 1995-1996. There appears to be some doubt, which was not examined by the High Court.
4. Therefore, we set aside the impugned orders and remand the matters to the High Court so that it can be decided afresh after hearing the parties.
5. The appeals are disposed of as allowed with no order as to costs.
