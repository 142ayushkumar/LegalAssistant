Suresh Kumar Malhotra v Rajni Kumar
Supreme Court of India

9  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6616/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Upon hearing submission made by the petitioner-in-person in support of the petition we do not see any reason to interfere with the proceedings at this stage. The High Court passed an ad-interim order on 12.1.2001 fixing the matter on 19.1.2001 though with an order of stay.
2.  The petitioner-in-person moves this court against such an order. The petition in our view is not maintainable as noticed above. The petition thus fails and is dismissed.
3. The petitioner however would be at liberty to take steps in accordance with law for early disposal of the matter before the High Court.
Petition dismissed.
