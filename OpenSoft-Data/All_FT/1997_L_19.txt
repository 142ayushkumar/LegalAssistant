Collector of Customs, Bombay v Law Publishers, Allahabad
Supreme Court of India

30 April 1997
C.A. No. 3177 of 1990
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  This is an appeal by Collector of Customs against an order of the Tribunal where it has been held that the product imported by the respondents is classifiable under Heading 32.13 of the First Schedule to the Indian Customs Tarriff Act, 1975.
2. The imported product is Thermographic Printing Powder. The Tribunal held that:
"though it may not be a conventional printing ink it is akin to printing ink and Heading 32.13 which is not limited to 'writing ink and printing ink' but covers also 'other inks' would, in our view, be more specific and therefore, more appropriate than heading 32.04/12(1)."
3.  We are in agreement with the view expressed by the Tribunal. The appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
