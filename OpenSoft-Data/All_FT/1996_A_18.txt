Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Company and Another v A. V. Joshi
Supreme Court of India

13 February 1996
C.A. No. 1044 of 1979 with S.L.P. (C) No. 13353 of 1992
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In the present case, the High Court has not followed the direct decision of this Court on Section 80-K of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in Union of India v. Coromandel Fertilizers Ltd. 1975 Indlaw SC 3611975 Indlaw SC 3611975 Indlaw SC 361 which is by a Bench of two learned Judges. The High Court has referred to two later decisions of this Court in CIT v. Patiala Flour Mills Co. (P) Ltd. 1978 Indlaw SC 5141978 Indlaw SC 5141978 Indlaw SC 514 and Rajapalayam Mills Ltd. v. CIT 1978 Indlaw SC 2181978 Indlaw SC 2181978 Indlaw SC 218 by a Bench of three learned Judges on Section 80-J of the Act.
2.   The latter decisions by a Bench of three Judges on Section 80-J do not say that the decision in Union of India v. Coromandel Fertilizers Ltd. 1975 Indlaw SC 3611975 Indlaw SC 3611975 Indlaw SC 361 is not correct. In such a situation, it was inappropriate for the High Court to have itself treated the decision in Union of India v. Coromandel Fertilizers Ltd. 1975 Indlaw SC 3611975 Indlaw SC 3611975 Indlaw SC 361 as incorrect when that is the decision directly on Section 80-K of the Act.
However, in these circumstances, we consider it appropriate that these matters be heard by a three-Judge Bench.
List the matters before a three-Judge Bench.
Order accordingly.
