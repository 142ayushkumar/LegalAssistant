Muzaffar Nagar-Bud.Motor Operators'Union v Government of U.P. and Others
Supreme Court of India

29 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14471/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petitions stated that the matters might be disposed of at this stage in the light of the judgment of this Court in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Devi Dayal Singh.
2.  Learned counsel for the respondents fairly states that the issue in these appeals is so covered. Accordingly, the civil appeals will have to be allowed in terms of the order of this court in the aforesaid judgment.
3.  It is submitted that there is a claim for refund in these matters and that there was no claim for refund in the case decided by this court earlier. Even so, we do not think that, in the circumstances, it will be appropriate to grant the refund.
4.  The civil appeals are allowed. The impugned orders of the High Court are set aside. There shall be a declaration in terms of paragraph (26) of the judgment of this Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Devi Dayal Singh.
No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
