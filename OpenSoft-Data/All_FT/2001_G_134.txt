Govindaswami Padayachi v Gopal Padayachi (D) By Lrs. and Anr
Supreme Court of India

23 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9391/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  It is not disputed that respondent No. 2 herein died during pendency of Second Appeal No. 798/83.
2.  Consequently, in the absence of substitution of the deceased respondent, the appeal before the High Court abated. We, therefore, set aside the judgment under appeal and send the matter back to the High Court for disposal of the Second Appeal in accordance with law.
3.  However, it will be open to the parties to take steps for substitution, and if such step is taken, it would be considered in accordance with law. The status quo existing today shall continue during pendency of the Second Appeal before the High Court.
4.  With the aforesaid directions, the appeal is disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
