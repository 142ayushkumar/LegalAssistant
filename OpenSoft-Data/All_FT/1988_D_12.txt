Surinder Grover v Delhi Administration
Supreme Court of India

10 March 1988
Cr.A. No. 433 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  No one appears for the appellant though called for Shri G. D. Gupta learned counsel for the respondent Delhi Administration is present Arguments heard.
2.  We recall the courts order dated September 6, 1984 in SLP (Cri) No. 1720 of 1984 granting leave to appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, 1950 on the ground of suppression of material facts. The appellant had concealed the fact that he had earlier moved this Court in SLP No. 1608 of 1983 under the name Surinder Kumar and that the court had dismissed the same after hearing on September 23, 1983. Undeterred he again moved this Court by the present petition under Article 136 under the name of Surinder Grover and also suppressed the fact of dismissal of the earlier petition.
3.   It is quite evident that the court was misled in granting special leave.
4.  We accordingly recall the earlier order dated September 6, 1984 granting leave to appeal as also the order dated October 16, 1984 directing the release of the appellant on bail.
5.  We are given to understand by the learned counsel for the respondent that the appellant has been evading the execution of the warrant for his arrest ordered earlier.
6.  Special leave petition is dismissed accordingly. We direct that the appellant be taken into custody forthwith to serve out his sentence.
Petition dismissed.
