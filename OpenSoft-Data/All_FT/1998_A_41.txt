State of W. B. and Others v Ajoy Kumar Banerjee
Supreme Court of India

27 August 1998
C.A. No. 12796 of 1996 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 3 September 1993 of the Calcutta High Court in F.M.A.T. No. 3441 of 1990)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  The learned counsel for the State of West Bengal wanted to raise some important questions of law in this appeal: but in view of the fact that there is only one post of Protocol Officer in the High Court and the additional financial burden likely to fall upon the State Government will be insignificant, we do not think it proper to decide those questions in this appeal.
We therefore dismiss this appeal.
