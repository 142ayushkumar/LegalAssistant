Commissioner of Sales Tax, New Delhi v Delhi Transport Corporation, New Delhi
Supreme Court of India

13 December 2001
C.A. No. 2622 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In the case of State of A.P. v. APSRTC 2000 Indlaw SC 3678 there was a dispute similar to one as is in the present case. This Court in its order dated 9-2-2000 in APSRTC case 2000 Indlaw SC 3678 (supra) declined to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution because the respondent Corporation therein belonged to the State of Andhra Pradesh.
2.  In the present case also, Delhi Transport Corporation is an organ of the Delhi Government and leaving the question of law open, we see no reason as to why we should waste the Court's time in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution.
The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
