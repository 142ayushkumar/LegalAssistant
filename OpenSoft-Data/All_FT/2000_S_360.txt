Leave granted.
1.  We are not deciding the question as to the title of the vehicle in dispute nor the correctness of the rival, versions regarding the transactions relating to the vehicle.

(b) The appellant shall execute a bond in a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs with two solvent sureties that he will produce the vehicle back in Court whenever required by the Court.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.
