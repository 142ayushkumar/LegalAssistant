State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr v Mahendra Pal
Supreme Court of India

23 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.2080/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  A learned Single Judge of Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench having stayed the operation of an order of suspension, while the Writ Petition is pending, the State of Uttar Pradesh has come in appeal. An employer would be well within his jurisdiction to suspend an employee pending consideration of disciplinary charges against the employee.
2.  At that stage, the Court would not be justified in staying the order of suspension unless prima facie the Court is satisfied that the order had been passed malafide or that the order in question had been passed not by the competent authority. But by no stretch of imagination, while the Writ Petition itself is pending assailing the legality of the order in question, the High Court could have stayed the said order of suspension, as has been done in the present case.
3.  We therefore set aside the impugned order of the High Court dated 1.6.2000 and direct that the Writ Petition itself may be disposed of at an early date.
The Special Leave Petition stands disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
