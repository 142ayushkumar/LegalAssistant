Arjun Das v Rampyari and others
Supreme Court of India

24 February 1999
S.L.P. (C) No. 2407 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner states that there are three options under the law for punishing a man who has violated the law as here. He also submits that the punishment is harsh because the petitioner is 71 years old. He submits that a token punishment should be awarded.
2.  Firstly, 20 years have elapsed before the petitioner took steps in appeal and although there was no stay he did not comply with the order.
3. Secondly, if he is in breach he must be punished regardless of his age. Thirdly, there is no reason why we should exercise our discretion in favour of such a man to impose anything less than the punishment which has been imposed.
The SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
