State Of Kerala v Chakok Varghese Plathuruthu
Supreme Court of India

31 October 2002
C.A. No.11154 Of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The above appeal has been filed by the State of Kerala against the judgment of a Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam dated 18.01.1988 in L.A.A.No.149 of 1980 whereunder the High Court, while disposing of the appeal filed by the State challenging the quantum of compensation awarded by the reference court, sustained the claim of the land owners made by filing C.M.P. No.554 of 1987 seeking the benefits of the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, as amended by the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984. The High Court appears to have proceeded on its own interpretation of the scope of the amendments introduced. Though notice has been ordered and served, the respondents have not chosen to enter appearance to defendthe proceedings.
2. On hearing the learned counsel for the appellant, we are of the view that the question involved in this appeal is no longer res-integra and is covered by a judgment of the Constitution Bench of this Court (K.S. Paripoornan Vs.State of Kerala & Ors.) against the land owners and in favour of the State.
3.  Having regard to the undisputable fact that the award in this case was passed on 21.05.1970 and that even the reference court has disposed of the claims in the year 1979 as could be seen from the fact that the appeal before the Kerala High Court itself is of the year 1980, it is obvious that the relevant decisions which only is the criteria for the applicability or otherwise of the Amendment Act have been arrived at long before 30.04.1982.
4. Consequently, in the light of the Constitution Bench judgment noticed above, the respondent-land owner will not be entitled to the benefit of enhanced rate of solatium under Section 23(2) or the rate of interest as provided under Section 23(1-A) or enhanced rate of interest under Section 28 of the Act.
5. The judgment of the Kerala High Court in so far as it has countenanced claims under the above provisions at the instance of the land owners is set aside and the appeal is, accordingly, allowed. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
