The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties we find it necessary to remit the appeal to the High Court so far as appellant Ram Karan is concerned for a decision afresh after hearing the parties on merits.

"so far as appellant Ram Karan is concerned, there is sufficient evidence oral or otherwise to connect him with the brutal murder committed in this incident."
2.   Accordingly, the appeal succeeds and is allowed, the judgment and sentence passed by the High Court dismissing the appeal of the appellant Ram Karan are set aside. The case is accordingly remanded to the High Court for a fresh decision in accordance with law.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
