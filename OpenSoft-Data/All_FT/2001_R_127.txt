Rajinder Singh v Union Territory Chandigarh and Others
Supreme Court of India

29 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6032/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner urged that the rate at which the compounding fee is being demanded by the Chandigarh Administration from the petitioner is wholly unjust, excessive, unreasonable, illegal and contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court.
2.  This argument of the petitioner does not arise out of the order of the High Court under challenge as the substantive order of the High Court was either to remove the violation of the building bye-laws or get the violation compounded by the Administration. The petitioner thereafter moved an application for extension of time to deposit the balance compounding fee which was allowed.
3. In that view of the matter, we are not inclined to interfere with the matter. The Special Leave Petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
