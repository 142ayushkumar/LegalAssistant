Land Acquisition Officer, Punjab v Anudeep Kaur and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 December 1995
Civil Appeal Nos. 11859-60 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  The controversy is no longer res integra as regards entitlement to payment of additional amount under Section 23 (1-A) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, as amended by Act 68 of 1984. The award of the Land Acqusiition Officer is dated July 30, 1981. Therefore, Section 23 (1-A) has no application to the award in question. Under these circumstances, the Civil court has no jurisdiction to amend the award and decree awarding additional amount under Section 23 (1-A). The High Court equally committed an error of law in dismissing the civil revision in that behalf.
The appeals are accordingly allowed to the above extent. No costs
