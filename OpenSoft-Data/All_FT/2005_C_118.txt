Colvin School Society And Ors v Anil Kumar Sharma And Ors.
Supreme Court of India

14 March 2005
Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No(s).24981/2004
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Issue fresh notice to the unserved respondents. Dasti service, in addition, is permitted.
2. On behalf of the petitioner-Management, with reference to the order dated 17th December, 2004, it is submitted that the teachers have been directed to teach ISCE course but, instead of so doing, they are disturbing the conduct of classes and continue to sit outside the room of the principal and others. It is seriously disputed by learned counsel representing teachers. By order dated 17th December, 2004, the order of status quo in regard to the services of the teachers was continued in terms of directions contained in the impugned judgment, subject to the condition that the teachers would teach their courses as directed by the petitioner-Management.
If the teachers, in violation of that order, decline to teach the courses as directed by the Management, they would do so at their own peril. It has been submitted on behalf of the teachers that without any reservation, they are prepared to teach ISCE course. In order to obviate any dispute at a later stage, let the Management supply to the advocate on record appearing for the teachers the details of the course required to be taught by the teachers and the time table. Counter affidavit be filed within four weeks and rejoinder within four weeks thereafter.
3. Reply to the I.As. be also filed within four weeks. List after service is complete.
Order accordingly
