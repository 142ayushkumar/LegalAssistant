The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that no interim order should have been passed either by the Tribunal or affirmed by the High Court. The appropriate procedure would be that the Tribunal should dispose of the matter at an early date.
2.  We record the statement on behalf of the appellants that in case the respondent succeeds, he would be given backwages and would be fully compensated. The appeal stands disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Appeal disposed of.
