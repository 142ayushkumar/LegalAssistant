Satish Chander Gupta and Sons v Klick Nixon Limited and Another
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2009
Civil Appeal No. 6151 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal has been filed against the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission [for short, "the National Commission"] dated 13th April, 2000. The said impugned order reads as follows:
"We have gone through the merits of the case. We agree with the view expressed by the State Commission. The Revision Petition is dismissed."
2.  A perusal of the above order shows that no reasons have been given therein. In our opinion, even in an order of affirmance, some reasons ought to be recorded, which need not be as elaborate as orders passed by the District Forum or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. Hence, we set aside the impugned order and remand the matter to the National Commission for decision afresh after hearing the parties in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible.
The civil appeal is, accordingly, allowed.
Appeal allowed
