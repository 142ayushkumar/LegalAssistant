Union of India v Arviva Industries (I) Limited
Supreme Court of India

10 January 2007
C.A. No. 169 of 2007 With T.C. (C) No. 51 of 2006, Tc Nos. 52-56 of 2006, 58-74 of 2006, 76-79 of 2006 and C.A. No. 170 of 2007 @ S.L.P. (C) Nos. 2126 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Leave granted in the special leave petitions.
2.We agree with the view taken by the High Court that the Circulars issued by the Central Board of Excise and Customs are binding on the department and the department cannot be permitted to urge that the Circulars issued by the Board are not binding on it.
3. This Court in a series of decisions has held that Circulars issued u/s. 119 of the Income tax Act, 1961 and Section 37B of the Central Excise Act, 1944 are binding on the revenue. Navnit Lal C. Jhaveri v. K.K. Sen, 1964 Indlaw SC 212 ; Ellerman Lines Ltd. v. CIT, 1971 Indlaw SC 447; K.P.Varghese v. ITO, 1981 Indlaw SC 334; Union of India v. Azadi Bachao Andolan, 2003 Indlaw SC 823,; CCE v. Usha Martin Industries; Ranadey Micronutrients v. CCE, 1996 Indlaw SC 821; CCE v. Jayant Dalai (P) Ltd., 1996 Indlaw SC 3898; CCE v. Kores (India) Ltd., 1996 Indlaw SC 3703; Paper Products Ltd. v. CCE, 1999 Indlaw SC 103 and Dabur India Ltd v. CCE, 2003 Indlaw SC 1118.
4. A slightly different approach was taken by this Court in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. v. CIT, 2000 Indlaw SC 516 by two learned Judges which runs counter to the decisions, referred to above. The view taken in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (supra) being contrary to the subsequent decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in CCE v. Dhiren Chemical Industries (I), 2002 Indlaw SC 1351 cannot be taken to be good law.
5. This Court in Commissioner of Customs, Calcutta and  Others v. Indian Oil Corporation Limited  and Another, 2004 Indlaw SC 158, after examining the entire case law, culled out the following principles:
"1. Although a circular is not binding on a court or an assessee, it is not open to the Revenue to raise a contention that is contrary to a binding circular by the Board. When a circular remains in operation, the Revenue is bound by it and cannot be allowed to plead that it is not valid nor that it Is contrary to the terms of the statute.
2. Despite the decision of this Court, the Department cannot be permitted to take a stand contrary to the instructions issued by the Board.
3. A show-cause notice and demand contrary to the existing circulars of the Board are ab initio bad.
4. It Is not open to the Revenue to advance an argument or file an appeal contrary to the circulars."
6. In this particular case, the Board's Circular No. 39/99-Cus., dated 25th June, 1999 extends the benefit of Brand Rate of Drawback to compensate exporters for the re-rolled steel products and processed fabrics.
The High Court has rightly come to the conclusion that the circulars issued by the Board are binding on the department. An effort was made by the learned Solicitor General to get this case referred to a larger Bench. We do not accept this contention in view of number of decisions and especially the Constitution Bench decision in Dhiren Chemical Industries (I) (supra).
7. The Civil Appeals are dismissed. No costs.
T.C. (C) No. 51 of 2006, TC Nos. 52-56/2006, 58-74/2006, 76-79/2006
All these transferred cases are sent back to the respective High Courts for being decided afresh in view of the law laid down by us today in Civil Appeal arising out of special leave petitions nos. 3480-3483/2005, as expeditiously as possible.
Appeals disposed of.
