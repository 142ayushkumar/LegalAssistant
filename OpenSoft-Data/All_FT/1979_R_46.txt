Ranchhod v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

24 January 1979
Cr.A. No. 287 of 1973
The Judgment was delivered by: FAZAL ALI, J.
1. The appellant in this appeal by special leave has been convicted under S. 365 I.P.C. and sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 100/-. He has also been convicted under S. 457 I.P.C. and sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100/-. The sentences were directed to run concurrently.
2.  We have gone through the judgment of the High Court and that of the Trial Court and we do not find any point in this case so as to warrant our interference. Mr. Kohli for the appellant argued that having regard to the circumstance that the appellant was not the main culprit who demanded ransom, a lenient view of the matter be taken.
3. It would, however, appear from the evidence of P. W. 1 that the appellant took an active part in abducting and torturing the complainant and also demanded ransom like his confederates. We do not find any ground to reduce the sentence in this case. There is merit in this appeal and it is dismissed. The appellant shall now surrender and serve out the remaining portion of the sentence.
Appeal dismissed.
