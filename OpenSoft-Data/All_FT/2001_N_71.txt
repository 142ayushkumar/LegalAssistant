Supreme Court of India

19 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)..... CC 1019/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
Delay is condoned.
1.  After hearing the learned counsel quite at length, we are unable to find any incorrect statement of fact recorded by the High Court when it dismissed the Second Appeal by passing the following order:
"Both the courts below have held that the nature of property is Kabristan from time immemorial and the appellants have no right or title in the property. This being the finding of fact, no case for interference in second appeal is made out.Dismissed."
2. We have perused the order of the trial Court as well as of the First Appellate Court. In our view, the High Court is justified in not interfering in the second appeal. The Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
