N. N. Bhagwati v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

20 July 2000
C.A. No. 4665 of 1996 (Arising as an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 3 February 1993, of the Bombay High Court in I.T.R. No. 510 of 1978).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not impressed by the submission on behalf of the appellant that the judgment of this court in the case of H. H. Sir Rama Varma v. CIT 1993 Indlaw SC 1572, needs reconsideration by a larger Bench. That judgment notes that sections 80AA and 80AB of the Income-tax Act, 1961, were introduced at one and the same point of time and that section 80AA was given retrospective operation with effect from April 1, 1968.
2. It notes that it was held in the case of Distributors (Baroda) P. Ltd. v. Union of India 1985 Indlaw SC 405 , that section 80AA was declaratory of the law as it always had been since April 1, 1968. On a parity of reasoning, it was held in the judgment in H. H. Sir Rama Varma 1993 Indlaw SC 1572  that section 80AB was also enacted to declare the law as it always stood. Whether, therefore, the circulars of the Board have stated that section 80AB was prospective is of no relevance and the judgment cannot be reconsidered on that ground.
3.  The appeal is covered against the appellant by the judgment in the case of H. H. Sir Rama Varma 1993 Indlaw SC 1572The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
