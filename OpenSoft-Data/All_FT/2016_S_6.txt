"........
Having heard the learned counsel for both the sides for quite some time, we are of the opinion that the order passed by the respondent-State, which gave rise to the contempt dated 12.09.2014, is not in due compliance of the Judgment of this Court dated 07.02.2013 in SLP (C) 19016 of 2008.

3. The learned counsel for the State has produced a copy of the order passed by the Government on 06.05.2016 in compliance of our order dated 04.04.2016.
4. Therefore, this appeal is disposed of, directing the respondent to distribute the benefits flowing out of the order dated 06.05.2016 along with arrears to the appellants within a period of six weeks from today.
