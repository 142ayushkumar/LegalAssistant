Appropriate Authority of Income Tax v Jagdish Electricians India P. Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

28 August 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court in a proceeding that arose under Chapter XX-C of the Income-tax Act, 1961, for compulsory purchase of certain immovable property on being challenged held  1999 Indlaw MUM 353  that the show cause notice issued was too vague and did not disclose the reasons thereof nor the material considered by the appropriate authority in reaching a tentative conclusion was disclosed and, therefore, the whole proceedings stood vitiated and thereby quashed the said notice.
2. In doing so, the High Court adverted to the decision in  Gautam v. Union of India 1992 Indlaw SC 1163 and also other two decisions in Writ Petition No. 1918 of 1993, Shreyas Builders v. M. D. Kodnani and Writ Petition No. 2818 of 1994, Laxman Ganesh Tulshi-baughwala v. M. D. Kodnani 1999 Indlaw MUM 358 and followed the same. The latter two matters had been brought up before this court and special leave petitions stood dismissed.
3.  In that view of the matter, we do not find any merit in these appeals and the same stand dismissed accordingly.
Appeals dismissed.
