Union of India and Others v Swaran Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 March 1996
C.As. Nos. ... of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) Nos. 2369-79 of 1994)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Delay condoned.
2. Leave granted. We have heard learned counsel on both sides.
3. The only question is : whether the respondents are entitled to the payment of solatium and interest under the provisions of Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952. The controversy is no longer res integra. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Union of India v. Hari Krishan Khosla 1992 Indlaw SC 605 had considered the entire controversy and had held that the respondents were not entitled to the payment of interest and solatium. The learned counsel for the respondents sought to place reliance upon a two-Judge Bench decision in Rao Narain Singh v. Union of India  1993 Indlaw SC 1321. In view of the decision in Hari Krishan Khosla case 1993 Indlaw SC 1321 the ratio of Rao Narain Singh case is no longer good in law.
4. The appeals are accordingly allowed. No costs
Appeals allowed.
