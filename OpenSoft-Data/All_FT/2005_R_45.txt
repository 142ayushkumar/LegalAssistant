M/S. Northern Minerals Ltd. & Ors. v Rajasthan Govt. & Anr.
Supreme Court of India

16 August 2005
Special Leave to Appeal (Crl) No(s).765/2005
1. We have heard counsel for the parties. Counsel for the appellants has relied upon two judgments of this Court reported in 2002 Indlaw SC 2271 and 1999 Indlaw SC 1366, for the proposition that the appellants having expressed their intention to adduce evidence in contraversion of the report of the Insecticide Analyst, were deprived of their right u/s. 24(4) of the Insecticides Act on account of the fact that the complaint itself was filed in court on 13/9/1995, much after the date on which the shelf life of the insecticide came to an end, that is, in August, 1995.
2. We notice that in the instant case, in the notice given to the appellants by the respondent, (Annexure P-2) dated 30th December, 1994 the appellants were informed that they could get the sample lying with them tested from the Central Insecticide Laboratory, Faridabad, Hyderabad or Bombay at their own expense with the permission of the competent court, if they were not satisfied with the report of the Analyst which had found the sample to be dis-branded.
3. Counsel for the the State submits that these facts did not exist in the cases to which reference has been made by the counsel for the appellants. However, in our view the matter requires to be considered. Special leave granted. Interim stay to continue.
Order accordingly
