(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Anil R. Dave, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
3. We have gone through the impugned judgement and noted the nature of injuries caused by fire arm to the victim. In our view, reduction of sentence by the High Court is not proper. We are of the view that atleast three years' sentence ought to have been imposed on the respondent-accused.
4. In these circumstances, we modify the impugned judgement to the effect that the sentence shall be enhanced to three years.
5. The appeal stands disposed of as allowed to the above extent.
Appeal disposed of
