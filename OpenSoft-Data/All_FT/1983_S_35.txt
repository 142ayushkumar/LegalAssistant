Daulat Ram (Dead) By Lrs. and Others v Sh. Santokh Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 September 1983
C.A. No. 1144 of 1970. (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 21 November 1969 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in Civil Revision No. 941 of 1968).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Respondent applied for fixing of fair rent of a piece of open land belonging to the deceased appellant u/s. 4 of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act.
2. The learned Rent Controller fixed the fair rent at Rs 72 per month. In an appeal by the respondent, the first Additional District Judge fixed the fair rent at Rs 38.50. After an unsuccessful revision petition to the High Court, the deceased landlord filed this appeal by special leave.
3. There is nothing in this controversy which should engage our attention save and except saying that there was no justification for interfering with the order of the learned Rent Controller fixing the fair rent at Rs 72 per month in respect of open plot of land situated in Mohalla Karim Purra in Ludhiana of Punjab and used by the respondents for carrying on some business.
4. We accordingly direct that the respondents shall pay rent at the rate of Rs 72 per month as fair rent effective from September 1, 1983 but the arrears shall be payable by them according to the fair rent determined by the First Additional District Judge.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
