Indian Bank v State of Bihar and Anr
Supreme Court of India

19 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1531/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Learned counsel for the appellant-Indian Bank has enumerated a number o circumstances as against the second respondent (who was arrayed as one of the four accused in the charge-sheet filed in the case). Before adverting to the rival contentions regarding the cirucumstances so enumerated, we have noticed that the impugned order is a non-speaking one.
It reads thus:
"Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the opposite parties and perused the materials on record. This revision application is dismissed."
2.  The High Court will dispose of the revision application afresh after adverting to the contentions with reference to the circumstances enumerated by the appellant-Bank. Counsel for the appellant bank submitted that those circumstances will be placed before the High Court again through a written submission. This is also recorded.
3.  The revision petition filed before the High Court will be disposed of afresh. With these observations the impugned order is set aside and this appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
