Devendra Kumar v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15951/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
The DPC made the impugned decision in June, 1990.
Petitioner waited for three years to file the writ petition.
1.  No explanation whatsoever is mentioned in the writ petition for such a long delay in questioning the decision of the DPC. As a matter of fact he thought of filing the writ petition after he was later promoted.
2. Though the said matter is not stated in the impugned judgment we considered that also. There is no merit in this Special Leave Petition. It is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
