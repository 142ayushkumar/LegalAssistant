The Order of the Court was as follows:
In Criminal Appeal No./2003 @ SLP (Crl.) No. 16/2003:- Leave granted.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The appellants have been granted bail in terms of the impugned order of the High Court dated 20th November, 2002. Their grievance is in respect of some of the conditions and stipulation of automatic cancellation of bail without any formal order of the Court. Having gone through the matter and examined the respective contentions, we are of the view that on the facts and circumstances of the case, the stipulation in the impugned order of automatic cancellation of the bail of the appellants is not called for.
2.  Therefore, to that extent, condition Nos. 3(i) and 3(ii) are modified. Instead, we direct that in case any appellant violates any condition on which he has been granted bail, it would be open to the State to apply for cancellation. In case such an application is moved, the appellant would, of course, have a right to defend and place before the Court his view point.
3.  Condition in the impugned order requiring the appellants to mark presence once a week on every Sunday before the nearest concerned police station is also modified. Instead, they would be required to mark their presence on alternate Sunday and not every Sunday. In respect of other conditions, the order is maintained.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
4.  Crl. A. Nos. ......./2003 @ SLP (Crl.) Nos. 5352, 5574, 5711 and 5708/02
Leave granted.
5.  The appellants are being prosecuted for offences punishable under Sections 3, 10, 13 and 15 of The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967
6.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the appellants deserve to be enlarged on bail. Thus, we order accordingly. They are directed to be released on bail on the same conditions as have been imposed by the High Court in the Order dated 20th November, 2002 in Crl. M.P. No. 6695 of 2002 subject to the modifications which we have directed in Civil Appeal No. of 2003 SLP (Crl.) No. 16 of 2003 today by a separate order as above.
We impose on these appellants as additional condition that they wound furnish to the police authorities the proof of residence duly verified by the concerned police station/s.
The appeals are allowed in the above terms.
Appeals allowed .
