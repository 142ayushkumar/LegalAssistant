Pradeep Kumar Pathak v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

6 March 1981
Cr.A. No. 255 of 1981.
The order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted limited to the question of sentence.
1.  We are of the view that having regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case and particularly in view of the fact that the petitioner was very young at the date when the offence was committed, the sentence of imprisonment imposed on the appellant may be reduced.
2.  We accordingly allow the appeal on the question of sentence and reduce the sentence imposed on the appellant to seven years' rigorous imprisonment. Mr Uniyal, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the State will ascertain whether there is any jail in U.P. where a young first offender can be kept apart from the hardened criminals so that he may not, by reason of coming into contact with hardened criminals, become brutalised. The matter will be placed on board only for this limited purpose after four weeks.
Appeal allowed.
