Rameshwar Dayal v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

30 April 1992
Cr.A. No. 231 of 1981
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The matter arise under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. The sample taken was found to be adulterated. On the record it appears that the report of the Public Analyst is not supplied to the accused as required under Section 13(2) of the Act. Consequently, he could not get his own sample examined by the Central Laboratory. It is a very valuable right given to him. Rules also provide that such a report should be supplied to the accused within a certain period.
2.  The question arose in a similar case where this rule is mandatory or directory. We need not launch into such a discussion in this case. We are satisfied that serious prejudice has been caused to the appellant because of non-supply of the Public Analyst's report as required under Section 13(2) of the Act.
3.   The High Court having noticed this, yet rejected the plea on the mere ground that such an objection was not raised before the trial court. It is not a question of an objection, but it is a question of prejudice. Such a point can be raised even at a later stage if material on record supports the same. In the result the conviction and sentence are set aside. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
