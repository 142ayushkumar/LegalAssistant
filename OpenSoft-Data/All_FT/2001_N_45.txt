Naini Devi and Others v Lakhe Khan (D) By Lrs. and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.22305/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Taken on Board.
1.  We see no justification for our interference with the impugned judgment of the High Court in second appeal. The suit for eviction had been decreed as early as on 16th March, 1971. The present suit was filed for setting aside the decree. The plaintiff lost in the Trial Court, which upheld in appeal and in the second appeal.
2. That apart, there is admission of PW.1 indicating the so-called partition in which the disputed property fell to Mohal Lal's share and the present applicants are legal representatives of the other brother of Kanhaiyalal. The SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
