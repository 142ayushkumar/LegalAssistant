Avik Pharmaceuticals Limited v Vasud Pharmaceuticals Limited
Supreme Court of India

3 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7510/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave granted.
1.  Respondent filed a summary suit for recovering Rs.24 lakhs on the ground of supply of raw materials for appellant's Company. Appellant filed an application for leave to defend which was rejected by the trial court. The High Court also dismissed the revision application filed by the appellant. That order is challenged by filing this appeal by special leave.
2.  Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that considering the dispute involved in the matter and the contention of the appellant that the goods supplied were defective and other issues involved in the matter, this was a fit case for grant of leave to defend and in any case on conditions. He submitted that if leave to defend is granted, appellant would deposit Rs.12 lakhs on or before 31st October, 2001 before the trial court.
3.  Considering the facts and issues involved, the impugned order passed by the High Court confirming the order passed by the trial court refusing to grant leave to defend is set aside. Leave to defend is granted on the condition that the appellant will deposit before the trial Court Rs.12 lakhs on or before 31st October, 2001.
4. On failure to deposit the said amount the order passed by the High Court as well as by the trial court would stand restored. The appeal is allowed accordingly with no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
