State of Gujarat v Haribhai Keshavbhai Patel
Supreme Court of India

4 January 1989
Cr.A. No. 598 of 1982
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  The State of Gujarat has filed this appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution praying for conviction being awarded to the respondent under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 instead of the conviction under Section 304 Part I awarded to him by the High Court.
2.   Having regard to the fact that the respondent had gone out of the factory premises after an exchange of words with the deceased Ismailbhai and returned about half an hour later with a knife in his hands and then inflicted a fatal injury on the abdomen of Ismailbhai which has been certified by the doctor or R. S. Naik, PW 6 to be an injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the learned Sessions Judge was justified in awarding conviction to the respondent under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for life.
3.  The High Court, however, has taken the vie that the respondent should have acted under grave and sudden provocation and hence the offence committed by there respondent can be held to be only under Section 304, Part Indian Penal Code, 1860 and modified the conviction of the respondent accordingly and awarded his a sentence of seven years' RI for the said conviction. There is force in the contention of the counsel for the State that the High Court was not justified in altering he conviction and sentence awarded to the respondent.
4.   Even so, due to the long interval of time that has occurred since the High Court had rendered the judgment under appeal and the fact that the respondent would have by now served out the sentence awarded to him by the High Court, we do not think this is a fit case where we should interfere with the judgment of the High Court in exercise of our powers under Article 136 of the Constitution.
In that view of the matter, we dismiss the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
