Learned Addl. Solicitor General appearing for the appellant-Union of India has produced before us a copy of the Tender Document. As per the Tender Document, it is the Engineer-in-Chief who is competent to appoint Engineer Officer as Arbitrator to dispose of the dispute between the parties.

All the questions of law and fact, including the question of limitation, will be open to be argued before the Arbitrator.
The appeal is allowed. No order as to costs.
