Dhyan Investments and Trading Company Limited v Central Bureau of Investigation and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2883/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard the learned senior counsel for the petitioner at length. We see no justification that the learned Judge should recuse himself from the case. We are not satisfied that there can be reasonable suspicion of bias against the learned Judge because in a civil case a decision has been rendered and a view taken on the question of conspiracy against the petitioner. This is no ground to plead that there can be a suspicion of bias.
Hence the Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
