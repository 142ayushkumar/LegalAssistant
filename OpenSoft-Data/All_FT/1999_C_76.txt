Toyo Engineering India Ltd v Collector Of Customs, Bombay
Supreme Court of India

27 October 1999
C.A. No. 4955 of 1994, Dt. 27 October 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The judgments and order under challenge are of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal. Four separate judgments were written by the bench of five learned Members which heard the matter. It is an admitted position that three of these judgments were written after the writer of the fourth judgment had retired.
Plainly, the judgments and order cannot stand.
2.  The appeal is allowed on this short ground and the matter (A.No. C/164/89-B2) is restored to the file of the Tribunal to be heard and disposed of afresh, expeditiously, by a bench to be constituted under the directions of its President.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
