The Judgment was delivered by : S. H. Kapadia, J.
Leave granted.
1.  The short question which we are required to decide in this batch of cases is - Whether inter se transfer of Non Performing Assets ("NPA" for short) by banks is illegal under Banking Regulation Act, 1949 ("BR Act, 1949" for short) as held by the Gujarat High Court in the impugned judgment? According to the impugned judgment(s), assignment of debts by banks inter se is not an activity which is permissible under the said BR Act, 1949 and consequently all executed contracts of assignment of debts were illegal. According to the impugned judgment(s), the assignee banks were not entitled to substitution in place of original lender (assignor) in proceedings relatable to companies in liquidation pending in the Company Court.
Facts in Civil Appeal @ S.L.P. (C) No. 2240 of 2009:
2.  On 31.3.2006 a Deed of Assignment was executed between Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. as assignee (Applicant) on one hand and ICICI Bank Ltd. as assignor. The recitals in the Deed show that ICICI Bank, in the course of its business, had granted various credit facilities to various borrowers (clients). These facilities are evidenced by various Financial Instruments executed by the borrowers and/or their respective guarantors/pledgers. In the recitals, it has been stipulated that ICICI Bank Ltd. as assignor was the absolute and beneficial owner of Financial Instruments and receivables thereunder.
3. An aggregate of Rs. 52.45 crores being the principal amount outstanding under the trade credit facilities was due and payable by the borrowers to ICICI Bank Ltd. (assignee). The assignor had agreed to sell and assign to the assignee, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., all debts together with interest on "as is where is" basis. Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., in turn, agreed to acquire the said debts on "as is where is" basis.
4. In consideration of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. paying the purchase price to ICICI Bank Ltd. for purchase of the debts, the assignor agreed to assign absolutely unto the assignee on "as is where is" basis, without the assignee having any recourse to the assignor. Consequently, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., assignee, became the full and absolute legal owner of the debts and as such the only person legally entitled to receive the repayments of debts. We quote hereinbelow the relevant provision of the Deed:
"2.2 On and from the date of the Agreement the Assignee and the Assignor hereby agree, undertake and confirm that notwithstanding
(i) the costs, charges, expense, taxes and duties to be paid or incurred by the Assignee towards the realization of the Debt; and
(ii) any settlement or compromise or restructuring of the Debt or the status of the Debt or creditworthiness of the Clients, the amounts to be paid by the Assignee towards Purchase Consideration in terms of the Agreement shall remain irrevocable and unconditional obligation of the Assignee hereof:
2.2.1 The Assignee shall have the sole and absolute right of collecting all amounts representing the Debts in such manner as the Assignee may in its absolute discretion determines;
2.2.2 The Assignor shall not be subject to any duties and/ or obligations in respect of the Financial Instruments;
2.2.3 The Assignee shall have all the rights and obligations under the Financial Instruments as if they were executed by the Clients in favour of the Assignee."
5.  One of the borrowers of ICICI Bank Ltd. at the relevant time was M/s A.P.S. Star Industries Ltd., a company which subsequently went under liquidation. By way of Company Application in the pending winding up proceedings before the Company Court, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. moved Company Application for being substituted in place of original secured creditor, ICICI Bank Ltd. This was pursuant to the Deed of Assignment dated 31.3.2006. The Company Application for substitution was moved at a stage of provisional/final winding up proceedings.
6. Before the Company Court, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. submitted that, as per BR Act, 1949 read with the Guidelines of Reserve Bank of India dated 13.7.2005, sale and purchase of debts, including the rights in immovable properties being secured creditors, can be sold by loaners and purchased by banks/financial institutions as assignees. According to Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., since proceedings for winding up were pending before the Company Court at various stages including the stage for disposal of properties of the companies in liquidation, they had approached the Company Court to be substituted in place of the original secured creditor, ICICI Bank Ltd. Before the Company Court, the secured creditor, ICICI Bank Ltd. admitted the execution of the Deed of Assignment dated 31.3.2006.
7. They supported the substitution of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. in the said application, however, such substitution was objected by the borrowers, who contended that the deed of assignment had not lawfully conveyed rights to the assignee to step into the shoes of ICICI Bank Ltd. (secured creditor). They raised various contentions including absence of proper conveyance and payment of stamp duty which aspects were not gone into by the impugned judgment of the Division Bench before us. The Company Court came to the conclusion that the impugned Deed was not presented in terms of Section 21 and also that the impugned Deed did not meet the requirement of the said section. However, the Company Court clarified that these were its prima facie observations. On the acquisition of rights by Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., the Company Court, however, held that the claimed rights were not acquired by the assignee, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., through the process known in law and therefore they cannot be permitted to be substituted in place of ICICI Bank Ltd. as secured creditor of the company in liquidation. Aggrieved by the said decision of the Company Court, the assignee, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. carried the matter in appeal to the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court as can be seen from the impugned order.
8. A number of questions of law were framed, e.g., whether the Company Court was justified in holding that a separate documentation of assignment of each loan transaction was required to be registered; whether the Company Court was justified in concluding that the Deed was not registered as per the provisions of Section 60 of the Registration Act, 1908 as also the question as to whether the Company Court was right in holding that rights were not acquired by the assignee, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., through the process known to law and therefore they cannot be allowed to be substituted in place of the secured creditor of the company in liquidation, namely, ICICI Bank Ltd.
9.  At this stage, it may be noted that by the impugned judgment, the High Court upheld the order of the Company Court only on the ground that assignment of debts by banks is not an activity which is permissible under the BR Act, 1949 and consequently the impugned Deed(s) was illegal and the assignee bank(s) was not entitled to substitution in place of ICICI Bank Ltd. (assignor). The Division Bench has not examined the other questions referred to above.
Submissions:
10.  Shri Harish N. Salve, learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that the Division Bench of the High Court erred in holding that in assigning debts with underlying security the assignor banks were trading in debts which was not permissible under the BR Act, 1949 because the assignor bank had never purchased debts, it had advanced loans against security which was a part of its banking business. That, it was only when the account became NPA that the assignor bank decided to dispose of the debt(s) which was its asset along with the underlying security. Similarly, the assignee bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., which acquired the debt along with the underlying security also did not sell the debt or the underlying security acquired as per RBI Guidelines. On the contrary, the assignee bank seeks to enforce recovery. Therefore, according to the learned counsel, neither the assignor bank nor the assignee bank ever traded in the debts as wrongly held by the impugned judgment. According to the learned senior counsel, there is a fundamental error in the approach of the High Court in the matter of interpretation of BR Act, 1949. That, "banking company" as defined in Section 5(c) read with Section 5(d) is, in the first instance, a company incorporated under the Companies Act,1956That, such companies are juridical entities which are entitled to assign their debts. That, unsecured debts are assignable as actionable claims under Transfer of Property Act, 1882 ("TP Act" for short) whereas secured debts such as mortgages were transferable by way of conveyance. Reliance in this connection was placed on the definition of the words "actionable claims" read with Sections 5, 6 and 8 of the TP Act. According to the learned counsel, it is clear from Section 2 of the BR Act, 1949 that the provisions of that Act are in addition to and not in derogation of the Companies Act, 1956 or any other law for the time being in force. Therefore, according to the learned counsel, in order to take away the effect of the TP Act, there should be something in the BR Act, 1949 in the form of express provision so as to exclude the provisions of the TP Act and in the absence of express prohibition the provisions of the TP Act stand excluded. Therefore, according to the learned counsel, there is no merit in the contention advanced on behalf of the borrowers that assignment of debts is ultra vires Section 5 read with Section 6 of the BR Act, 1949. According to the learned counsel, Section 5(b) of the BR Act, 1949 refers to the core activity of a bank, however, according to the learned counsel, Section 5(b) is not exhaustive, the said sub-section does not specify the range of activities that can be carried on by a bank for coordination of the banking business. According to the learned counsel, assignment is not limited to only NPAs but to debts in general. According to the learned counsel, as per Section 6(1)(a) of the BR Act, 1949 lending or advancing of money is indisputably a core activity of the bank. However, realization of such loans is an integral part of the core activity. In the alternative, it was submitted that, in any event, an activity of assignment of debt would fall within five of the clauses in Section 6(1) of the BR Act, 1949, namely, clause (a), clause (c), clause (g), clause (l) and clause (n). According to the learned counsel, only prohibition under the BR Act, 1949 so far as the business of a bank is concerned is contained in Sections 8 and 9 and neither of the said provisions limits or prohibits assignment of debts. According to the learned counsel, there is one more error in the impugned judgment. According to the High Court, Parliament had enacted Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 ("SARFAESI Act" for short) because the BR Act, 1949 did not permit banks to assign debts; that the SARFAESI Act is an exclusive Act for assignment of debts and that the said SARFAESI Act permitted banks to assign debts not inter se but only to certain specified entities like Asset Management Companies ("AMC" for short)/ Asset Reconstruction Companies.
11. According to the learned counsel, the High Court had failed to appreciate the object of the SARFAESI Act. It has failed to appreciate the provisions of that Act. According to the learned counsel, the concept of securitization is an economic and commercial concept; that, "asset construction" has been defined under Section 2(b) as acquisition by any securitization company or reconstruction company of any right or interest of any bank or financial institution in any financial assistance for the purpose of realization of such financial assistance; that, the expression "financial assistance" was limited to loans and advances given by banks or financial institutions; that Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act recognizes securitization as acquisition of any financial assets; that, securitization is a matter of contract and Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act makes a special machinery where financial assets of banks are acquired.
12. According to the learned counsel, this concept of securitization is a totally new concept as far as India is concerned and consequently the SARFAESI Act has no relevance as far as the issue in hand is concerned. Coming to the RBI Guidelines, learned counsel submitted that RBI is a regulator which has considered assignment of NPA not merely as part of the business of banking but also something which is conducive to the banking business; that, the RBI directives and guidelines have a statutory flavour and consequently if one goes through the said Guidelines they clearly indicate that banking is not confined only to the core activities enumerated in Section 5(b) of the BR Act, 1949.
13.  One of the arguments advanced before us on behalf of the borrowers was that before the High Court, Union of India had taken a position contra to the stand taken by RBI that trading in debts was not permissible under BR Act, 1949. In this connection, learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that Union of India, Ministry of Banking was never a party to the proceedings before the Company Court; that, in the winding up proceedings the BIFR was a party along with the Commissioner of Central Excise as claimant. Before the Company Court, the learned ASG appeared on behalf of BIFR and Central Excise Department; that, no affidavit was filed by the Union of India commenting on the RBI guidelines.
14. In the circumstances, learned counsel for the appellants submitted that position taken on behalf of the Union of India before the Company Court was not relevant. Learned counsel further pointed out that RBI appeared before the Company Court and supported the case of the appellants herein by placing reliance on their Guidelines. For the aforestated reasons, learned counsel submitted that the impugned judgment is erroneous and is liable to be set aside.
15.  In reply, Shri T.R. Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel appearing for the borrower, inter alia submitted that the assignment of financial instruments in possession of ICICI Bank Ltd. to Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., transfers not only the right of recovering debt but also transfers the obligations under the financial instruments "as if the said financial instruments were executed by the clients of ICICI Bank in favour of the assignee". That, the assignment of a debt can never carry with it the assignment of the obligations of the assignor. Unless there is a novation of the contract by all parties, there cannot be a transfer of the obligations of the assignor. In this connection, Shri Andhyarujina relied upon Section 130 of the TP Act, 1882. Therefore, according to the learned counsel, such an assignment cannot be legally sustained without novation of original contract executed by the assignor and the debtor.
16. Consequently, such assignment cannot under any circumstances come within the permissible mode of business under Section 6(1) of the BR Act, 1949. According to the learned counsel, there is no merit in the argument of the appellant that the words in Section 6 of the BR Act, 1949 "in addition to the business of banking" itself give to the ICICI Bank (assignor) the right to carry on all kinds of activities including the authority to assign debts owed to them irrespective of the enumerated items in Section 6(1)(a) to (o). According to the learned counsel for the borrower, the "business of banking" is found in the definition of "banking" and "banking company" in Sections 5(b) and (c) and restricts "banking business" only to accepting for the purpose of lending or investment of deposits of money.
17. In other words, according to the learned counsel, the business of banking is restricted by the BR Act, 1949 only to hard core, traditional concept of banking. That, there cannot be an activity of assigning debts by accepting deposits under Sections 5(b) and 5(c). Learned counsel further submitted that securitization involves assignment of debts under the said SARFAESI Act. In this connection, learned counsel placed reliance on Section 5 of that Act which inter alia states that securitization company or reconstruction company may "acquire" financial assets of a bank by entering into an agreement for the transfer of the financial assets. Such acquisition can only be if the originator assigns his debt to the securitization company. According to the learned counsel, the Parliament has now prescribed the only legal way of transferring financial assets under the SARFAESI Act which would include debts due to a bank (NPA or otherwise), by transfer to any securitization company or reconstruction company. Therefore, according to the learned counsel, there is no other legal way of transferring financial assets including dues due to bank except under the SARFAESI Act, which has no application in the present case as the said Act allows such transfers only in favour of specified companies namely, securitization company or reconstruction company and not in favour of banks or any other financial institutions. As regards NPA Norms of RBI, learned senior counsel submitted that RBI has not issued directives under Section 35A; that the relevant circular is by way of guidelines and is entitled "RBI Prudential Norms on Income Recognition Asset Classification and Provisioning Pertaining to Advances" dated 30th August, 2001. Lastly, learned counsel submitted that assignment of debt by ICICI Bank is not a mode of recovery.
18. According to the learned counsel, assignment of debt and recovery of debt are two different concepts. When there is recovery, the debt is totally extinguished whereas in the case of assignment the debt is not extinguished, the debt remains, the debtor remains, only the creditor changes. That, the assignee Bank cannot be said to be recovering debt when it in fact assigns the debt because both the debtor and the debt continue to exist and they are not extinguished. In the written submissions submitted on behalf of the borrower, one additional point is taken.
19. According to the borrower, in the present batch of cases all rights and liabilities have crystallized on the date of the winding up order and, therefore, assignment of debt by a bank cannot be permitted after the company is ordered to be wound up as that would amount to violating the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. For the afore-stated reasons, the learned counsel submitted that no interference is called for with the impugned judgment(s) and the appeals preferred by the assignor deserve to be dismissed.
Issues:
(i) Whether the Gujarat High Court was right in holding that assignment of debts by banks inter se is not an activity permissible under the BR Act, 1949 and consequently all executed contracts of assignment of debts were illegal?

21.  For the purpose of deciding Issue No. (i), we are also required to quote relevant portion of RBI Guidelines dated 13th July, 2005, which reads as under:
"Guidelines on purchase/ sale of Non Performing Financial Assets Scope
1. These guidelines would be applicable to banks, FIs and NBFCs purchasing/ selling non performing financial assets, from/ to other banks/FIs/NBFCs (excluding securitisation companies/ reconstruction companies).
2. A financial asset, including assets under multiple/consortium banking arrangements, would be eligible for purchase/sale in terms of these guidelines if it is a non-performing asset/non performing investment in the books of the selling bank.
3. The reference to 'bank' in the guidelines would include financial institutions and NBFCs."
22. Brief analysis of the BR Act, 1949
23.  The BR Act, 1949 provides for the comprehensive definition of "banking" so as to bring within its scope all institutions which receive deposits for lending or investment and to give RBI a control over banking companies. It is an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to banking. Section 2 clarifies that the 1949 Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the Companies Act, 1956 and any other law for the time being in force save as therein expressly provided. Section 5(1)(a) is the interpretation section. It defines "banking" to mean "accepting deposits for lending".
24. This is principal business of a bank. Section 5(1)(c) defines banking company as any company which transacts the business of banking. Thus, a banking company has to be a company in the first instance. Section 5(1)(ca) defines "banking policy" to mean any policy which is specified from time to time by RBI in the interest of banking system or in the interest of monetary stability or economic growth having due regard to the interest of the depositors and efficient use of these deposits. Part II deals with "business of banking companies". Section 6(1) in Part II says that in addition to the business of banking, a banking company may engage in any one or more of the forms of business enumerated in clauses (a) to (o).
25. It covers borrowing, lending, advancing of money; acquiring and holding and dealing with property (security) or right, title and interest therein; selling, improving leasing or turning into account or otherwise dealing with such security; doing all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the promotion or advancement of the business of the company and any other form of business which the Central Government may notify. Thus, Section 6(1) has a general provision and the provision which enumerates topics/fields in which the banks can carry on their business. Section 8 begins with non-obstante clause. It says that no banking company shall deal in the buying or selling of goods except in connection with the realization of security. Section 9 also begins with a non-obstante clause. It deals with restrictions on disposal of non-banking assets. Both Sections 8 and 9 are prohibitions and restrictions under the Act which are covered by the expression "save as except provided" in Section 2 of the Act.
26. As stated earlier, BR Act, 1949 is in addition to the Companies Act, 1956 or any other law for the time being in force and its provisions shall not be treated to be in derogation of any other laws save and except to the extent of any activity which is prohibited or restricted (See: Section 2). Section 12 says that no banking company shall carry on business unless it satisfies certain conditions. Section 17 refers to creation of Reserve Fund. Section 18 refers to creation of Cash Reserve. Section 20 refers to restrictions on loans and advances.
27. Section 21 deals with the power of RBI to control advances by banking companies. Section 21 empowers RBI to frame policies in relation to advances to be followed by banking companies. It further says that once such policy is made all banking companies shall be bound to follow them. Section 21(1) is once again a general provision empowering RBI to determine policy in relation to advances whereas Section 21(2) empowers RBI to give directions to banking companies as to items mentioned there i.e. in Section 21(2). Under Section 21(3) every banking company is bound to comply with directions given by RBI at the peril of penalty being levied for non-compliance. Section 35A says that where RBI is satisfied that in the interest of Banking Policy it is necessary to issue directions to banking companies it may do so from time to time and the banking companies shall be bound to comply with such directions. Thus, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21 and 35A of the said Act, RBI can issue directions having statutory force of law. Section 36 deals with further powers and functions of RBI. Under Section 39 it is the RBI who shall be the Official Liquidator in any proceedings concerning winding up of a banking company.
28.  The above analysis of the various provisions of the 1949 Act shows that RBI is empowered to regulate the business of the banking companies. That, RBI is empowered to control management of banking companies in certain situations. It is empowered to lay down conditions on which the banking companies will operate. It is empowered to regulate paid-up capital, reserve fund, cash fund and above all to lay down policies in the matter of advances to be made by the banking companies, allocation of resources etc. While laying down such policies under the said Act, RBI can lay down parameters enabling banking companies to expand its business.
29. For example, RBI's permission is required to be obtained if a banking company seeks to deal in "derivatives". It is a business which will not fall in clauses (a) to (o) of Section 6(1)(a) and yet RBI can lay down guidelines and directions enabling banking companies to deal in derivatives like futures and options. The point we are trying to make is that apart from the principal business of accepting deposits and lending the said 1949 Act leaves ample scope for the banking companies to venture into new businesses subject to such businesses being subject to the control of the Regulator, viz. RBI. In other words, the 1949 Act allows banking companies to undertake activities and businesses as long as they do not attract prohibitions and restrictions like those contained in Sections 8 and 9.
30. In this connection we need to emphasize that Section 6(1)(n) enables a banking company to do all things as are incidental or conducive to promotion or advancement of the business of the company. Section 6(1) enables banking companies to carry on different types of businesses. Under Section 6(1), these different types of businesses are in addition to business of banking, viz., core banking. The importance of the words "in addition to" in Section 6(1) is that even if different businesses under clauses (a) to (o) are shut down, the company would still be a banking company as long as it is in the core banking of accepting deposits and lending so that its main income is from the spread or what is called as "interest income".
31. Thus, we may broadly categorise the functions of the banking company into two parts, viz., core banking of accepting deposits and lending and miscellaneous functions and services. Section 6 of the BR Act, 1949 provides for the form of business in which banking companies may engage. Thus, RBI is empowered to enact a policy which would enable banking companies to engage in activities in addition to core banking and in the process it defines as to what constitutes "banking business". The BR Act, 1949 basically seeks to regulate banking business. In the cases in hand we are not concerned with the definition of banking but with what constitutes "banking business". Thus, the said BR Act, 1949 is an open-ended Act.
32. It empowers RBI (regulator and policy framer in matter of advances and capital adequacy norms) to develop a healthy secondary market, by allowing banks inter se to deal in NPAs in order to clean the balance sheets of the banks which guideline/policy falls under Section 6(1)(a) r/w Section 6(1)(n). Therefore, it cannot be said that assignment of debts/NPAs is not an activity permissible under the BR Act, 1949. Thus, accepting deposits and lending by itself is not enough to constitute the "business of banking". The dependence of commerce on banking is so great that in modern money economy the cessation even for a day of the banking activities would completely paralyse the economic life of the nation. Thus, the BR Act, 1949 mandates a statutory comprehensive and formal structure of banking regulation and supervision in India.
33.  The test to be applied is - whether trading in NPAs has the characteristics of a bona fide banking business. That test is satisfied in this case. The guidelines issued by RBI dated 13.7.2005 itself authorizes banks to deal inter se in NPAs. These guidelines have been issued by the Regulator in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21 and 35A of the Act. They have a statutory force of law. They have allowed banks to engage in trading in NPAs with the purpose of cleaning the balance sheets so that they could raise the capital adequacy ratio.
34. All this comes within the ambit of Section 21 which enables RBI to frame the policy in relation to Advances to be followed by the banking companies and which empowers RBI to give directions to banking companies under Section 21(2). These guidelines and directions following them have a statutory force. When a delegate is empowered by the Parliament to enact a Policy and to issue directions which have a statutory force and when the delegatee (RBI) issues such guidelines (Policy) having statutory force, such guidelines have got to be read as supplement to the provisions of the BR Act, 1949. The "banking policy" is enunciated by RBI. Such policy cannot be said to be ultra vires the Act. The idea behind empowering RBI to determine the Policy in relation to Advances is to enable banking companies to expand their business of banking and in that sense such guidelines also define - as to what constitutes banking business. Trading in NPA - a misnomer
35.  At the outset one needs to know what is NPA? When a borrower who is under liability to pay to secured creditors, makes default in repayment of secured debt or any installment thereof, the account of borrower is classified as Non-Performing Asset (NPA). Such NPAs cannot be used for any productive purpose. Continuous growth in NPAs threatens the repayment capacity of the banks. They have an adverse impact on the financial strength of the banks which in the present era of globalization are required to conform to International Standards. Thus, NPA means an asset or account receivable of a borrower, which has been classified by banks or financial institutions in terms of RBI Guidelines as sub-standard, doubtful etc. These guidelines are issued to improve quality of assets of the banks. The 2005 guidelines of RBI are not to eliminate NPAs but to restructure. The BR Act, 1949 vide Section 21 empowers RBI in the interest of the Banking Policy to lay down guidelines in relation to advances to be followed by banking companies. The 2005 guidelines have been issued as "a restructuring measure" in order to avoid setbacks in the banking system. NPAs do not generate interest. 85% of the Indian Banks' income comes from interest. Thus, NPAs adversely impact profits of the banks and hence, as a matter of Banking Policy, RBI as Regulator seeks through its guidelines under Section 21 r/w Section 35A to manage these NPAs and not to eliminate. The said guidelines deal with restructuring of the banking system which is one of the objects behind giving authority to RBI to frame "banking policy". One more aspect needs to be kept in mind. In this batch of cases we are dealing with assets in the hands of banks. NPAs are "Account Receivables". The impugned guidelines show that RBI considers inter se NPA assignment between banks to be a tool for resolving the issue of NPAs and in the interest of banking policy under Section 21 of the BR Act, 1949. The object is to minimize the problem of credit risk. The corporate debt restructuring is one of the methods for reducing NPAs. Thus, such restructuring as a matter of banking policy cannot be treated as "trading". One has to keep in mind the object behind enactment of BR Act, 1949. Thus, the said Guidelines fall under Section 21 of the 1949 Act.
36. These Guidelines are a part of Credit Appraisal Mechanism. Thus, in our view the impugned Guidelines are not ultra vires the BR Act, 1949. Dealing in NPAs as part of the Credit Appraisal Mechanism and as a part of Restructuring Mechanism falls within Section 21 r/w Section 35A of the Act. Hence, it cannot be said that "transfer of debts/NPAs" inter se between banks is an activity which is impermissible under the 1949 Act. The BR Act, 1949 is an Act enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to banking. Thus, while interpreting the Act one needs to keep in mind not only the framework of the banking law as it stood in 1949 but also the growth and the new concepts that have emerged in the course of time. (see: Principles of Statutory Interpretation by G.P. Singh, 11th edition at page 328.)
37.  Thus, in our view on reading the provisions of the BR Act, 1949 with the Guidelines of RBI issued from time to time in relation to Advances and Re-structuring/Management of NPAs we are of the view that the BR Act, 1949 is a complete Code on banking and that dealing in NPAs inter se by the banks needs to be looked in the larger framework of "Re-structuring of banking System". Thus, we need not go into the provisions of the said TP Act. In fact, it is the case of the borrower(s) that provisions of the said TP Act has no application. (See Written Submissions filed on 31.8.2010). Invocation of Section 130 of TP Act, 1882
38.  In the alternative, since the borrower(s) has relied on Section 130 of the said TP Act, one needs to analyse the contentions raised in that regard. According to the borrower(s) assignment of Financial Instruments in possession of ICICI Bank Ltd. to Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. transfers not merely the right to recover the debt but also transfers the obligations under the Financial Instruments "as if they were executed by the clients of ICICI Bank in favour of the assignee", i.e., Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. According to the borrower(s), an assignment of a debt can never carry with it the assignment of the obligations of the assignor unless there is a novation of the contract by all parties. Therefore, according to the borrower(s), the impugned Deed of Assignment is legally unsustainable without novation of original contract between ICICI Bank Ltd. (assignor) and the borrower(s) (assignee). We find no merit in the above arguments.
39.  As stated above, an outstanding in the account of a borrower(s) (customer) is a debt due and payable by the borrower(s) to the bank. Secondly, the bank is the owner of such debt. Such debt is an asset in the hands of the bank as a secured creditor or mortgagee or hypothecatee. The bank can always transfer its asset. Such transfer in no manner affects any right or interest of the borrower(s) (customer). Further, there is no prohibition in the BR Act, 1949 in the bank transferring its assets inter se. Even in the matter of assigning debts, it cannot be said that the banks are trading in debts, as held by the High Court(s). The assignor bank has never purchased the debt(s). It has advanced loans against security as part of its banking business. The account of a client in the books of the bank becomes Non Performing Asset when the client fails to repay. In assigning the debts with underlying security, the bank is only transferring its asset and is not acquiring any rights of its client(s). The bank transfers its asset for a particular agreed price and is no longer entitled to recover anything from the borrower(s). The moment ICICI Bank Ltd. transfers the debt with underlying security, the borrower(s) ceases to be the borrower(s) of the ICICI Bank Ltd. and becomes the borrower(s) of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (assignee).
40. At this stage, we wish to once again emphasize that debts are assets of the assignor bank. The High Court(s) has erred in not appreciating that the assignor bank is only transferring its rights under a contract and its own asset, namely, the debt as also the mortgagee's rights in the mortgaged properties without in any manner affecting the rights of the borrower(s)/mortgagor(s) in the contract or in the assets. None of the clauses of the impugned Deed of Assignment transfers any obligations of the assignor towards the assignee.
41. In the case of Khardah Company Ltd. v. Raymon & Co. (India) Private Ltd. reported in (1963) 3 S.C.R. 183 1962 Indlaw SC 575 the Supreme Court has held that the law on the subject of assignment of a contract is well settled. An assignment of a contract might result by transfer either of the rights or by transfer of obligations thereunder. There is a well recognized distinction between the two classes of assignments. As a rule, obligations under a contract cannot be assigned except with the consent of the promisee, and when such consent is given, it is really a novation resulting in substitution of liabilities.
42. That, rights under a contract are always assignable unless the contract is personal in its nature or unless the rights are incapable of assignment, either under the law or under an agreement between the parties. A benefit under the contract can always be assigned. That, there is, in law, a clear distinction between assignment of rights under a contract by a party who has performed his obligation thereunder and an assignment of a claim for compensation which one party has against the other for breach of contract.
43.  In the case of Camdex International Ltd. v. Bank of Zambia reported in [1998] Q.B. 22 (CA) the following observation which is relevant to the present case needs to be quoted:
"The assignment of a debt will not be contrary to public policy solely on the grounds that the assignee has purchased the debt for a considerably discounted price or because that price is only payable after a period of credit. Nor will the assignment be contrary to public policy simply because the assignee may make a profit on the transaction at the end of the day. If there was no prospect of a profit, Hobhouse LJ observed, commercial entities would never purchase debts."
44.  Similarly, the following proposition in Chitty on Contracts, 27th edn. (1994) at para 19.027 is relevant to be noted.
"It is also well established that a claim to a simple debt is assignable even if the debtor has refused to pay. The practice of assigning or 'selling' debts to debt collecting agencies and credit factors could hardly be carried on if the law were otherwise. "
45.  In view of the above exposition of law, we find that under the impugned Deed of Assignment only the Account Receivables in the books of ICICI Bank Ltd. has been transferred to Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. The obligations of ICICI Bank Ltd. towards its borrower(s) (customer) under the loan agreement secured by deed of hypothecation/mortgage have not been assigned by ICICI Bank Ltd. to the assignee bank, namely, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Hence, it cannot be said that the impugned Deed of Assignment is unsustainable in law. The obligations referred to in the impugned Deed of Assignment are the obligations, if any, of ICICI Bank Ltd. towards Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (assignee) in the matter of transfer of NPAs. For example, when an Account Receivable is treated as NPA and assigned to the assignee bank, the parties have to follow certain Guidelines issued by RBI.
46. If there is a breach of the Guidelines or statutory directions issued by RBI by Assignor in regard to transfer of NPA then the assignee bank can enforce such obligations vis-'-vis the assignor bank. It is these obligations which are referred to in the impugned Deed of Assignment. That, an Account Receivable becomes an NPA only because of the default committed by the borrower(s) who fails to repay. Lastly, it may be mentioned that the said SARFAESI Act, 2002 was enacted enabling specified SPVs to buy the NPAs from banks. However, from that it does not follow that banks inter se cannot transfer their own assets. Hence the said SARFAESI Act, 2002 has no relevance in this case.
47.  Before concluding, we may state that NPAs are created on account of the breaches committed by the borrower. He violates his obligation to repay the debts. One fails to appreciate the opportunity he seeks to participate in the "Transfer of Account Receivable" from one bank to the other.
Conclusion:
48.  As stated above, by the impugned judgment, the Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court upheld the order of the Company Court only on one ground, namely, assignment of debts by the banks inter se is an activity which is impermissible under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. However, the Division Bench did not go into other issues which arose for determination before the Company Court, including applicability of the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908.
49.  In the circumstances, we set aside the impugned judgment(s) on the question of assignment of debts as an activity permissible under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
. However, we remit these matters to the Division Bench of the High Court(s) for consideration of other issues raised in this batch of cases. Subject to above, the impugned judgment(s) is set aside and the civil appeals are allowed with no order as to costs.
