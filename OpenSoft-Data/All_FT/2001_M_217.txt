Manohar Punjabi v Kavita Sharma and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9646/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  By our last order dated 25th January 2001, the cost awarded by the trial court was fixed at Rs.10,000/-. However, before signing the said order, learned counsel for the respondent mentioned that certain aspects could not be placed before this Court, hence we permitted to place the same before us.
2. We heard the matter today thereafter. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we do not find any ground which calls for modifying our said order dated 25th January 2001. Accordingly, the order dated 25th January 2001 is confirmed.
3.  As a consequence of this, the respondent shall now refund Rs. 60,000/- to the appellant within a period of six weeks.
4.  With the said observation, the present Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
