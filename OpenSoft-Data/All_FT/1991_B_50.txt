State of Punjab v Bir Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

24 October 1991
S.L.P. (Cri) No. of 1991 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 17 April 1989, 1 July 1989 and 11 December 1989 of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in Sessions Case No. 871 of 1988, Bali Appln. No. Nil of 1989 and Cri. Misc. No. 9053-M(A) of 1989)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is a long inordinate and inexcusable delay. There is no sufficient cause for condoning the delay. We fail to understand why the State Government is not able to take a decision with despatch to file appeals if they are serious about the same.
2.   In one of the matters concerning Baldev Singh, we find that the appeal is directed against the order rejecting the application for cancellation of bail on the ground that in the main matter the accused has been acquitted.
3.  Even after noticing this in the list of dates the appeal is preferred for cancellation of bail which is indeed very surprising and waste of public time and money. A copy of this order may be forwarded to the Governor of the State of Punjab to enable him to streamline the administration so that such inordinate delays do not take place and frivolous matter are not brought to this Court.
4.  We see no reason to interfere in any of these cases. Hence dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
