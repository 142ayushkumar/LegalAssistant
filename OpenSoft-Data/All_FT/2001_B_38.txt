B.V. Satish v State of Karnataka and Others
Supreme Court of India

16 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20843/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In our view, the interim order passed by the High Court does not call for any interference. The High Court has specifically stated that actual promotions pursuant to the seniority list, which may be prepared, will not be given effect until further orders which may be passed by the Court.
2.  Hence, this special leave petition is dismissed. It would be open to the learned counsel for the parties to move the High Court for expeditious hearing of Writ Petition No.45082 of 1999.
3.  We make it clear that the seniority list, which may be prepared on the basis of the Rules would be subject to the final decision in the said writ petition.
Petition dismissed.
