The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, we are not inclined to interfere with the order under challenge and, therefore, the Special Leave Petitions are dismissed.
2.  However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and, particularly, in view of the fact that the children of the petitioners are studying in the nearby schools and the time granted by the High Court would be expiring by the end of February, 2001, we extend the time for vacating the premises in question till the end of May, 2001 subject to their filing usual undertakings within two weeks from today.
