State of Uttar Pradesh v Dr. S. P. Saxena and Another
Supreme Court of India

11 December 1986
C.A. No. 1175 of 1973.
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the High Court. The report of the assessors was not supplied to respondent 1 notwithstanding the requirement of Rule 9(1) of the U.P. Disciplinary Proceedings (Administrative Tribunal) Rules. 1947. Failure to supply the report resulted in violation of Natural Justice in any case. This failure has been considered to be fatal to the departmental proceedings so as to vitiate the order of dismissal passed against respondent 1.
2.   We are no reason to interfere with the order passed by the High Court. The appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed with no order as to costs. The interim orders passed by this Court are vacated. The High Court's order shall be complied with within four months from today.
Appeal dismissed.
