Union of India v Krishanu Ranjan Chakraborty and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6457/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order as the delay was whopping.
Mr. Altaf Ahmad, learned Additional Solicitor General submits that another Bench of the same High Court condoned delay of similar range, if not above, in other cases emanating from the same Notification under the Land Acquisition Act.
2. Still we are not interfering with the impugned order as the amount involved is only less than 
Rs.40,000/-. But we make it clear that this dismissal is without considering the question of law involved and the other contentions raised.
The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
