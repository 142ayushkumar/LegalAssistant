Arun Kumar Patra v Shila Patra Alias Shrila Patra
Supreme Court of India

6 April 2005
C.A. No. 5429 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the appellant.
1.  The trial court granted interim maintenance at the rate of Rs 1000 per month. When the matter was taken to the High Court in revision, the same has been enhanced from Rs 1000 to Rs 3500 per month. Hence, this appeal by special leave.
2.  It appears that at the time of issuing notice on 10-7-2002, this Court granted an order of stay, meaning thereby that operation of the impugned order shall remain stayed. Thereafter, leave was granted on 26-8-2002 and interim order was allowed to continue. The respondent has not entered appearance to contest the prayer on behalf of the appellant in this appeal.
3. As the matter has remained pending for a period of more than two years and the interim arrangement allowed by the trial court is still continuing, we feel that the trial court should be directed to dispose of Matrimonial Suit No. 725 of 1998 with utmost expedition and during the pendency of the suit, the interim order passed by this Court should continue.
4.  Accordingly, the appeal is disposed of and the trial court is directed to dispose of the aforesaid suit as expeditiously as possible and preferably within a period of one year from the date of receipt of copy of this order by the trial court. During the pendency of the suit, the interim order passed by this Court on 10-7-2002 shall continue.
No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
