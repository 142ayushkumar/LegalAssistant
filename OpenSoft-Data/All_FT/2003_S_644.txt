State of Punjab and others v Baldev Singh and others
Supreme Court of India

9 January 2003
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 16612/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the appellants seeks permission to delete respondent No.36. Permission granted at the risk of the appellants.
Heard counsel.
Leave granted.
2.  The main arguments of the State of Punjab in this appeal is that the civil writ petition 10281/99 is not really connected with CWP No. 1815/99 which was disposed of by a common judgment by the High Court. Learned counsel for the respondent is not able to convince us that in fact the CWP No. 10281/99 is in any manner, connected with CWP 1815/91.
3. Therefore, we are in agreement with the learned counsel for the State that the former writ petition ought to have been independently considered. In the said view of the matter we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment so far as CWP 10281/99 is concerned and remand the matter back to the High Court for fresh consideration independent of the judgment in CWP 1815/99. The appeal is allowed to this extent.
Appeal partly allowed.
