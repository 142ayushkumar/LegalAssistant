Sant Ram and Others v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

21 November 1995
Civil Appeal No. 241 of 1985 etc. with Civil Appeal No. 11538 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows :
C.A. NO.241/85
1.  Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, 'the Act') was published in the Union Gazette on February 21, 1973. The Collector in his award dated May 25, 1974 determined the compensation @ Rs.4,280/- per Bigha rounded to Rs.50/- per sq. yd. The Additional Judge by his award and decree dated August 8, 1978, enhanced the compensation to Rs.6,420/- per bigha. The High Court further enhanced it in appeal by judgment and decree dated July 10, 1984 to Rs.12,000/- per bigha. Still dissatisfied therewith, the appellants filed this appeal by special leave.
2.  Shri P.P. Juneja, learned counsel appearing for the appellants contends that this Court in Gokal vs. State of Haryana [(1992) Supp 2 SCC 69] 1991 Indlaw SC 1011 had taken judicial notice of constant rise in the prices and fixed the market value at different rates depending upon the year of acquisition. The appellants' lands are also situated within the master plan of the Delhi Development Authority. They are also entitled to compensation @ Rs.13 per sq. yd. In Jailal & Ors. vs. Union of India C.A. No.830/81 decided on February 23, 1981, this Court found that the market-value of Nangal Dewat notified under Section 4(1) published on December 3, 1971 would fetch @ Rs.13/- per sq. yd.
3.  Having given consideration to the pursuasive arguments of Mr. P.P. Juneja, we think it is difficult to accept the contention. It is seen that for the lands in Shahbad Mohammeddpur village which is now part of the lands in this case, compensation was determined @ Rs.12/- per sq. yd., i.e.,Rs.12,000/- per bigha. The lands are claimed to be on par with the lands in Nangal Dewat. But when the lands in the entire village has been determined at Rs.12/- per sq. yd., we do not think we would be justified in further increasing the compensation to the appellants' lands on mere pursuing the remedy by way of appeal.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
IN C.A /95. (@ SLP (C) No. 14912/89)
Leave granted.
4.  In view of the above judgment made in C.A. No. 241 of 1985, the appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeals dismissed
