Raghumunda Satya Narayana v State of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

10 January 2000
Cr.A. No. 23 of 2000 .
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In this case appellant was convicted under section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code and was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for one year.
2. He filed an appeal which was dismissed and the High Court in Revision reduced the sentence to imprisonment for 6 months.
3.  When this appeal was pending for special leave the warring spouses came to terms. An affidavit has been sworn to by the aggrieved wife in which she said that she had come to terms with her husband and would prefer to have a peaceful life with him and expressed the apprehension that if the sentence is to be undergone by him for the remaining period the expected peace would elude the couple.
4.  We too feel that in view of the subsequent developments the sentence already undergone by the appellant can be treated as sufficient for the offence found against him. In the result we reduce the sentence to the period already undergone by the appellant.
This appeal is accordingly disposed of.
Appeal Disposed of.
