Union of India v Raghu Nath and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7933-7934/1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Substition allowed.
Leave granted.
1. Against enhancement of the compensation, Union of India filed regular First Appeal before the High Court of Punjab & Haryana. The said appeal was admitted. However, no interim stay order was granted. Against refusal of the impugned stay order, the appellant filed the present appeals. This Court while issuing notice passed the following order:
"Issue notice on the application for condonation of delay as well as on SLP.
Interim stay subject to the condition that petitioner should pay Rs.20, 000/- per acre. There shall be stay of balance amount of Rs.30, 000/- pending disposal.The respondents are at liberty to withdraw the amount deposited at Rs.20, 000/- per acre without any security."
We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
2.  We feel that these appeals deserve to be decided in terms of the interim order passed by this Court on 26.3.1997.
3.  Accordingly, the order under challenge is set aside and the appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
4. However, the parties shall be at liberty to make a request before the High Court for expeditious hearing of the regular first appeal pending before the High Court.
Appeal disposed of.
