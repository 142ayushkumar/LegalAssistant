Des Raj and others v Parbhati
Supreme Court of India

30 September 2010
C.A. No(s). 7887 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard Dr. Sushil Balwada, learned counsel, appearing for the appellants.
1.  The sole respondent has been served with the notice but has not chosen to enter appearance.
2.  This Appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dated 12.04.1996 passed in Regular Second Appeal No. 1463 of 1989 which has been allowed by reversing the judgment of the first appellate court. The facts have been set out in the impugned judgment and hence we are not repeating the same here.
3.  The short question in this case is whether the Haryana Act No. 10 of 1995 by which the right of a co-sharer to claim pre-emption has been abolished will apply to a case where the appeal arising out of a suit for pre-emption is pending.
4.  In the instant case, the suit was filed on 06.09.1985 which is long before the amended provision in Haryana Act No. 10 of 1995 came into force. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Shyam Sunder and Others v Ram Kumar and Another 2001 Indlaw SC 21401, has held as under:
"The result of the aforesaid discussion is that the amending Act being prospective in operation does not affect the rights of the parties to the litigation on the date of adjudication of the pre-emption suit and the appellate court is not required to take into account or give effect to the substituted S. 15 introduced by the amending Act."
5.  The impugned judgment of the High Court is based entirely upon the decision of this Court in Karan Singh Vs. Bhagwan Singh1996 Indlaw SC 3141. The decision in Karan Singh's case 1996 Indlaw SC 3141 has been overruled by this Court in Shyam Sunder's case 2001 Indlaw SC 21401. The impugned judgment is, therefore, unsustainable but since other issues that may have been raised before the High Court in the second appeal have not been examined the matter shall have to be remanded back to the High Court to do so.
6. We, accordingly, allow this Appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and remand the matter back to the High Court for a fresh and expeditious disposal of the case in accordance with law dealing with all other issues that the parties may raise before the High Court. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
