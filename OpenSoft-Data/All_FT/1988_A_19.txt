All India Bank of Baroda Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Employees' Welfare Association v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

18 August 1988
W. P. No. 1594 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The principal question agitated in this petition is whether the officers working in public sector banks are governed by the Presidential directive dated 16-2-1982 or by para 9.2 in Chapter 9 of the Brochure on Reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Services, 7th Edn. (1987), insofar as promotion by selection method is concerned. After this case is heard for some time, Ms Lata Krishnamurthy, learned counsel for the petitioner, Shri Vikram Mahajan learned counsel for the Union of India and Mr. F. D. Damania learned counsel for the Bank of Baroda concede that the question of promotion, by selection, of officers in public sector banks is governed by the rules contained in para 9.2 in Chapter 9 of the Brochure referred to above and that it is not necessary to rely upon the Presidential directive dated 16-2-1982. Ms Lata Krishnamurty further submits that after the amendment of the rules of reservation, there is no difference between the Presidential directive and the rules contained in the Brochure insofar as the question of promotion by selection method of officers within Group A (Class 1) is concerned.
2.   In view of the above concession made by the learned counsel for the parties, we make a declaration that the promotion by selection method of officers within Group A (Class 1) in the bank of Baroda shall be done in accordance with the rules contained in para 9.2 in Chapter 9 of the Brochure. This order disposes of this petition. If any of the officers of the Bank of Baroda feel aggrieved by the non-implementation of the Brochure of para 9.2 in this case, it is open to him to approach the High Court for necessary relief. Interim orders, if any, are vacated and the writ petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
