Amit Ramendranath Roy v Ritushri Amit Roy
Supreme Court of India

24 January 2005
Transfer Petition (C) No. 553 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner husband has moved this petition under Section 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure for transfer of matrimonial suit being PA No. 518 of 2002 titled Amit Ramendranath Roy v. Ritushri Amit Roy filed by him pending before the Family Court No. 1 at Pune, Maharashtra to the Court of District Judge, Burdwan, to be assigned to a court of competent jurisdiction at Durgapur.
2. When the suit was instituted the petitioner as well as the respondent were residing at Pune. The petitioner has been transferred and is now living in Kolkata. According to him, the respondent wife is now living at Durgapur.
3.  After taking into consideration the submission made by the counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that a case for transfer of the matrimonial suit has been made out. Prima facie it seems that the respondent is living at Durgapur now. She herself has filed a number of cases at Durgapur against the petitioner. Since she is attending to the cases which have been filed by her at Durgapur, there would be no difficulty for her to attend to this case as well at Durgapur; rather it would be convenient for her to do so.
4. Accordingly, we order the transfer of matrimonial suit being PA No. 518 of 2002 titled Amit Ramendranath Roy v. Ritushri Amit Roy pending before the Family Court No. 1 at Pune, Maharashtra to the Court of District Judge, Burdwan.
5.  The District Judge, Pune, Maharashtra is directed to transmit the entire record related to the abovesaid case forthwith to the District Judge, Burdwan who on receipt of the same may assign it to a court of competent jurisdiction at Durgapur.
The transfer petition is allowed accordingly.
Petition allowed.
