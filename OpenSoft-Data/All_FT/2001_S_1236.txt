Maqsood Ahmad Khan v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1492/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The son of the petitioner is directed to furnish the particulars of the properties of the petitioner which can be attached so that the steps can be taken for the arrest of the petitioner - Maqsood Ahmad Khan.
2.  It is indeed surprising that the Director General of Police, U.P. has not been able to apprehend one person who has been convicted under Section 396 IPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life. If the Police Authorities has failed to apprehend one person, it is difficult to imagine how they can maintain law and order in the State. This indicates the 2 utter callousness of the Police Authorities in maintaining law and order in the State.
3. We call upon the Director General of Police, State of U.P. to be present in person on 7th of January, 2002 and file an affidavit indicating what steps had been taken for apprehending Maqsood Ahmad Khan. Put up on 7th January, 2002.
Order accordingly.
