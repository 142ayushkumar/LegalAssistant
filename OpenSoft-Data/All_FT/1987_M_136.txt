Supreme Court of India

29 October 1987
Civil Miscellaneous Petitions Nos. 26411-12 of 1987 (Arising out of W.P. Nos. 348-52 of 1985)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In 1986 when this Court was about to direct introduction of All India Examination for post-graduate course there was an observation that in regard to the first year, some adjustment if necessary could be made in regard to difficulties which may arise with reference to students in different States.
2.  Keeping that in view and confined to the year of 1987 only, we are prepared to accept the request made in this petition. The date of eligibility as fixed by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences is March 31, 1988, for entitlement to sit at the examination, it may be shifted to April 15, 1988 so as to cover the case of the petitioners.
3. In this miscellaneous application we are, however, not prepared to change the date schedule. According to it the last date of receipt of the applications is October 31, 1987. In case applications can be received by October 31, 1987 from those who are intended to be benefited by this application, we have no objection to their applications being entertained. The application is disposed of accordingly.
Application disposed of.
