Krishna Mohan Barman v State of Assam
Supreme Court of India

24 November 1999
Cr.A. No. 970 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is under Section 19 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (for short TADA) assailing the conviction and sentence of the appellant under Section 4(4) of the Act. The appellant has been sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years by the learned Designated Judge. The sole basis of conviction is the recovery of some documents alleged to have been hidden by one Pradip Kalita who was arrested in the course of investigation into an offence arising out of Bilaspara Police Station case. No doubt the statement of the said Pradip becomes admissible under Section 15 of the Act but by no stretch of imagination the said statement and the recovery of the document in question from the house of the appellant, would attract sub-section (4) of Section 4 of the Act inasmuch as to attract sub-section (4) what is required to be proved by the prosecution is that the appellant has either hide out or concealed or attempted to hide out or conceal any terrorist.
2. In our considered opinion it is difficult to conclude that the appellant did hide out or conceal or attempted to hide out or conceal any terrorist merely because some documents were recovered from the premises in question.
3.  Mr. Jain, appearing for the State also fairly conceded that it is difficult to support the conviction in question. We, accordingly set aside the conviction and sentence and allow this appeal. The appellant may be set at liberty forthwith.
Appeal allowed.
