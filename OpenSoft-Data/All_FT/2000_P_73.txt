Pepsu Rpad Transport Corpn, Punjab v Harbhajan Singh
Supreme Court of India

9 November 2000
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 417/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  At the time issue of notice, the Court confined the examination to the question of the appropriate back wages to be awarded. That was on the basis of the statement made by the respondent to the effect that he had not taken any fare from the concerned passengers as they were students of tender age. But he gave them punched tickets only for the reason that Inspector would report against him. He had not given them unpunched tickets as they were passengers aged from 8 to 11 years. It is not improbable that he might not have collected any fare from them.
2. In these circumstances, Labour Court was certainly justified in deducting the back wages to the extent of 30 percent and in not awarding the full back wages.
3.  Therefore, the High Court was justified in not interfering with the award made by the Labour Court nor do we think there is any reason to interfere. The appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
