Supreme Court of India

12 November 1992
W.Ps. (C) No. 13380 of 1984 with No. 11837 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Writ Petition (C) No. 13380 of 1984
1.  The petitioner-Society was registered under Section 3-A (as applicable to the State of U.P.) of the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The Certificate of Registration granted to the Society expired in October 1983. The petitioner applied for the renewal of the Certificate of Registration. Since no action was taken on the application the petitioner approached this Court by way of this writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. It is not disputed by the learned counsel for the parties that the matter regarding renewal of the Certificate of Registration is still pending consideration before the Registrar of Societies, State of U.P.
2.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Although various questions regarding the eligibility of the petitioner-Society to run the educational institutions have been raised in these proceedings but it is not necessary for us to go into the same. We are of the view that the Registrar of the Societies was under a statutory obligation to decide the application filed by the Society for renewal of the registration certificate.
3.   We direct the respondent-Registrar Firms, Societies and Chits, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow to decide the application of the petitioners within three months from today after hearing the petitioner. The petitioner-Society through its representative shall appear before the Registrar on December 16, 1992. The Registrar shall pass a speaking order dealing with all the points raised by the parties. The writ petition is disposed of accordingly. Copy of this order be sent to the Registrar, Societies, State of U.P.
Writ Petition (C) No. 11837 of 1985
4.  The writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
