Thakur Bhagat Singh v State of Madhya Pradesh and others
Supreme Court of India

17 January 2005
C.A. No. 373 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 507 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted. Heard learned counsel appearing for the parties.
1.  This appeal has been preferred against the order dated 3-9-2002, by which the review petition preferred before the High Court has been dismissed only on the ground of delay. The contents of the impugned order itself show that the petitioner claims to have acquired knowledge on 22-6-2002, of the order of which review was sought.
2.  The review petition was filed on 22-7-2002. The review petition was thus within limitation from the date of deriving knowledge of the order. That apart, we are informed that the other review petition being MCC No. 289 of 1999, in common subject matter tiled at the instance of other awardees is already under consideration before the High Court.
3. Under these circumstances, we allow this appeal and send back the matter to the High Court to decide the review petition on merits along with the connected matters.
Appeal allowed.
