Messrs Shah Nursing Home and Poly Clinic P.Ltd v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 April 2001
Review Petition(Civil) No.366/2001 in S.L.P.(Civil)No.21494/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The contention urged in support of the review petition is that the objections filed under Order XXI Rule 58 CPC before the Competent Authority would not be considered in view of the judgment sought to be reviewed.
We find absolutely no justification for this plea. Inasmuch as neither in the order of the High Court under challenge nor in the order of this Court, sought to be reviewed, there is anything which prevents the Competent Authority from considering the objections.
2. We, therefore, find no merit in the review petition. It is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
