Ponnuswamy v State
Supreme Court of India

18 January 1995
Cr.A. No. 442 of 1988, Dt. 18 January 1995.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The verdict of the three Courts below is similar in convicting and keeping maintained the convictions of the appellant under Sections 489-B and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The case of the prosecution against the appellant is that he had purchased paddy from a peasant on payment of 130 forged currency notes of Rs. 100/- denomination.
2. On the arrest of the appellant, further forged currency notes were alleged to have been found in his possession for which he had to face a trial separately. All the same, the appellant had no explanation to offer as to wherefrom had he obtained those forged currency notes. Silence on the part of the appellant in such circumstances would by itself be a telling circumstance which would weigh against him in the consideration of the prosecution evidence led against him.
3.  In these circumstances, we are of the view that the convictions recorded deserve no alteration and equally there is no scope for reduction of sentence.
4.  Maintaining the convictions and sentences of the appellant, we dismiss this appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
