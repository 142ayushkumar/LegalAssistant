Indamar Company v U. O. I. and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 August 2001
C.A. No. 9519 of 1995 with C.A. Nos. 9721-22 of 1995.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals arise out of a common judgment of the division bench of the High Court of judicature at Bombay in W.A. Nos. 412/1990, 477/1990 and 478/1990 dated 22.6.1995. To appreciate the facts in these cases, we shall refer to the facts in civil appeal No. 9519 of 1995.
2.  The appellant is a lessee of National Airport Authority of India in respect of a hanger at Civil Aerodrome at Juhu, Santacruz-Bombay. The lease amount payable by the appellant was increased from time to time between April, 1973 and November, 1988. The appellant challenged the increase of rent in writ petition No. 2219/86 in the High Court of Bombay which was dismissed on February, 28, 1990.
3. That order was unsuccessfully assailed in W.A. No. 412 of 1990 before the division bench of the High Court. By a common order dated June 22, 1995 the High Court disposed of writ appeal Nos. 412 of 1990, 477 of 1990 and 478 of 1990 from which the present appeals arise.
4.  It is now brought to our notice that insofar as the increase of rent/licence fees for the period subsequent to filing of the writ petition, namely, after 3.9.1986 is concerned, the appellants initiated proceedings in the High Court under Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. In view of this Mr. K. K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel submits that the appellants seek permission to withdraw the appeals, with liberty to pursue the arbitration proceedings with regard to increase in the rent/licence fees after 3.9.1986.
Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals as withdrawn. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
