Chaman Lal v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 December 1991
C.A. No. 2471 of 1982
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is not in dispute that the police under the U.P. Police Regulation has opened a 'History Sheet' against the appellant. Challenging the validity of maintaining the History Sheet, the appellant moved the High Court for relief. The High Court has rejected his writ petition. In this appeal, it is contended that maintaining the History Sheet against the appellant does not fall within the paragraph 228 of the UP Police Regulations.
2.   We have perused the said paragraph and also the provisions of paragraph 240. We have also considered the facts and circumstances of the case. We are of the opinion that no interference is called for in this case.
3.  However, it is open to the appellant to make representation to the District Superintendent of Police to close the History Sheet on the ground that nothing has been alleged or attributed against him since then. If any such representation is made, the Superintendent of Police shall consider it according to law and make appropriate order. With these observations, the appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
