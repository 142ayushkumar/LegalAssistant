D. Puttaswamy v K. Venkataramanaegowda and Another
Supreme Court of India

10 January 2002
C.A. No. 3882 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This Court by its order dated 20-7-1999, directed the Principal Civil Judge's Court at Srirangapatna to dispose of the suit within a year from the date of this Court's order.
2.  Subsequently, however, records depict that the Principal Civil Judge has sent letters dated 16-8-2000, 21-12-2000 and 23-7-2001 for extensions of time so as to enable him to dispose of the suit. The Principal Civil Judge has again sent a letter dated 8-11-2001, requesting extension of time for disposal of the suit till April 2002.
3. We are at a loss to appreciate the further extension of time in the matter. Be that as it may and since the Principal Civil Judge has prayed for further extension of time, we deem it fit to grant extension in the interest of justice till June 2002. This would, however, be the last extension and the parties are directed to render all possible cooperation and assistance for expeditious disposal of the matter before the learned Judge.
4.  The Registrar General of the Karnataka High Court is, however, directed to keep a track of the matter and intimate to the Registry of this Court due compliance with this order.
5.  The Registry is directed to send a copy of this order to the Registrar General of the Karnataka High Court. The office report dated 5-12-2001 stands disposed of as above.
Order accordingly.
