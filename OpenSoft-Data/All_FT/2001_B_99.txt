Baljinder Singh and Others v Balwant Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8288/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
Permission to file SLP granted.
1.  It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that under the Rules there could not have been allotment of land of more than 10 acres and further the land which was reserved for the Scheduled Castes has been given to the General Candidates. It is also contended that the de-reservation of the land was contrary to the Rules. We find from the judgment of the High Court that the petitioners have already made a representation to the Deputy Commissioner in this regard. We, therefore, direct the Deputy Commissioner to consider and dispose of the matters in accordance with law within six weeks from the date on which certified copy of this order is served on him.
2. Lastly, it is also contended that the petitioners have already sown the crop and the same is standing on the disputed land and the petitioners be permitted to cut the crop only after depositing half of the bid amount, namely, Rs.4,000/- per acre. The Deputy Commissioner shall also consider this aspect of the matter while deciding the representation.
With the above observations, the special leave petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
