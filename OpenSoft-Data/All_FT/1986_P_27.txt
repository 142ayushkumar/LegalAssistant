President Association Of Allottees Of Requisition Premises Bombay v State Of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

23 September 1986
Writ Petition (civil)  404 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  The writ petition is adjourned to December 16, 1986 to enable the State of Maharashtra to put forward a definite scheme for construction of houses for government servants who are sought to be displaced as a result of the de-requisitioning the premises which were earlier requisitioned for housing government servants. Keeping in view the extended period of requisition, we would impress upon the State Government that it should be the obligation of the government to provide housing accommodation to the government servants because a rood over the head is an absolute requirement and the government should be able to provide it. We do not see any reason why the State Government should not be in a position to come out with a phased programme for construction of houses for government servants. Meanwhile, interim orders shall continue
2.  We may also make it clear that if any retired government servant or relative of the deceased government servant are required to vacate the premises, the High Court will give them six months time for that purpose. The affidavit dated September 22, 1986 filed by the State Government is taken on record.
