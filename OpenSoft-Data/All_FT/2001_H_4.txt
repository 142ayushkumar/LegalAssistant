H. Ramegowda(Dead) By Lrs v Chowdamma and Anr
Supreme Court of India

2 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8864/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  On May 10, 2000 when the matter came up for preliminary hearing, this Court issued a notice to the respondents to show cause as to why the order made by the High Court should not be set aside and the matter be remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration. We have carefully considered the order made by the High Court and we find that there is no due consideration of the matter by the High Court in terms of Section 100 of Civil Procedure Code.
2. In the circumstances we set aside the order made by the High Court and remit the same to the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
