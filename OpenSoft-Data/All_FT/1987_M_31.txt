Madan Mohan Singh v Harbans Lal
Supreme Court of India

26 March 1987
C.A. No. 3151 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are inclined to the view that the High Court was not right in its interpretation of Section 13(2)(1) of the Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction Act), 1973. The default spoken of in clause (1) of Section 13(2) of the Act is only of "arrears of rent" and it does not provide that the tenant must in addition, also tender the electricity charges due. While the electricity charges would always be in addition to the rent and payable by the tenant it may or may not form part of the rent. It appears that the electricity charges were not fixed between the parties and therefore the tender made by the tenant on the first date of the hearing could not be held to be invalid on that account.
2.   In view of this, the judgment of the High Court as well as the order of the Rent Controller are set aside and the application for eviction will stand rejected. We, however, direct that in view of the spiral rise in the providing rents the appellant shall pay Rs. 330 per month as rent for the demised premises w.e.f. April 1, 1987. The learned counsel for the appellant agrees to this increases. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
