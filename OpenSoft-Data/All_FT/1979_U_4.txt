Umedmal and another v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

15 February 1979
Cr.As. Nos. 360 and 386 of 1975, Dt. 15 February 1979.
The Judgment was delivered by: FAZAL ALI, J.
1.  These appeals have been pressed by the counsel for the appellant on the question of sentence only. Having regard to the very marginal nature of the adulteration found by the Public Analyst, we think there is sufficient room for reduction in the sentence of the appellants.
2. In peculiar facts and circumstances of these cases, therefore, while upholding the conviction, we reduce the sentence of both the appellants to the period already served maintaining the fine imposed by the trial Court. With this modification, the appeals are dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
