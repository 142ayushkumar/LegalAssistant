Anshuman Shukia v Oriental Insurance Company Limited
Supreme Court of India

6 February 2004
C.A. No. 842 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In the impugned order, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has not considered the real issue that arose for consideration and the National Commission proceeded as if the subject matter related to vacating the premises, but, the real controversy is different, as is evident from the records and the contentions raised by the parties.
2. In this view, it is appropriate that the National Commission examines the matter afresh in the light of the contentions raised.
3.  The appeal is allowed, the impugned order is set aside and the matter is remitted to the National Commission for fresh disposal in the light of what is stated above. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
