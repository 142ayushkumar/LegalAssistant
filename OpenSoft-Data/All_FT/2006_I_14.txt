In Re : Illegal Detention of Machal Lalung
Supreme Court of India

7 August 2006
W.P. (Cr.) No. 296 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Learned counsel appearing for the State of Assam submits that actual payment has been made and is being made to Machal Lalung.
2. We have perused the joint preliminary inquiry report conducted on the direction of this Court by the Registrar General of the Gauhati High Court and the Commissioner and Secretary, Finance Department, Government of Assam. The report shows how for number of years none examined the position of Machal Lalung. There are various gaps mentioned in the report. There is another case from the State of Uttar Pradesh [Writ Petition (Crl.) No.18 of 2006], which this Court is seized of. In that case, the concerned person had to remain in the mental hospital for thirty seven years. The file of the said case has not been sent to this Court, presumably, for the reason that the report from the concerned mental hospital has not been received.
3. List both the petitions together on a non-miscellaneous day so that after hearing learned counsel, appropriate directions can be issued. The petition is adjourned for six weeks.
Order accordingly
