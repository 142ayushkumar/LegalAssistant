Supreme Court of India

15 July 2003
C.As. (S) Nos. 4938-52 of 1993 with W.P. (C) No. ... of 1992 (CC No. 16817)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Question involved in these matters is with regard to the interpretation of the provisions of Section 77 of the Madhya Pradesh Town Improvement Trust Act, 1960 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") which provides for payment of solatium @ 15% and interest @ 6%. It has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant that the Act nowhere refers to the provision of the Land Acquisition Act and land acquisition is neither incorporated either by reference or by specific provision.
2. He, therefore, submits that the decision rendered by this Court in the case of Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vasantrao (2002) 7 SCC 657 2002 Indlaw SC 1152 would not be applicable. He relies heavily on the judgment rendered by this Court in Prakash Amichand Shah v. State of Gujarat (1986) 1 SCC 581 1985 Indlaw SC 367 and judgments rendered by this Court in Union of India v. Karam Singh (1997) 5 SCC 180 1997 Indlaw SC 932 wherein the Court has refused to grant solatium and interest in a decision arising out of the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952 and in Union of India v. Ajaib Singh (1995) 6 SCC 323 : AIR 1996 SC 270 1995 Indlaw SC 1256.
3.  As against this, learned counsel for the respondent submits that if solatium @ 30% and interest as provided under the Land Acquisition Act is not granted the provision of Section 77 of the Madhya Pradesh Town Improvement Trust Act would be violative of Article 14 as held by this Court in Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao (1973) 1 SCC 500 1972 Indlaw SC 421.
4.  Considering the important question of law involved, we think that this matter requires to be decided by a larger Bench. Hence this matter be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for placing the same before a three-Judge Bench.
Order accordingly.
