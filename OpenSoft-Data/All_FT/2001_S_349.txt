Siya Devi v Srikant Das and Anr
Supreme Court of India

5 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 604/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard the learned counsel appearing for the informant and Mr. B.B. Singh, learned counsel appearing for the State.
2.  Though, we find sufficient force in the contention of the counsel appearing for the State as well as the petitioner that in the case in hand, the High Court ought not to have released the accused on bail. But, having regard to the fact that more than nine months have elapsed from the date of the 2 release and as on today, we are not inclined to cancel the bail that has already been granted.
3. It is stated before us that the accused has misutilised the liberty that has been granted and several complaints have been made. If that be so, it would be more appropriate both for the State as well as the informant to move the concerned High Court for cancellation of bail and, on such an application being moved, the High Court would deal with the matter, in accordance with law.
This special leave petition stands disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
