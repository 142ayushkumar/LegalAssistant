Suchitra Nag v Commissioner Sanchaita Investments
Supreme Court of India

10 March 1995
Appeal (Civil) No. 3982 of 1995
1. Leave granted.
2. The appellant had filed objections against the impugned order of the Division Bench of the High Court dated July 21, 1994 rendered in matter No. 4134/90. The appellant claimed that she is the owner of the property bearing No. 4F, Nabarog Samabaya Abasan Ltd., 15, Mayfair Road, Calcutta - 700019. She claimed that the said property is not liable for attach-ment and she had no connection with Sanchaita Investments or any of its partners or agents or sub-agents. She purports to set up her own inde-pendent right, title and interest in the said flat de hors her husband.
3. From the judgment it would appear that the Division Bench had not considered the case set up by her. It mainly considered the case of her husband who had denied the liability and held him liable to the amount claimed by the respondent.
Accordingly the decree as passed by the trial court was affirmed. While affirming the decree, it would appear that the claim set up by the appellant did not appear to have been adverted to. While dismissing the appeal, there was mention that it was disposed of in terms of the order passed in the appeal of her husband.
4. Under these circumstances, we think that it would be proper to remit the matter to the High Court to consider the purported claim of the appellant with regard to the said flat and to proceed according to law. The appeal is accordingly allowed, by setting aside the order of the Division Bench insofar as it relates to the appellant. The High Court is requested to consider and dispose of the objections according to law expeditiously.
Appeal allowed
