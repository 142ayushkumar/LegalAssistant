G. Ramachandran v K. Mohan
Supreme Court of India

11 October 1999
IA No. 1 in C.A. No. 2663 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  A very distressing episode happened inside the four walls of a courtroom when one advocate slapped on the cheek of another advocate. The State Bar Council initiated action against the delinquent advocate, K. Mohan (respondent in this appeal) and he was debarred from practising as an advocate for a period of five years by way of punishment. When he filed an appeal before the Bar Council of India, the said punishment was annulled by the impugned order.
2.  While this appeal was pending in this Court, the respondent expressed remorse for the criminal act perpetrated by him in open court. He has now tendered an unconditional apology to the appellant which he had also put in writing. Learned counsel for the appellant (the victim advocate), submitted that the appellant has accepted the apology and requested that it may go on record. We record it.
3.  We direct the respondent to file a copy of this written apology with the Court before which he committed the aforesaid criminal act and another copy to be filed with the State Bar Council and a third copy with the President of the Bar Association, Gudiyatham. His right to practise will resume only on completing the aforesaid directions.
4. In view of this changed situation, we dispose of this appeal. A copy of the order shall be sent to the District Judge, N.A.A. District (Tamil Nadu) for circulation to all the courts within his district for information.
Appeal disposed of.
