Commissioner of Income Tax and Another v Morgenstern Werner
Supreme Court of India

24 October 2002
C.A. No. 1152 of 1999 (Arising as an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 22 July 1998, of the Allahabad High Court in C.M.W.P. No. 536 of 1994).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. The High Court has given a specific finding that the respondent-assessee had not stayed in India during the preceding nine years and he was not ordinarily resident in India, and, therefore, he would be governed by the proviso to section 5(1)(c) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
3. Admittedly, the assessee was a technician working with Kraft Work Union (Siemens) and was drawing his salary in Germany. Hence, he was not taxable in India and, therefore, his salary could not be included in the total income to be assessed in India. He was deputed by his company as a technical liaison officer to provide technical guidance to Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. for which he was paid Rs. 500 as daily allowance. The said allowance was exempt from income-tax as per the notification dated February 21, 1989. This being a finding of fact does not call for any interference in this appeal.
4. Hence, this appeal is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
