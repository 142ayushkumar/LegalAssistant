All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam v Chief Election Commissioner and Anr
Supreme Court of India

23 April 2001
I.A. Nos. 1-2 in & Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...CC2824-2825/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Permission to file S.L.P. is granted.
1.  We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. We do not understand the impugned judgment to mean that the law declared in A.C. Jose Vs. Sivan Pillai and Ors, is incorrect.
2. 
The observations made in the impugned judgment are clear. Articles 326 and 327 cannot be so interpreted as to enable the taking away the jurisdiction or to abridge the powers of the Election Commission under Article 324.
3.  A.C. Jose's case does not apply to the facts of the present case for the simple reason that in A.C. Jose's case, it was by an Executive order that Electronic Voting Machines were sought to be used which was not permissible being contrary to the Rules.
4.  Now that Section 61A has been inserted in the Representation of the People Act, 1951 in 1989, the aforesaid decision cannot be of any assistance to the petitioner.
5.  While considering the validity of the said Section, we are in agreement with the decision of the High Court that the said Section is valid. The Special Leave petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
