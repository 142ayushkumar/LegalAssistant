Bhaylubhai Chimanbhai Kukana v State of Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

4 December 2000
Cr.A. No. 1051 of 2000.
The Order of the case was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant has been convicted under Section 302 IPC and has been imprisoned for life for having killed his wife by strangulation. Against his conviction and sentence, the appellant preferred an appeal and the appeal has been disposed of by the High Court without examining the evidence on record by a very cryptic order, which cannot be held to be an order of the appellate court in accordance with law.
2. In this view of the matter and having heard Mr Muralidhar, learned counsel for the appellant and learned counsel appearing for the State, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and direct that the High Court would do well in disposing of Criminal Appeal No. 342 of 1998 within a period of three months from today.
This appeal stands allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
