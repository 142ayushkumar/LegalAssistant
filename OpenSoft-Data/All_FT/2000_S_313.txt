Mahender Singh v State of Andhra Pradesh and Another
Supreme Court of India

10  May  2000
Cr.A. No. 478 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This is a case in which the appellant was convicted under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, by the lower court and was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a period of one year and to pay a fine of Rs.3,09,700, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of four months. Though the conviction and sentence were confirmed by the Sessions Judge, the High Court reduced the sentence to imprisonment for three months and the fine to Rs.5,000.
2.  We are now told that the dispute regarding the cheque amount has been settled between the appellant and the payee-complainant. Learned counsel appearing for the second respondent-complainant has confirmed the fact that the grievance of the complainant-payee has been completely redressed and therefore he has no objection in giving any relief to the appellant. However, as the offence has been proved, we have to maintain the conviction.
3. In view of the subsequent development including redressal of the grievance of the payee, we are inclined to save the appellant from any further jail sentence. We, therefore, reduce the sentence of imprisonment to the period he had already undergone. However, we maintain the fine sentence of Rs.5,000 undisturbed.
Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
