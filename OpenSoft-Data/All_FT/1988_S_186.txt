Ram Chandra Yadav v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 March 1988
C.A. No. 818 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Special leave granted. Heard both sides. We feel that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the order of dismissal from service passed against the appellant deserves to be set aside. We accordingly direct the reinstatement of the appellant in service with effect from March 15, 1988.
We further direct that the interregnum between the date of dismissal and the date of reinstatement will not be treated as a break and appellant will be treated as having continued in service for all purpose except for the purpose of back wages.
2.   In other words the appellant will not be entitled to back wages for the interregnum in view of the circumstances of the case and the fact that appellant approached the court after considerable time lag. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
