Gujarat Ambuja Cements Limited v Chavi Raj Singh and others
Supreme Court of India

21 April 2005
S.L.P. (C) No. ... of 2005 (CC No. 4575 of 2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  The objection of the petitioner is to the direction of the High Court that the petitioner shall foot the medical expenses of all the persons who are suffering from asthma and TB in the ten villages. That order was made on a statement made by counsel for the writ petitioner in a public interest petition that about ten villages of one panchayat have a number of asthma and TB patients which is attributable to pollution of air by loading and unloading of coal. The order was made on 8-10-2004. On a query as to the number of persons who are suffering from the ailment abovementioned, learned counsel submits that that exercise has not been conducted.
2. Let the petitioner conduct the said exercise, find out the number of persons suffering from the ailment and, in case there is any difficulty in compliance with the order of the High Court, it may move an appropriate application before the High Court, which would consider it on its own merits. In view of the aforesaid, we are of the view that no interference is called for. The special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
