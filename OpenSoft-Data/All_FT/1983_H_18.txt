Heels Shoe Company v Mrs. Mumtaz Begum
Supreme Court of India

25 February 1983
C.A. No. 2995 of 1983 (Arising as an appeal by special from the Judgment and Order Dt. 9 December 1982 of the Madras High Court in C.R.P. No. 4599 of 1981).
The judgement of the Court was delivered by: Chinnappa Reddy, J.
1. Special leave petition is granted.
2. The tenant of Shop No. 7 in 148, Pantheon Road, Egmore, whose eviction from the premises has been ordered on the ground of 'wilful default' is the appellant in this appeal. We do not think it necessary to narrate the events leading up to the filing of the petition for eviction. Those facts have been set out in the judgment of the Appellate Bench of the Court of Small Causes in detail. We are satisfied that on the facts and circumstances of this case, there has been no wilful default, though default there might have been.
3. We, therefore, set aside order of the Subordinate Tribunals and dismiss the petition for eviction. But we make it a condition that the petitioner should deposit a sum of Rs 5175 representing the arrears of rent up to December 31, 1982 in the trial court within six weeks from today. We also make it a condition that the rent for the months of January and February 1983 should be deposited before March 15, 1983, and thereafter the monthly rent should be paid before the fifteenth of the succeeding month. We further make it a condition that the petitioner should deposit in the trial court an amount representing six months' rent by way of advance within six weeks from today. All amounts deposited may be drawn out by the respondent-landlady. Subject to these conditions, the appeal is allowed. There will be no order regarding costs.
Appeal allowed.
