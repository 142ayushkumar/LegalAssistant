Pratap Singh Chautala v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

12  May  2008
Appeal (civil) 3551 of 2008[Arising out of SLP(C) No. 16620/2005]
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case and despite limited notice as to the amount of costs having been issued, interest of justice would be subserved if the State of Haryana is asked to transfer the sum of Rs.30,000/- to the Haryana State Legal Services Authority, if the same has been deposited with it. We direct accordingly.
3. We appreciate the stand taken by the learned counsel for the State that in a case of this nature, instead of the State deriving the benefit of costs awarded, the costs, if deposited, should be expended for a better cause.
4. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of
