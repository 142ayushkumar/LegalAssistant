Chariot Cement Company v Cce and C and Another
Supreme Court of India

28 February 2002
S.L.P. to Appeal (Civil) Nos. 4965-4966/2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Taken on board.
1.  The grievance of the petitioner is that the High Court did not consider the hardship while enforcing the provisions of Section 35F of the Central Excise Act, 1944. The aforesaid provision states that until and unless the demand is paid, the appeal will not be entertained for being disposed of. By the impugned order the High Court has granted time till 17/2/2002 to make the deposit of Rs. 30 lacs, which was further extended by the High Court till 28/2/2002. It is stated by the learned counsel that out of the aforesaid sum, Rs. 6 lacs have already been paid.
2.  While, therefore, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court. We modify the order and extend the time with the direction that out of the balance Rs. 24 lacs, the petitioner shall deposit a sum of Rs. 12 lacs on or before 31st March, 2002 and another Rs. 12 lacs on or before 15th April, 2002. On such deposit being made the appeal shall be entertained to be disposed of.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
