Anil Sharm v Ashish and Anr
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17876/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This is a plaintiff's appeal. The plaintiff-appellant herein filed a suit for specific performance of an agreement dated 22.6.1995 and for permanent injunction before the District Judge, Indore, Madhya Pradesh. The said suit was dismissed in default. The appellant thereafter preferred a First Appeal before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh. The High Court by the impugned judgment summarily dismissed the First Appeal without giving any reasons. It is against the said judgment of the High Court the appellant has preferred this appeal by way of special leave petition.
2.  We have heard counsel for the parties. This Court, on more than one occasions, has expressed the view that the High Court while dismissing the matter is required to give reasons, however, brief it may be. Without reasons the appellate Court is unable to find out as to which ground has prevailed upon the High Court which has resulted in dismissal of the appeal. Curiously it was appellant's first appeal and it was required to be dealt with in the manner known to law. On this short ground the judgment under challenge deserves to be set aside.
3.  This Court while entertaining the special leave petition issued notice limited to the question as to why the case may not be remanded to the trial court. We feel that this matter instead of sending back to the trial court is required to be remanded to the High Court.
4. We, therefore, in modification of the order dated 13.11.2000 set aside the judgment under challenge and send the matter back to the High Court to be decided on merits and in conformity with law.However, we make it clear that the appellant shall not take unnecessary adjournment in the matter.
5.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
