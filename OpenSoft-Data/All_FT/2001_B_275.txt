Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16760/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that in the facts of the present case the High Court ought to have stayed execution of the decree against the appellants herein.
2. Without expressing any opinion or giving any reason in respect thereof, because that may prejudice the parties in the appeal which is pending, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned order of the High Court and direct that pending hearing of F.A. No. 80 of 2000, there will be stay of execution proceedings against the appellants.
3.  The High Court should dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as possible.
Appeal allowed.
