Land Acquisitn.Officer and Spl.Dy.Collector v Kerla Veeraraghava Rao
Supreme Court of India

11  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)......./2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are considered that in most of the land acquisition matters reaching this court from the State of A.P. the delay ranges to very inordinate period in filing special leave petitions. Invariably the blame is put on the Law Officers of the State or functioning of their department but so far we are not informed of any action taken against any such delinquent officers who caused so much of delay while dealing with public money.Application for condonation of delay is dismissed.
2.  Consequently, this Special Leave Petition is dismissed with the above observations, so that in future any such petition can be filed only supported by documents showing the action taken against the delinquent officer(s).
3. Value of the acquired land fixed by the High Court cannot be treated as approved by this court.
Petition dismissed.
