Vithoba Deo Gar v Tarabai and Anr
Supreme Court of India

30 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19644/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Application for substitution is ordered.
1.  There is a delay of 717 days in filing this special leave petition which is directed against the judgment and order of the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay in Second Appeal No.610/1998 dated December 8, 1998.In the affidavit filed in support of I.A.No.2 of 1999, in para II, it is stated that the 2 certified copy of the order was applied for before 16.1.1999 but was not yet made ready. This application was signed on April 29, 1999. However, later in I.A.No.5 of 2001 which was supported by the affidavit of the advocate Mr.Narayan K.Iyer, it is stated on oath that he has sent the certified copy to the concerned advocate in the month of April, 1999.
2. In view of these two contradictory statements and on the facts of this case, we are not satisfied that the delay in filing of this S.L.P. has been properly explained. On the contrary, the petitioners have tried to make out a false case to seek the condonation of delay. There is no cause let alone sufficient cause to condone inordinate delay of 717 days. The application for condonation of delay is therefore dismissed. Consequently, the special leave petition is also dismissed.
3.  No sufficient cause has been shown to condone exorbitant delay of 1952 days in filing of this S.L.P.
4.  The application for condonation of delay is therefore dismissed. Consequently, the special leave petition is also dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
