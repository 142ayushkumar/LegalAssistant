The Judgment was delivered by: N. P. SINGH, J.
Leave granted.
1.  On behalf of the appellant-society, it was pointed out that in these cases, the appellant-society had not entered into any agreement with any agent or contractor as had been done in other cases referred to above. It was also pointed out that some of the landlords in the present case had filed writ applications, which had been dismissed by the High Court. Special leave petitions against the order of the High Court have also been dismissed by this Court.
It was urged that in this background the High Court should not have quashed the notifications under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, so far the acquisition for the appellant-society is concerned. The stand taken on behalf of the appellants, is these appeals was challenged on behalf of the respondents.
2.   The special feature of the present case as already pointed out above is that the appellant-society had not entered into any agreement, with any agent or contractor to get the lands acquired. It was not stated that there was no prior approval of the appropriate Government to the scheme in question. According to us, the facts of the present case are different from the others, which have been disposed of by this Court. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed and the judgment of the High Court so ar it relates to the appellant-society, is set aside. No costs.
Appeals allowed.
