P. S. Ramakrishna Reddy and Another v Authorised Officer, Land Reforms, Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

15 July 2008
Civil Appeal Nos. 3888-3889 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  These appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated 7th of December, 1999 passed by the High Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in Civil Revision Petition Nos.1662 and 1663 of 1995.
2.  The High Court, while dismissing the civil revision case, solely relied on a decision of the Division Bench of that High Court, namely, U. Sarat Kumar vs. Authorised Officer, Land Reforms reported in 1998 (1) A.L.T. 496. The aforesaid decision of the High Court in U.Sarat Kumar's case has been affirmed by this Court in the case of Makineni Venkata Sujatha vs. Land Reforms Tribunal & Anr. reported in 2000 (8) SCC 196 2000 Indlaw SC 2649.
3. Since the question raised before the High Court as well as before us is now covered by the aforesaid decision of this Court reported in 2000 (8) SCC 196 2000 Indlaw SC 2649, there is no question to interfere with the impugned judgment.
4.  Accordingly, the appeals are dismissed with no order as to costs. The interim order, if any, stands vacated. The lower court record if lying in this Registry, the same may be sent back at an early date.
Appeals dismissed
