Rajesh Kumar v Institution of Engineers (India)
Supreme Court of India

20 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14131/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The High Court in this case has proceeded on the assumption, as is evident from the decision of the Single Judge as well as of the Division Bench, that there is no Rule for awarding grace marks. In the affidavit-in-reply filed in this Court, it has been stated that there is a Rule with regard to grace marks which was first introduced in 1962 and has subsequently been revised by a Resolution passed in 1990.
2.  This fact should have been brought to the notice of the High Court and the High Court should have applied its mind & examined whether any benefit can be granted to the appellant.
3.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and remand the case back to the High Court for a fresh decision keeping in view the affidavit- in-reply filed in this Court. The respondent shall place before the High Court the relevant Rules pertaining to granting of grace marks.
Appeal allowed.
