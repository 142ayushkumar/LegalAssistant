Podipireddy Atchuta Desai v Chinnam Joga Rao and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 February 1987
C.A. No. 8589 (NCE) of 1983
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The questions raised in this election appeal are of some importance. We also see the force of the submissions urged on behalf of the appellant. All the same, having regard to the fact that fresh elections have already taken place and the appeal has become redundant in that sense, we will be undertaking a futile exercise if we examine the validity or otherwise of the view taken by the High Court in dismissing the election petition.
2. Under the circumstances without expressing any view, one way or the other, on the validity or otherwise of the decision of the High Court, we direct that this appeal shall stand disposed of with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
