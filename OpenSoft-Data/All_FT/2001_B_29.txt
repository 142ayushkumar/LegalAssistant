B.L. Nagi Reddy v B.L. Pakkiranna (D) By Lrs
Supreme Court of India

5 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15944/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Upon hearing the submissions made on behalf of the parties, we do feel it expedient to record that the dismissal of the review application against the grant of interest 12% cannot be said to be justified in any way, more so by reason of the fact that the High Court had itself granted interest at 12% on the decretal amount in the appeal filed by the appellant. The High Court has also erred in allowing the application, as regards the payment of interest filed by the respondent herein.
2. The impugned orders, thus, stand set aside. The appellant would be entitled to an interest 12% from the date of decree till the date of payment.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
