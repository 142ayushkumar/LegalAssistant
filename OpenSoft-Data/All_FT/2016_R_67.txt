(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. Heard the learned counsel on both sides.
3. At paragraph 105 of the impugned Judgment, the High Court has rendered the following findings :-
"......as a matter of fact, question of awarding compensation, in respect of land acquired under same acquisition notifications, which were subject matter of several other LARs and came to be decided by another Court determining market value of Rs. 65/- per sq. yard, has attained finality after dismissal of those appeals by this Court as well as Supreme Court......"
4. In view of such categorical finding, we do not find any justification for the High Court to remand the matter to the Reference Court for fresh consideration. Accordingly, the appeals are allowed.
The market value is fixed at Rs. 65/- per sq. yard. Beside the market value, the appellants shall also be entitled to all the statutory benefits.
No costs.
