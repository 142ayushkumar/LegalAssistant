Balwan and Others v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

2 February 1983
Cr.A. No. 404 of 1976 (Arising as an appeal by special leave From the Judgment and Order Dt. 25 February 1976 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Cr.A. No. 468 of 1975).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this appeal the appellants have been convicted under Section 148, 307/149, 326/149, 325/149, 324/149, and 323/149, I.P.C., 1860, to various terms of imprisonment ranging from one year to five years' rigorous imprisonment.
2.  It is common ground that the appellants have already served a little more than 2 1/2 years in jail and they were released on bail in 1976. After lapse of such a long time and having regard to the nature of injuries received by the injured persons and in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we do not think that it is expedient in the interests of justice to send them back to jail.
3.  In these circumstances, while upholding the conviction of the appellants we reduce the sentence of the appellants to the period already served by them on the various counts.
The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
