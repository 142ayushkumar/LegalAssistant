All India Harijan League Through Om Prakash Shukla, General Secretary v N. D. M. C
Supreme Court of India

3 August 1987
W.P. No. 1743 of 1986 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is a petition to ensure the purity and sanctity of the temple of Valmiki in the Mandir Marg, New Delhi. It has been alleged that the NDMC is using the premises adjacent to this temple as a workshop and also a garbage disposal centre. Learned counsel appearing for NDMC assures us that it would not be used as a garbage disposal centre but he submits before this Court that the workshop in question is existing over 30 years and there is no other suitable place where it can be conveniently shifted without causing public inconvenience. It appears that his workshop had existed from 1933 according to NDMC and according to the petitioner from 1957. Be that as it may, the proper order in the interest of justice would be to direct NDMC to ensure that this place should be so maintained properly in consistence with the sanctity of the temple of Valmiki. It is not in any way disputed that the are in question is of sanctity and of dignity for the temple of Valmiki and the NDMC should see that the place is so maintained and should not be used as a garbage disposal centre.
2.   We further direct that the NDMC will take steps to make the place beautiful as soon as possible. In this connection the petitioner will make further suggestion to the NDMC and if such suggestion is made the NDMC will consider the same in proper spirit and except removal of the workshop for the present will take all the steps to maintain the sanctity and dignity of the place, as a place of pilgrimage being in the vicinity of the temple of Valmiki. The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
