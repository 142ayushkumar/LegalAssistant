1.  In this appeal a 2-Judge Bench of this Court by its Order dated 11th November, 2003 has referred this appeal directly to be heard by a 5-Judge Bench without first referring the same to a 3-Judge Bench.
2. This Court in the case of Pradip Chandra Parija and others v. Pramod Chandra Patnaik and others2001 Indlaw SC 21248 has held, such a procedure cannot be followed by 2-Judge Bench.
3.  That apart, while referring the matter it is not even indicated that any issue requiring the interpretation of the Constitution as contemplated under Article 145(3) of the Constitution arises in this appeal.
