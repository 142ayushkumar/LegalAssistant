Prabhu Dayal Agarwal and others v Murari Lal Agarwal
Supreme Court of India

27 January 1981
Cr.A. No. 67 of 1981
The Judgment was delivered by: Tulzapurkar, J.
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing counsel on either side we are satisfied that this is not a case where a charge against the appellants for unlawful assembly and rioting could be framed. If at all the appellants could be charged for the individual acts and if material warrants S. 34 might be invoked.
Accordingly the charge framed by the Magistrate is set aside and the matter is remanded to the Magistrate concerned to frame a proper charge.
Order accordingly.
