Supreme Court of India

21 November 2002
C.A. No. 3634 of 2000 (Arising as an appeal From 2002 (147) E.L.T. 1069 (Tribunal); 2003 (151) E.L.T. A85 (S.C.) With C.A. Nos. 5043/2000 (Arising as an appeal From 2000 (115) E.L.T. 668 (Tribunal)) and 4042/2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The Tribunal allowed the appeal filed by the assessee by referring to its earlier decision in A/1038/99-NB(SM), dated 24-9-99 wherein it was held that press-mud would not be a marketable commodity and therefore not excisable.
Admittedly, the Department has accepted the decision rendered by the Tribunal in Shankar Sugar Mills and has not challenged the same.
2. Further, the Department has not led any evidence to establish that press-mud was in any way marketable commodity. Hence these appeals are dismissed.
There shall not be any order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
