Inder Pal Kaur and Others v State of Punjab and Anr
Supreme Court of India

9 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11964/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Substitution allowed.
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The only question raised in this appeal is that the High Court has decided the second appeal without framing any substantial question of law. The law is well settled.
2. This Court has repeatedly said, after the amendment of Section 100 CPC, that the High Court shall dispose of the second appeal only in case substantial question of law arises and decide on the said question.
3.  In the present case, we find that the High Court has set aside the judgment and decree of both the courts below without framing any substantial question of law.
4.  Accordingly, the impugned judgment is unsustainable and is hereby quashed. The case is remanded back to the High Court for deciding afresh second appeal in accordance with law, first by considering whether any substantial question of arises, if so arises, to frame the same and decide in accordance with law.
The appeal is allowed. Costs. on the parties.
Appeal allowed.
