Supreme Court of India

23 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6276-6277/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have seen the direction given by the High Court of Jharkhand in the impuged order dated 24th January, 2001 in which it is stated that the appeals will be listed for hearing soon after the paper-books are filed which were required to be filed within six weeks.
2. Inasmuch as the appeals are expected to be listed at an early date, we do not think it appropriate to interfere at this stage. We do hope that the appeals will be disposed of by the High Court within three months from the date of the communication of this order.
3. The Special Leave Petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
