State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) v Bansi Lal
Supreme Court of India

31 March 2003
Cr.A. No. 475 of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 3669 of 2002)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel on either side.
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal has been filed by making a grievance as to whether the High Court, while exercising the powers of revision under Sections 397 read with Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can entertain a new plea to consider and accord the benefit by enlarging on probation a person who is under 18 years of age as envisaged under Section 20AA of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954.
2. It is seen from the materials placed on record that immediately after the judgment of the High Court on 25.9.2000 the respondent executed surety bond in conformity with the orders of the High Court and that the period of one year of probation to which they were subjected to also expired even before this appeal came to be filed on 4.4.2002.
3.  In the light of the above we consider it inappropriate to undertake a futile exercise academically to adjudicate on the question of law as well as the grievance, sought to be ventilated. Consequently, the question of law is left open, to be urged and decided in an appropriate case. Hence, we are of the view, that it is unnecessary to decide the issues raised in this appeal, at this stage. The appeal, therefore, shall stand finally disposed of on the above terms.
Appeal disposed of.
