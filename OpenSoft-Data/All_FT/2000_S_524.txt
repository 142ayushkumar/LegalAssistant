Solomon Castro v State of Kerala and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 January 2000
Cr.A. No. 14 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In the present case it is an admitted fact that by order dated 1-3-1999 the son of the appellant was detained under the COFEPOSA Act, 1974. He submitted a representation dated 20-3-1999 through the Superintendent, Central Prison, Trivandrum. That representation was received by the detaining authority on 22-3-1999. It is submitted that on 23-3-1999 the detaining authority called for the remarks of the sponsoring authority. It is further stated that remarks of the sponsoring authority were received by the detaining authority on 9-4-1999. Subsequently, on 23-4-1999 the detaining authority prepared a reply rejecting the representation. That reply was kept by some officers on their file and it was intimated only on 28-4-1999.
2.  It has been repeatedly stated by this Court that representation of the detenu is required to be considered and disposed of as expeditiously as possible by the Government. In Rajammal v. State of T.N. 1998 Indlaw SC 1964this Court again reiterated the constitutional obligation of the Government to consider the representation forwarded by the detenu without delay and observed that even though no period is prescribed by Art. 22 of the Constitution for the decision to be taken on the representation, the words "as soon as may be" in cl. (5) of Art. 22 convey the message that the representation should be considered and disposed of at the earliest. If there is delay in considering the representation the court can consider whether the delay was occasioned due to permissible reasons or unavoidable causes.
3. In the present case there is absolutely no explanation for justifying the delay between 9-4-1999 to 23-4-1999 and thereafter till 28-4-1999. In this view of the matter, the impugned order passed by the detaining authority requires to be quashed and set aside.
4.  We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court. The order of detention is quashed and set aside and the appellant's son Benny J. Soloman is directed to be set at liberty forthwith unless required in any other case.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
