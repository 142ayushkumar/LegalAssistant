Pune Zilla K.A.S.Seva Sahakari Soc.Ltd v State of Maharashtra and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4824/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. It appears that the appellant was appointed as a sub-agent by respondent No. 2. On a writ petition filed by respondent No. 7 herein, rule was issued and by the impugned order dated 1st March, 2000 the High Court has, in view of a letter dated 17th January, 2000 written by Assistant Registrar, Co-operative Society, directed that the said respondent No. 7 was to be permitted to act as a sub-agent in place of the appellant herein.
2. We do not find any cogent reason for the High Court passing this interim order which in effect allows the writ petition which has been filed by the said respondent No.7.
3.  No reason has been given as to why the decision of respondent No. 2 in appointing the appellant herein as a sub-agent was wrong. We, however, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order, the result of which would be that the appellant herein would act as a sub-agent.
4.  With regard to the work claimed to have been performed by respondent No. 7 with regard to the stock of onion, the Division Bench of the High Court in the writ petition will decide as to whether respondent No. 7 will be entitled to any commission. The High Court should endeavour to dispose of the writ petition at an early date.
Appeal allowed.
