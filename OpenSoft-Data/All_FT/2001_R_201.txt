Commissioner of Income Tax v Ramanathapuram Distt. Co-Operative Central Bank Limited
Supreme Court of India

30 October 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
The High Court has answered against the Revenue, the following question:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Appellate Tribunal was correct in law in holding that the interest on securities, subsidies received from the Government and dividend business income of the assessee entitled to deduction under section 80P(2)(a)(i) of the Income-tax Act, 1961?"
1.  The very question was considered by this court in CIT v. Karnataka State Co-operative Apex Bank 2001 Indlaw SC 282 and the conclusion was reiterated in Mehsana District Central Co-operative Bank ltd. v. ITO 2001 Indlaw SC 20761.
2.  It is now contended on behalf of the Revenue that the decision of this court in United Commercial Bank Ltd. v. CIT 1957 Indlaw SC 164 was not considered.
3.  We do not think that it is open to the Revenue to urge, through different counsel, the same thing again and again.
We are satisfied that the answer to the question has been correctly given in the decisions aforementioned and in the order under appeal.
The civil appeals are dismissed with costs.
Appeals dismissed.
