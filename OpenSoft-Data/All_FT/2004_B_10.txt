2.  The appeal filed against the said judgment of the trial court was dismissed by the Ist Additional Sessions Judge, Bangalore and a criminal revision petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code was partly allowed by the High Court which held that the appellant should pay a fine twice the cheque amount, in default the appellant to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year. It is the said order of the High Court that is challenged in this appeal.
