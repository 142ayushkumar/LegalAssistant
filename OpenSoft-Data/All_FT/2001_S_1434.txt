Messrs National Insurance Company Limited v Surinder Prasad Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10526/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The stand of the Insurance Company is ununderstandable and cannot be appreciated also. When the vehicle number was given and the party asserted that this vehicle was insured with the petitioner Insurance Company the petitioner was not in a position to assert that this vehicle was not insured with them at all. On the contrary they expressed helplessness in finding out whether the said vehicle was insured with them or not.
2.  Such a state of affair cannot be allowed to exist with nationalised insurance companies. It is time that they must find out other facilities to know that a particular vehicle is insured with them or not. We are unable to help the Insurance Company. Insurance Company will have to dodge the claim made by the respondent.
Accordingly, Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
