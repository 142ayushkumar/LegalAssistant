Tulsi Ram v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

27 April 1981
Cr.A. No. 471 of 1981
The Judgment was delivered by: BHAGAVATHI, J.
1.  We are of the view that, having regard to the fact that the appellant did not intend to cause injury to the complainant in any vital part of the body and also having regard to the fact that his only son is in mental hospital, the sentence imposed on the appellant should be reduced.
2.  Hence we allow the appeal on the question of sentence and reduce the sentence from five years' rigorous imprisonment to three years' rigorous imprisonment.
Appeal allowed.
