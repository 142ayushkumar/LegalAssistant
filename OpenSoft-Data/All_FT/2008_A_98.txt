The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  This is an appeal against the judgment and final order dated 27th June, 2006 passed by Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 75/1994.
2.  On 4th May, 2007, this court while condoning the delay in filing the special leave petition had directed issuance of notice to the respondents limited to the question of payment of back wages. There is no dispute that the respondents have already been reinstated in service. After hearing learned counsel for the parties and perusing the materials on record, we are of the view that the respondents shall be entitled to back wages at a total sum of Rs. 5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs only) from the appellant, which shall be paid by the appellant to the respondents within three months from the date of supply of copy of this order.
3.  The impugned order of the High Court is modified to the extent mentioned above and the appeal is disposed of accordingly. Interim order, if any, shall stand vacated. There will be no order as to costs.
