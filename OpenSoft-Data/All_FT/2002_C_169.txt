1.  Heard Mr. Altaf Ahmad, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the appellants and Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the respondent.
Leave is granted.
2.  This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in IT Appln. No. 155 of 1997, dt. 15th October, 1999, taking the view that the following question is not a statable question of law. The question reads as follows:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was legally justified in holding that the incentive bonus paid by the assessee is allowable under s. 37 if it is not admissible under specific s. 36(1)(ii) of the IT Act, 1961 ?"
3.  We have perused the order of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 3507 of 1998, dt. 24th July, 1998, as also the order of this Court in Special Leave Petition (C) Nos. 15305 to 15307 of 1987, dt. 11th May, 1988.
4. We are of the view that the question for consideration by this Court in Special Leave Petition (C) Nos. 15305 to 15307 of 1987, dt. 11th May, 1988, was a different question. The aforementioned question is directly covered by the order of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 3507 of 1998, dt. 24th July, 1998.
5.  In our view the said question is a referable question of law and it arises from the order of the Tribunal so it needs to be referred to the High Court.
We, therefore, direct the Tribunal to state the case and refer the above-mentioned question of law to the High Court. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
