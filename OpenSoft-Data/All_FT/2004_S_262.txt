State Bank of Indi v M. S. Basi and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 July 2004
C.A. No. 4099 of 2004 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (C) No. 10886 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The only person interested in contesting this special leave petition insofar as the impugned order dated 30-1-2004 passed by the High Court is concerned, is Respondent 1, who is present on caveat.
Leave granted.
2.  With the consent of the parties, the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant and Respondent 1 are heard finally.
3.  It is not disputed and as is clear from the subsequent order dated 3-2-2004 passed by the High Court that the impugned order dated 30-1-2004 was passed without affording the party adversely affected i.e. the appellant before us, an opportunity of hearing. For this short reason, the impugned order deserves to be set aside.
4.  The appeal is allowed. The impugned order dated 30-1-2004 is set aside.
5. Liberty is allowed to Respondent 1 to move a fresh application seeking such relief as may be advised which shall be heard and decided by the High Court only after giving the opposite parties an opportunity of hearing.
Appeal allowed.
