Maqsoodan v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3265-3266/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr. JP Dhanda, Adv. enters appearance for respondent State.
Leave granted.
2.  On the fact situation, particularly since appellant is a lady, and in view of the relatively less serious offence involved, we are inclined to benefit the appellant with an order under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
3. We, therefore, direct that appellant, if arrested, shall be released on bail on her executing a bond in a sum of Rs.10,000/- to the satisfaction of the arresting officer. It is open to the investigating officer to question her under Section 161 of the Code. With these observations the appeals are disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
