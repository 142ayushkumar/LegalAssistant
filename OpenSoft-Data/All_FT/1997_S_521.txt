K. R. Raveendranathan v State of Kerala
Supreme Court of India

19 March 1997
Civil Appeal Nos. 2206-2211 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Special leave granted.
2. The learned counsel for the appellant points out that the question in issue in the present appeals is squarely covered by the decision of this Court in Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. v. State of J. and K., JT 1992 (4) SC 459 1992 Indlaw SC 585. In particular, it drew our attention of the judgment and the portion extracted from the decision in Sudarsan Trading Co. v. Government of Kerala, JT 1989 (1) SC 339 1989 Indlaw SC 463, case wherein it was said that by purporting to construe the contract, the Court could not take upon itself the burden of saying that this was contrary to the contract and, as such, beyond jurisdiction. That is exactly what the Court has done in the instant case.
Therefore, the issue stands covered by this decision and the learned counsel for the respondents could not in the face of this decision argue otherwise.
3. In the result, we allow these appeals and set aside the impugned order of the Division Bench of the High Court with no order as to costs.
Appeals allowed
