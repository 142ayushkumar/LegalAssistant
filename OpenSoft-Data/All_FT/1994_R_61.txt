Ram Beti Smt. and Others v Mohd. Yusuf Khan
Supreme Court of India

19 July 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The respondent is a retired government servant within the meaning of Section 23(J) (i) of Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act (for short 'the Act'). He filed an eviction application against the appellant on the ground of bona fide need as provided under Section 23-A of the Act, in relation to the non-residential premises in question.
The trial court ordered eviction. That order was affirmed by the High Court under revision.
2.  The only point that is raised before us if that for seeking eviction under Section 23-A of the Act, the retired government servant must move the court immediately after his retirement. We find no such limitation under the section, particularly in this case, on the facts we see no warrant for that submission. Though we were sought to be taken through the evidence, we decline to do so.
The civil appeal stands dismissed accordingly. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
