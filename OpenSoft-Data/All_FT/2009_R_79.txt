Rajasthan State Electricity Board and others v Nawal Kishore
Supreme Court of India

10 November 2009
C.A. No. 5193 of 2003 with C.A. No. 5194/2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. These appeals have been filed against the judgment and order dated 29th May, 2002 of the High Court of Judicature at Rajasthan. By the aforesaid judgment the High Court has directed that the respondent be given pay scale of Carpenter.
2.  It is well settled in a series of judgments of this Court that the Court should not fix pay scale as fixation of pay scales is a complicated exercise which has financial implications and cascading effect. It is for the concerned authorities to fix the pay scales and not for Judges. The Judiciary must exercise judicial restraint in such matters.
3. For the above reason, we set aside the judgment of the High court and permit the respondent to raise an industrial dispute. If he does so, we hope and trust that the matters will be decided by the Industrial Tribunal expeditiously after reference by the State Government. Appeals are allowed. No costs.
Appeals allowed.
