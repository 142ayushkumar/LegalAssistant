State of Madhya Pradesh v Rajaram
Supreme Court of India

1  May  2009
Criminal Appeal No. 900 of 2009 [Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No. 3250/2008]
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the sole respondent submits that he has no instructions as such in the matter. Be that as it may, on 18.2.2008, notice was issued indicating therein as to why the special leave petition should not be disposed of at the notice stage itself by remitting the matter back to the High Court for a fresh decision in accordance with law.
2.  The impugned order dated 14.5.2007 passed by the High Court in M.Crl.C. No. 8787/2006, disposing of the State's appeal, not only does not give any cogent reasons but is entirely cryptic in nature. In that view of the matter, we set aside the impugned order and remit the matter to the High Court for a fresh consideration in accordance with law.
The appeal is disposed of with the above direction.
Appeal disposed of
