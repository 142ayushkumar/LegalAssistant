Messrs J. C. Roadways v Messrs Pandiyan Roadways Corporation Limited and Another
Supreme Court of India

2 February 1977
C.A. No. 1680 of 1968.
The Order of the Court was as follows:.
1.  This appeal raises a short point as to whether executive instructions can be issued under Section 43-A of the Motor Vehicles (Madras Amendment) Act, 1948 in determining who should be awarded a permit for running a stage carriage.
2. This Court has held that executive instructions cannot be issued to control the discretionary jurisdiction of the tribunals and the view taken by the High Court is therefore correct.
We dismiss the appeal, but, in the circumstances, without costs.
Appeal dismissed.
