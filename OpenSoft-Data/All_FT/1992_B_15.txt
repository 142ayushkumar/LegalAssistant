State of Maharashtra v Baburao Kindu Patil and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 January 1992
Cr.A. Nos. 574-575 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have carefully gone through the records as well as the impugned judgment and also heard learned counsel for the respective parties. We are not inclined to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. Moreover, it may be pointed out that the offence is said to have taken place in the year 1976 i.e. nearly about 25 years before and the High Court has disposed of this appeal in the year 1978.
2.   Before parting with this order, we would like to add that the quantum of sentence imposed on the second accused (Sopan Trimbak Wani) is very meager and it does not commensurate with the gravity of the offence.
However, at this length of time, we do not like to interfere with the sentence. Both the appeals are dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
