State Of Haryana & Ors v Satyender Kumar
Supreme Court of India

30 April 2009
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1317 OF 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This appeal is directed against the order of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana dated 7/12/1999 in which a direction had been issued that the services of the petitioner/respondent before us be continued till regular appointees are appointed. The respondent had been appointed on contract basis and his service was terminable at any time without notice.
2.  Notice was issued in this case on 13/8/2001. The respondent was served but has not put in appearance. It appears that in some connected cases, this Court had stayed the order of the High Court in similar matters. It is possible, therefore, that the respondent, who was on contract basis, would have been relieved by now and it is this reason that he has not put in appearance despite notice. We are also disinclined to adjourn the appeal, as it pertains to the year 2002.
3.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the order of the High Court and dismiss the writ petition. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed
