Lok Prahari through its general secretary S. N. Shukla v State of Uttar Pradesh and others
Supreme Court of India

1 September 2005
Review Petition (C) No. 1328 of 2005 in S.L.P. (C) No. 11270 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  SLP (C) No.11270 of 2005 was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated 13-5-2005. This review petition seeks review of the said order so as to restore the SLP for hearing on merits.
2.  A writ petition filed by the petitioner herein is pending for hearing before the High Court. Prayer for interim relief was refused. Feeling aggrieved thereby, the SLP was filed. Now the grievance of the petitioner is that though interim relief has been denied yet the main petition is not being taken up for early hearing. It appears that the writ petition filed by the petitioner is of the year 2005.
The High Court has to plan its own calendar and arrange priority in the matter of hearing of cases. A special leave petition cannot be entertained merely because there is some delay in hearing of a matter in the High Court. The petitioner is still at liberty to move the High Court seeking an early hearing.
3.  No case is made out for entertaining the review petition which is dismissed in limine.
Review dismissed.
