Amritsar Club Rambagh Gardens v Punjab State Electricity Board and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14958/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  A Writ petition came to be filed in the High Court which was disposed of by stating that an alternative remedy is available before the Dispute Settlement Committee. The contention put forth on behalf of the appellant is that that remedy is not available to him because of the conditions contained in those provisions under which the said Committee has been constituted.
2. Whether it is so or not will have to be examined in detail or if the High Court so desires may go into the merits of the matter and decide the same.
3.  In the circumstances, we set aside the order passed by the High Court and remit the matter for fresh consideration in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made by us.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
