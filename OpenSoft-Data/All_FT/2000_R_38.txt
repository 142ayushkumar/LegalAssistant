Subir Bakshi and Another v R. T. A. Nadia and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 April 2000
C.As. Nos. 2774-75 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The short question in these appeals is whether the learned Single Judge could modify the order passed by the Division Bench by inserting the words "stopgap measure" after the words "stage carriage permit", as on that date the Division Bench was not sitting. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we conclude that learned Single Judge should not have modified the order passed by the Division Bench. The order itself refers that the Division Bench was not sitting on that day. For that reason, the learned Single Judge should not have modified the order.
2. Hence we set aside the impugned order and allow the appeals. Costs on the parties. Parties are at liberty to move the High Court as advised.
Appeals allowed.
