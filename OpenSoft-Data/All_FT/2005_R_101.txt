Ram Chandra v Chandra Mala
Supreme Court of India

23 September 2005
C.A. No. ... of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 19107 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
None appears on behalf of the respondent despite service.
Leave granted.
1.  The only issue in this appeal is whether the High Court ought to have condoned the delay of 77 days. As the respondent has not controverted any allegation before us we condone the delay subject to the appellant paying costs assessed at 
Rs.2000 to the respondent within two weeks.
2. In default of making such payment within the specified time, this appeal will stand dismissed.
Order accordingly.
