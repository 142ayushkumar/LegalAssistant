Chaman Lal v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

12 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20089/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petition stated that the matter might be disposed of at this stage by setting aside the order under challenge and restoring the writ petition to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits.
2.  The High Court has disposed of the writ petition filed by the appellant on the basis that there was no ground to interfere with the orders impugned thereby. It also said that the order would not be viewed as a comment on the election petition in which the appellant was the respondent. In the election petition the point at issue is the point that is at issue in the writ petition.
3.  We have heard learned counsel and we are of the view that the writ petition needs to be heard and disposed of on merits by a more detailed order than that which is under challenge.
4.  Nothing that we say shall be construed to be a comment on the case on either side.
5.  Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed. The order under challenge is set aside and the writ petition (C.W.P.No.11035 of 2000 (O&M)) is restored to the file of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana to be heard and disposed of on merits.
6.  The order of status quo that was passed by this Court on 15th December, 2000 shall operate for a period of six weeks and it shall be open to the appellant to move the High Court for further interim relief. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
