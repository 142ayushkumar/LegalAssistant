National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Limited v V.P. Gupta & Anr.
Supreme Court of India

4  May  2009
CIVIL APPEAL NO.3469 OF 2009(arising out of SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (C) NO.10645/2008)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated 22nd January, 2008 passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ Petition No.10758 of 2006 filed by the respondent herein. The High Court allowing the writ petition and setting aside the orders passed by the authorities, directed that the writ petitioner would be entitled to all the consequential benefits as a result of setting aside of the order of removal passed against him. High Court had granted full backwages to him. It has been submitted before us that other service benefits, which he is entitled for after retirement, have already been given.
2.  In that view of the matter, we are of the opinion that only order that can be passed in this appeal is to modify the backwages granted to the respondent.
3. Accordingly, we modify the impugned order and direct to pay 30 per cent of the backwages to the respondent.
4.  The appeal is accordingly disposed of with no order as to costs. Interim order granted by this Court stands vacated.
