G. Thankamma Amma and Another v N. Raghava Kurup and Others
Supreme Court of India

16 March 2000
C.A. No. 2266 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal is directed against the order made by the High Court, in a second appeal. Perusal of the judgment made by the High Court does not disclose that there is any formulation of question of law as contemplated under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
 before deciding the matter. The scope of Section 100 CPC has been explained by this Court time and again and it is wholly unnecessary to refer to those decisions.
2.  In the circumstances of the case, we set aside the order made by the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration after framing an appropriate question of law. The appeal is allowed accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
