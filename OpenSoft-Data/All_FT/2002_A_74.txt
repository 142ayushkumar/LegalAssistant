The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioners undertake to take steps to serve the unserved respondents within three weeks in SLPs (C) Nos. 20498 and 17381 of 2002.
SLPs (C) Nos. 18172, 18183 and 17381 of2002
2.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties we are of the view that matters require consideration. Accordingly we grant leave in all the SLPs. However, having regard to the questions involved regarding the supply of power, rate thereof and the allied matters, the appeals deserve to be heard early. We expedite the hearing and give parties liberty to mention the matters before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India.
3.  As an adhoc arrangement in terms of the order dated 11-10-2002, we directed that till further orders the power taken by Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh shall be paid for @ Rs 2.72 per unit and the difference between this rate and the rate to be calculated in terms of the order dated 8-10-2002 passed by the A.P. Electricity Regulatory Commission, Hyderabad shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account so that when the matters are heard appropriate directions can be passed. That order has been passed without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties.
4. The said order would continue till the decision of these matters. From the submissions made on behalf of M/s LYS Power Ltd., it appears that some adhoc agreement, without prejudice to the rights and contentions, will have to be entered into to facilitate the purchase and sale of electricity in terms of the order dated 11-10-2002.
5.  We direct the A.P. Electricity Regulatory Commission to hear the representatives of both the parties so as to explore the possibility of an agreed adhoc agreement for the working out of the sale of electricity in terms of order dated 11-10-2002. In case the Commission is unable to make parties agree, it shall pass an order requiring the parties to enter into such adhoc agreement.
6. In case of any difficulty the Commission is granted leave to seek directions from this Court. The adhoc arrangement would be without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in the same manner as is the order dated 11-10-2002. Subject to these directions, the impugned orders of the High Court are stayed. Let the directions be complied with within a period of three weeks.
