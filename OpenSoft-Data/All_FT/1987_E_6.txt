State of Uttar Pradesh v Ekhlaq Ahmad
Supreme Court of India

4 February 1987
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 3478-A of 1985 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 20 August 1985 of the High Court of Allahabad in Habeas Corpus Petition No. 5525 of 1985)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is great force in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that since the allegation was that a bomb was thrown at the meeting at the time of the election the question was one relating to public order and not law and order and detention of the respondent for a period beyond the date of election would not render the detention bad.
2.  Even so as 16 months have passed since the quashing of the detention order we do not consider it appropriate to issue a notice to the respondent in order to examine the validity of the judgment of the High Court. On this short ground alone we are dismissing the special leave petition. We should not be understood as having approved the view taken by the High Court.
Petition Dismissed.
