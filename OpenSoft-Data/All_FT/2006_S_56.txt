Jagdish Prasad v Sampatraj
Supreme Court of India

25 August 2006
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 13548 of 2006
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
1.  We do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned order. The special leave petition is dismissed.
2.  As the suit was filed in the year 1991, we are of the view that it is high time that delivery of possession should be effected with utmost expedition. If execution case is pending or if the same is filed henceforth, delivery of possession of the premises in question shall be effected in favour of the landlord after evicting the tenant therefrom any time after 31.12.2006, in view of the fact that the High Court has granted time to the tenant to vacate the premises by 31.12.2006, but not later than 31.1.2007. If for effecting delivery of possession, the executing court requires any armed force to be deputed, the same shall be requisitioned from the Superintendent of Police concerned who shall depute the same within 48 hours from the date the requisition is received.
3. It is made clear that in case any person other than the judgment-debtor is found in possession of the subject in dispute, he shall also be evicted by the armed force.
Petition dismissed.
