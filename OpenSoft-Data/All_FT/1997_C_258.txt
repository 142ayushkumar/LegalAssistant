Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and Another v Subramanyam and Company
Supreme Court of India

23 July 1997
C.As. Nos. 2569-72 of 1989 with Nos. 190-200 of 1990, 44 of 1992, 9168 of 1994 and 8078 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question for decision in these appeals is whether PVC leather cloth falls within the definition of "textile" used in Entry I Schedule I of the Karnataka Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas for Consumption, Use or Sale therein Act, 1979. The High Court has taken the view that PVC leather cloth is not textile so as to fall within the above entry.
2. It is admitted that there is no process of weaving involved in making PVC leather cloth and also that it is not manufactured in mills, powerlooms or handlooms as required by the entry. We do not find any infirmity in the view taken by the High Court.
The appeals are, therefore, dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
