Sube Singh Bahmani v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

8 April 1997
S.L.P. (C) No. 16648 of 1996 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 10-7 1996 in CW.P. No. 5533 of 1996 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh) with Contempt Petition (C) No. 133 of 1997 and S.L.P. (C) No. 23107 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It appears to us that a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Ajit Singh Januja v. State of Punjab  1996 Indlaw SC 3762  after extensively referring to the decision of this Court in R. K. Sabharwal case R. K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab, 1995 Indlaw SC 17561995 Indlaw SC 17561995 Indlaw SC 1756 and also in Virpal Singh case Union of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan, 1995 Indlaw SC 18031995 Indlaw SC 18031995 Indlaw SC 1803 in the decision, has held to the following effect:
" We respectfully concur with the view in Union of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan Union of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan, 1995 Indlaw SC 18031995 Indlaw SC 18031995 Indlaw SC 1803, that seniority between the reserved category candidates and general candidates in the promoted category shall continue to be governed by their panel position i.e. with reference to their inter se seniority in the lower grade."
2.  It however appears that in the ultimate order passed in the said case, this Court allowed retrospective operation of the above principle of seniority in the matter of promotion although in Virpal case Union of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan, 1995 Indlaw SC 18031995 Indlaw SC 18031995 Indlaw SC 1803 only prospective operation was indicated. It also appears that later on, persons who were affected on account of giving such retrospective operation to the principle of seniority, made an application for clarification of the said order in Januja case  1996 Indlaw SC 3762  but such application was dismissed without making any observation on the question of prospectivity or retrospectivity. Since the correctness of the ultimate decision in Januja case  1996 Indlaw SC 3762  has been raised and a large number of persons are likely to be affected if retrospective operation is given on the basis of the ultimate order made in Januja case  1996 Indlaw SC 3762
we feel that it would be only proper if these matters are considered by a three-Judge Bench. The contempt petition may also be placed with these matters.
List all the matters before a three-Judge Bench.
Oder accordingly.
