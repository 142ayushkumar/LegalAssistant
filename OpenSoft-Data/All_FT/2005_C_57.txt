1.  One of the questions which arises for consideration in this appeal is the interpretation of Sections 19 and 20 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, as regards the jurisdiction of the Lok Adalat, to pass a decree of divorce.
2.  Mr Pramod Swarup, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, relying on the decision of this Court in Asha Devi v. Chaturdas 2001 Indlaw SC 21402 contends that as a decree for divorce cannot be passed on consent, such a decree could not have been passed in a proceeding held under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. Mr S.K. Dhingra, learned counsel for the respondent, however, says that if the consent decree passed is not collusive, the same is not invalid in law.
3. In view of the importance of the question involved, we are of the opinion that the matter requires consideration by a larger Bench. Let the matter be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for appropriate orders.
Liberty to mention.
Order accordingly.
