Renu v Anil Arora
Supreme Court of India

30 August 1999
Transfer Petitions (C) Nos. 34-35 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The transfer petitions are filed by the wife in respect of matrimonial proceedings and guardianship proceedings from the Tis Hazari Court in Delhi to the Court of the District Judge in Jullundhur. The transfer petition quotes the husband's divorce petition, and it is not disputed, that the wife is unable to move from her bed.
2. It is pointed out on behalf of the husband that since she is unable to move from her bed, it is of no consequence whether these proceedings are heard in Delhi or in Jullundhur. We cannot agree. Even though she may not be able to move from her bed in Jullundhur, her presence in that city would be advantageous to those who conduct the proceedings on her behalf.
3.  The transfer petitions are accordingly allowed and HMA Proceedings No.884 of 1996, and Guardianship Civil Suit No.200 of 1997, pending before the Tis Hazari Court in Delhi are transferred to the Court of the District Judge, Jullundhur to be heard by him or by a court to which they are assigned by him.
No order as to costs.
Petitions allowed.
