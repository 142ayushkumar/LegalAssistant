University Grant Commission v Bijoy Oommen and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13633/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The main ground submitted by the appellant is that the advertisement is very clear which gives the minimum eligibility marks to be 55% excluding the grace marks.
It is not in dispute in the present case that the respondent in whose favour the writ petition was allowed by the High Court has secured 55% marks with 4 grace marks. In view of that the minimum eligibility is not there so far as the contesting respondent is concerned.
2. The High Court fell into error in allowing the writ petition without properly adverting to the advertisement which specified the minimum eligibility condition.
3.  Accordingly, we set aside the order of the High Court. The writ petition of the contesting respondent is dismissed. The appeal is allowed. Costs on the parties.
Appeal allowed.
