Kanwaljit Singh and Others v Ranjit Singh
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7001/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. This special leave petition is directed against the order passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on 13th September, 1999 in Civil Revision Petition No.2927/98 in which the Court allowed the revision petition filed by the respondent herein and set aside the order of the trial court permitting the present appellant to place on record secondary evidence relating to the arbitration agreement.
2.  It is stated at the Bar, that, in the meantime, the case in which the aforementioned order was passed, i.e. case No.130/2/94 has been decided by the trial court and the judgment/order is under challenge in a revision petition filed by the appellant herein before the High Court.
3.  Therefore, the order under challenge in this special leave petition, which is in the nature of an interim order, has lost its relevance. In the circumstances, we do not feel it necessary to consider the case on merits.
4. However, we make it is clear that the High Court will dispose of the civil revision, which is stated to be pending before it, in accordance with law after giving opportunity of hearing to the parties, without being influenced by the observations made in the order under challenge. The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
