The following two questions were referred to the High Court for its decision.
"(1) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the sum of pound 2, 486, 180 which had been set apart by the assessee-company as an estimated provision for meeting its tax liability in future less the last instalment of demand under section 18A(1) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 was a debt owed by the assessee on the relevant valuation date within the meaning of cl.
