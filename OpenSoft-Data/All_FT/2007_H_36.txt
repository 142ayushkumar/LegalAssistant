Haryana Urban Development Authority v Omwati Sharma (dead) by Lrs.
Supreme Court of India

6 August 2007
IAs Nos. 3-4 in and C.A. No. 3948 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Delay in filing application for substitution is condoned.
Application for substitution is allowed.
1.  It appears that the District Consumer Redressal Forum (hereinafter referred to as "the District Forum"), while allowing the complaint granted interest at the rate of 10% per annum, which has been confirmed in appeal. When the matter was taken by the appellant in revision before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as "the National Commission"), it enhanced the rate of interest from 10% to 18% per annum although there was no revision application filed on behalf of the respondents before the National Commission. It has been also stated that the respondents did not challenge the order passed by the District Forum awarding interest at the rate of 10%.
2. In view of these facts, we are of the view that the National Commission was not justified in enhancing the interest from 10% to 18% per annum.
3.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the impugned order enhancing the rate of interest from 10% to 18% per annum is set aside and the order passed by the District Forum awarding interest at the rate of 10% per annum is restored. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
