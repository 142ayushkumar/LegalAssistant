S. M. Kunjumoideen v Kadormoora Hassan Beevi (Dead) and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 February 1994
C.A. No. 428 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The only point that is urged in this civil appeal is after Kerala Act 2 of 1965 came into force, the earlier sub-letting cannot be a ground for eviction. We are unable to agree. As rightly held by the High Court the corresponding provision of 1959 Act would take care of the sub-letting even prior to 1965.
2.  There are no merits in this civil appeal. The appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
