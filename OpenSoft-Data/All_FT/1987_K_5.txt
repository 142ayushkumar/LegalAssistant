K. Sadananda Rao v K. Murari Rao and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 February 1987
Civil Miscellaneous Petitions Nos. 4230 of 1987, with 23711 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we feel that the offer made by Shri C. S. Vaidyanathan, learned counsel appearing for defendants 1, 11 and 23 and group of partners supporting them stepping up their bid to Rs. 90 lakhs should, in the circumstances be accepted. Shri C. Viswanatha Iyer, learned counsel appearing for the plaintiff however contends that instead of accepting the bid so offered, a re-auction should be held as directed by the High Court on March 9, 1987 with a view to get a higher price. We do not think that that would be a proper course to adopt. There must be some finality to these proceedings. Admittedly, the plaintiffs did not participate in the auction held on June 23, 1986 pursuant to this Court's direction and now it is too late to ask for a re-auction.
2. The order of the High Court directing a re-auction is accordingly set aside. The High Court shall proceed to accept the bid of the aforementioned defendants subject to the condition that they shall deposit 25 per cent of the amount of Rs. 90 lakhs offered by them within ten days from today before the High Court after adjustment of the amount already deposited. The balance amount after effecting a set-off as per orders of this Court dated February 18, 1986, shall be deposited within one month from today. In the event the defendants aforementioned fail to comply with these terms, the property shall be put to re-auction with an upset price of Rs. 90 lakhs.
3. The plaintiffs would be entitled to withdraw the amount of Rs. 12 lakhs deposited by them in the bank.
4. Civil Miscellaneous Petition Nos. 4230 and 23711 of 1986 are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
