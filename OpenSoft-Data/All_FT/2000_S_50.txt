Sadhu Singh and Another v R. S. Verma and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2000
Contempt Petition (C) No. 170 of 2000 In Ca No. 5325 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties and examined the responses filed by the respondents as also additional affidavits. Even if it be assumed that there is a genuine controversy with regard to the interpretation of judgments of this Court in Ajit Singh (II) v. State of Punjab 1999 Indlaw SC 725 and Sube Singh Bahmani v. State of Haryana 1999 Indlaw SC 718 recourse to contempt proceedings is not a proper course to resolve such a controversy. We are not satisfied that there has been any wilful disobedience of the orders of this Court.
2. We, therefore, do not entertain the contempt petition. The contempt petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
3.  We, however, clarify that the dismissal of this contempt petition shall not be construed as any expression of opinion on the issues raised in the petition and that it shall be open to the petitioners to take recourse to such other remedy in such forum as may be available to them in law.
Petition dismissed.
