Aditya Minerals Private Limited v Commr. of Income Tax, A.P.
Supreme Court of India

18 February 1998
C.As. Nos. 4858-59 of 1989
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  From a perusal of the judgment in Pingle Industries Ltd. v. CIT and in Gotan Lime Syndicate v. CIT.
2. It appears to us that the nature of the payments made in the two cases were essentially identical. The two judgments, however, take different views with regard to the nature of the expenditure. Both the judgments were rendered by three learned Judges of this Court.
3.  It is, therefore, appropriate that to resolve the conflict in these two judgments, this case be placed before a Bench larger than three Judges. Let the papers be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for constitution of a larger Bench to resolve the conflict.
Order accordingly.
