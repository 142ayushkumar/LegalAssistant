Saraswathi Oil Traders v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

29 January 2002
C.As. Nos. 823 and 824 of 2002 (Appeals by special leave from the order Dt. 28 February 2001, of the Karnataka High Court in Civil Petitions Nos. 132 and 132-A of 1999).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The order under challenge was passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka on an application by the Revenue under section 256(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
2.  The Revenue sought to refer to the High Court the following question:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal is right in law in deleting the additions made on account of bogus purchases of ground nut cakes as well as additions made on account of unaccounted income of sale of groundnut oil for the assessment years 1990-91 and 1991-92 ?"
3.  The Tribunal declined to make the reference because, in its view, the question was not a question of law. The High Court found it necessary to record that a careful assessment of the record would indicate that there was a definite point of law involved and that the Tribunal's conclusion was incorrect.
4.  As we read the question, it does not involve any question of law and the High Court has not recorded what definite point of law it found was involved. We must record that, with fairness, the learned Attorney-General has not supported the order of the High Court.
5.  The civil appeals are allowed. The order under challenge is set aside. No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
