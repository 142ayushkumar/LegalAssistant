A.L. Vadivelu and Anr v U.M.S. Radio Factory Limited and Anr
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 474-475/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is open to the petitioner to raise all the contentions in the trial court and substantiate, if it is true, that the cause of action has arisen on a prior date when the drawer of the cheque received previous notice.
2.  Learned counsel submits that the observation made by the learned single judge of the High Court may prejudice the right of the petitioners in substantiating so. We make it clear that the right to establish the aforesaid would remain unhampered despite any observation made in the impugned order.
With these observations the SLPs are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
