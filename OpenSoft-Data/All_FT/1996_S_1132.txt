Collector of Customs, Bombay v Super Fasteners, Marwana (Haryana)
Supreme Court of India

10 October 1996
C.A. No. 108 of 1986, Appeal from (1985) 5 ETR 376 (Cegat)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Time of payment of Rs. 300 is extended up to the end of this month. The counsel assures us that the payment will be made. On that assurance, we proceed with the hearing of the appeal.
2.  The respondent imported a second-hand automatic multi-station nut-making machine under Invoice No. 1044 showing the price as 24, 500 pounds. Later on, it was found that while the nut-making machine qualifies for clearance under OGL, the tapping machine did not so qualify and hence the import of the tapping machine was illegal. The appellant-Department, therefore, confiscated the tapping machine under the Customs Act, 1962 read with the relevant provisions of the ITC policy. In addition thereto, a redemption fine of Rs.2 lakhs came to be imposed.
3.   The Tribunal, while conceding that the import of the tapping machine was unauthorised and the confiscation of the machine was valid, thought that the redemption fine was very much on the higher side and reduced it to Rs.25,000 only, having regard to the value of the tapping machine which was estimated to be 1200 pounds. It is on this limited question that this appeal has been filed and the Revenue desires that we interfere with the Tribunal's order reducing the redemption a fine. We are not inclined to do so. We think that the redemption fine of Rs.2 lakhs was on the higher side having regard to the total value of the tapping machine at the relevant date. If the Tribunal in its discretion thought that the fine was exorbitant and disproportionate and decided to reduce it, we do not think that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, any exception can be taken to that course of action.
We, therefore, dismiss this appeal with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
