Nasir Ahmad Bhatti v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1843/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1. Admittedly, for want of proper reasons the impugned orders cannot be sustained and accordingly the orders under challenge are set aside. We allow a period of two weeks to the accused to surrender. The petitioners however would be at liberty to file an application for bail and such application shall be disposed of in accordance with law.
The appeals are, accordingly, disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
