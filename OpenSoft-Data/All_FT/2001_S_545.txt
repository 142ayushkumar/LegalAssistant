State of Bihar and Others v Uma Talkies and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...CC 7230-7239/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
Delay in filing as well as in refiling is condoned.
1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at length we are not inclined to interfere with the order impugned in these special leave petitions, except to clarify that in the impugned order the sentence, namely,
"all pending proceedings and demands are quashed and the respondents are directed to act in future in accordance with this judgment"
obviously refers to only those proceedings out of which the writ petitions had arisen. With the above clarification, the special leave petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
