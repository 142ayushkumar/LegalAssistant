Krishna Kumar Mittal v Parmeshwar Dayal Gupta
Supreme Court of India

17 February 2005
C.A. No. 7174 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel appearing for the parties.
1.  This appeal arises out of a complaint made by the appellant against the respondent to the Bar Council. The respondent was engaged as an advocate in his previous litigation. The allegation made is that the respondent, after a number of years in respect of the same litigation of the same property, appeared as an advocate for the opposite party.
2. According to the complainant, this was an act of professional misconduct by changing sides.
3.  The matter was taken up by the Bar Council which, after hearing the complainant and the advocate, did not consider it a fit case for taking any disciplinary action. The advocate initially tried to justify his act of representing the opposite party in the second case which arose after more than ten years, from the previous litigation.
4. It is pointed out on behalf of the advocate that after the complainant objected to the appearance of the advocate for the opposite party, the advocate withdrew himself from the case. The Bar Council, on the above facts had exonerated the advocate holding that there was no professional misconduct as to deserve any disciplinary action.
5.  After hearing learned counsel, we find no ground to take a view different from the one taken by the Bar Council. The appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
