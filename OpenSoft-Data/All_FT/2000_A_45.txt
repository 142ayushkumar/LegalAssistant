Aakancha Gupta v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4745/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have read the order under challenge and heard learned counsel. We are of the opinion that this was not the way to proceed to dispose of a writ petition relying, as was done, upon the production before the Court of a report of the scrutiny made of the answer books. The report should have been required to be placed on affidavit and the other side should have been permitted to file a counter thereto. We have no doubt, in the circumstances, that the order under challenge must be set aside challenge must be set aside and the writ petition should be remanded to the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits with a speaking order. We do not say any more because we do not wish to prejudice the case on either side.
2. The appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The writ petition [W.P. No.2477 (M/S) of 1999] is remanded to the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits, with a speaking order, expeditiously. The High Court shall proceed from such stage as it deems appropriate. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
