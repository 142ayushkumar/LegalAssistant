S. Krishna Murthy and Others v State of Andhra Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 December 1994
W.P. (C) No. 1246/1989,
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Issue rule nisi.
1.  Heard learned counsel for both parties. Admittedly no minimum wage has been fixed for the category of workmen like the petitioners working in the Irrigation Department of the State Government. We, therefore, direct that such minimum wage should be fixed by the State Government under the Minimum Wages Act within 4 months from today. It is understood that if there are any norms fixed for the work to be transacted during the course of the day, the workers will not be deprived of the minimum wage that may be so fixed if they fail to conform to the norms; disciplinary action may be taken against them for failing to conform to the norms.
2.  The petitioners allege that they have in fact worked for certain period in the past but they have not been paid the minimum wage. They can agitate these grievances before the proper forum. The petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
