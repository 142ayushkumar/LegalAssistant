Manoj Kulshrestha v Indira Gandhi National Open Univ. and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7810/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties exhaustively.
1.  We have gone through the original file as well as the reasons recorded by the Division Bench and after considering the same, in our view, the impugned order passed by the High Court does not call for any interference. However, with regard to the last paragraph of the said judgment which reads as under stands deleted:
"It is clarified that the Respondent No.5 will not be entitled to experience as a Reader. He was wrongly appointed and has wrongly worked as a Reader pending the petition and this appeal. His work, during this period, will count as experience as a Lecturer only."
2. We also direct that the University should prescribe precise qualifications for appointment to the post of reader/lecturer and advertise the same properly so that eligible candidates can apply for the same. Appeals are disposed of accordingly. However, there will be no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
