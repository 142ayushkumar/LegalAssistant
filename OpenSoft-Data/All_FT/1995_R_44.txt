Rajpal v State Of Haryana And Ors.
Supreme Court of India

20 November 1995
Civil Appeal No. 11401 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  In view of the order passed by this Court in S.L.P.(C) Nos.3099-3100/85 & batch, the persons similarly situated were admittedly taken into service and their services have been regularised. Under these circumstances, since the appellant, who is the same position, we think, on this special circumstance, he is also entitled to the same relief.
2.  The appeal is accordingly allowed. But the appellant would not be entitled to the back-wages; he would, however, get all other consequential benefits. The respondents are directed to take the appellant into service within a period of four weeks from the date of the receipt of this order.
Appeals allowed
