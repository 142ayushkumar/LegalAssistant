"Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in having upheld in entirety the disallowance of the assessee's claim of a sum of Rs. 8, 00, 063 on account of demurrage and wharfage recovered from the assessee by the North Western Railways, merely because a claim against the contractor was pending for arbitration?"
2.  We, accordingly, allow the appeal and direct the Tribunal to refer the aforesaid question to the High Court.
Appeal allowed.
