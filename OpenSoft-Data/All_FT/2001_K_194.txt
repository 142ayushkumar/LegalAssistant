Rajinder Kitroo v Khusheed Naqeeb and Anr
Supreme Court of India

29 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12462/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court in the impugned order pointed out that the stand adopted by the respondent (if that considered the claim of the petitioner over and again but found not acceptable) may be an occasion to challange the proceedings adopted against the petitioner. But we do not find any scope for initiating contempt proceeding against the respondent.
2. We dismiss the SLP without prejudice to the right of the petitioner, if any, in filing a petition challenging the denial of promotion to the petitioner. Accordingly the SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
