The Order of the Court was as follows:
SLP (C) No. 11540 of 2004
Service is not complete.
The hearing in this matter is separated.
List after service is complete.
1. WPs (Crl.) Nos. 206-10 of 2003 and WP (C) No. 508 of 2003
2.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. Pandit M.S.M. Sharma v. Sri Krishna Sinha 1958 Indlaw SC 135 is a Constitution Bench decision (five Judges). Certain observations made in Special Reference No. 1 of 1964, Re1964 Indlaw SC 447 extensively read out by Mr Harish N. Salve, the learned Senior Counsel, run in conflict with the law laid down in Pandit M.S.M. Sharma case 1958 Indlaw SC 135 (supra); though in Special Reference No. 1 of 1964, Re 1964 Indlaw SC 447 a seven-Judge Bench expressed an opinion that they were in agreement with the majority decision in Pandit M.S.M. Sharma case 1958 Indlaw SC 135 (supra)
Shri Salve further submitted that the issue has very wide ramifications and is likely to arise in future and needs to be settled authoritatively.
Let the matter be placed for consideration by a seven-Judge Bench.
Order accordingly.
