In Re : Enforcement and Implementation of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2004
W.P. (C) No. 499 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In spite of order dated 16-1-2004 passed by this Court, the States of Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and the Union Territory of Pondicherry continue to be in default.
2.  Responses have been filed by the States of U.P. and Rajasthan. but full compliance with the Court's directions is yet to be made inasmuch as the amendment to the rules is still under consideration.
3.  We make it clear that the compliance is called for not only in the matter of finalisation of rules on the basis of model rules framed by the Central Government but the Dowry Prohibition Officers are also to be appointed and the Advisory Boards constituted.
4.  The learned amicus curiae has pointed out that in some of the States Dowry Prohibition Officers have been appointed simply by giving an additional charge to the previously appointed officers discharging other duties and such appointment may prove to be an eyewash only inasmuch as the already overburdened officers may not be able to discharge for want of time and energy, the provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act and Rules.
5.  We expect compliance with the order of the Court in letter and spirit. Eight weeks' time is allowed as a matter of last opportunity for compliance. Office shall appoint a date for hearing.
On the appointed date if any State or Union Territory continues to be in default, the Secretary of the department concerned of such defaulting States/Union Territory shall remain personally present in the Court.
Order accordingly.
