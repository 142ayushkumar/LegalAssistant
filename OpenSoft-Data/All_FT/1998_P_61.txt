Prime Channel and another v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

28 August 1998
IA No. ... in C.A. No. 16833 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this application by M/s Namah Shivay Enterprises, the prayer is that the slot allotted to them at present, i.e. 9.30 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. on every Monday must continue to be allotted for the extended episodes also, as Doordarshan agreed to have the extension of the serial for another 56 episodes more. This is seriously opposed by the original appellant Prime Channel, on the ground that they were asked to wait till the completion of the initially agreed 91 episodes.
2. As for the intervenor, the contention is that, Monday being an auspicious day for Shiva worshippers, it would be more appropriate that the extended episodes are screened on Monday and not on Tuesday. On the other hand, it is represented on behalf of the original appellant that there are many other considerations for their serial to be screened on Monday itself.
3.  We do not think that it is for the Court to decide as to which day should be allotted to one serial or the other. We leave it to Doordarshan to fix up the day or the slot regarding the extended episodes for M/s Namah Shivay Enterprises in consideration of a variety of factors which they are in a better position to take into account. They can also explore the possibility whether other times can be allotted, if not on all Mondays, at least on alternate Mondays. This is only a suggestion and it is for Doordarshan to take a final decision. With these observations we dispose of this application.
Application disposed of.
