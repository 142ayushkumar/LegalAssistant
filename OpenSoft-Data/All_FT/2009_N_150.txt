Nidhi Jachin v Jachin Krishna and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 March 2009
Transfer Petition (Crl.) Nos. 151 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the respective parties in respect of the two transfer petitions.
2.  There is no dispute that the petitioner is employed in a transferable job, which may entail her to be transferred to any part of the country. All the four cases in respect of which two transfer petitions have been filed, have been instituted in Noida (U.P.). In the event, the petitioner is transferred anywhere else from Dehradun, it may lead to fresh applications for transfer.
3.  We, therefore, see no reason to entertain the transfer petitions, which are dismissed.
Petition dismissed
