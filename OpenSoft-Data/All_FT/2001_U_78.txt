C. Radha v Union Bank of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

29 October 2001
C.A. No.7118/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we see no reason to interfere with the order of the High Court, especially in view of the fact that the appellant is a partner of the firm against whom a decree has been passed and the property in question in any case can be attached and sold for the satisfaction of the decree.
2. We need not go into the question whether there was a charge or not. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
