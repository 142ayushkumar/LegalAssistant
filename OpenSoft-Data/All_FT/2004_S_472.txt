Sathuluri Veeraiah and Others v State of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

22 September 2004
Cr.A. No. 1378 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the parties.
1.  The appellants along with other seventeen accused persons were charged and tried for the offence punishable under Sections 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 [for short "the IPC"] and by judgment rendered by trial Court, all of them were acquitted of the charge. On appeal being preferred by the State of Andhra Pradesh before the High Court, the order of acquittal was confirmed in relation to other fourteen accused persons. Accused No.4 (Sathuluri China Mastan) died during the pendency of the appeal, as such appeal against him abated. The High Court reversed the order of acquittal in relation to three appellants, namely, Sathuluri Veeraiah, Sathuluri Rayappa and Sathuluri Sanjeeva Rao (appellant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 herein) and convicted them under Section 302 and sentenced to undergo imprisonment of life.
2. They were further convicted under Sections 148 and 448 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years and one year respectively. The sentences, however, have been ordered to run concurrently. Hence this appeal.
3.  Having heard the parties and perused the records, we are of the view that High Court has reversed the order of acquittal after threadbare discussion of evidence and was quite justified in coming to the conclusion that order of acquittal suffered from the vice of perversity. We do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned judgment.
Accordingly, appeal fails and the same is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
