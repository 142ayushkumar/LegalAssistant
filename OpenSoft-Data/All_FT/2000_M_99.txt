S. K. Verma v Madhya Pradesh High Court and another
Supreme Court of India

9  May  2000
W.P. (C) No. 292 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The grievance made in this writ petition under Article 32, of the Constitution of India is a very peculiar one. The first appeal was heard by learned Single Judge of the High Court on 17-9-1998, and judgment was reserved. Till date, according to learned counsel for the petitioner, judgment is not pronounced. Though he mentioned the matter to the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the High Court by filing an application but uptil now nothing has been done.
2. We appreciate the anxiety and the grievance of the petitioner but even though this direct writ petition is not maintainable, we request the learned Single Judge of the High Court who heard the first appeal on 17-9- 1998, to make it convenient to pronounce the judgment within two weeks of the re-opening of the High Court after summer vacation.
3. A copy of this order containing the aforesaid request will be sent by the Registry of this Court to the Registrar of the High Court for placing the same before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of that High Court for information of the learned Judge who heard the first appeal. We hope and trust the petitioner will have no further grievance in this connection. The writ petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
