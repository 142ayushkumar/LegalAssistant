And
Special Leave Petition (Crl) Nos. 1949-50 of 1984
(From the Judgment and Order dated 13.3.84 and 16.3.84
The Judgment was delivered by : Amarendra Nath Sen, J.
1. There is no merit in this Writ Petition. The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
2. In my view, the writ petition challenging the validity of the order and judgment passed by this Court as nullity or otherwise incorrect cannot be entertained. I wish to make it clear that the dismissal of this writ petition will not prejudice the right of the petitioner, to approach the Court with an appropriate review petition or to file any other application which he may be entitled in law to file.
3. DESAI, J. I broadly agree with the conclusion recorded by my brother.
4. The learned Judge in deciding the S.L.P. (Crl) Nos. 1149-50/1984 has followed the decision of this Court. The learned Judge was perfectly justified and indeed it was the duty of the learned Judge to follow the decision of this Court which is binding on him.
Special leave petitions are dismissed.
