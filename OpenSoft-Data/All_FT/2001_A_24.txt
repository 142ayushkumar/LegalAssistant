A.C. Poonacha and Anr v Parameshwar Pratap
Supreme Court of India

29 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 928/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners. In our view, the impugned order passed by the High Court does not call for any interference at this stage.
2. However, it would be open to the petitioner No.2, to file appropriate application for granting exemption from appearing in the Court at the time of the trial.
3.  The trial court to grant the same on proper conditions. It is also made clear that it would be open to the petitioner to raise all the contentions at the time of framing of charge and if court finds no ground to proceed further with the complaint, it may drop the proceedings at an appropriate stage. With these observations this petition stands disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
