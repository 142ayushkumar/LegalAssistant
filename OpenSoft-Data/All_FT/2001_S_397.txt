Mallikarjuna v Spl. Land Acquisition Officer, Gulbarga
Supreme Court of India

10 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)......./2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the High Court has made some arithmetical mistake in calculating the total amount of the produce for the purpose of multiplying and counsel also submitted that multiplier should have been 16 as per the decision of this Court in Executive Director vs. Sarat Chandra Bisoi and Another  2000 Indlaw SC 522. If the petitioner has argued before the High Court that the multiplier should have been 16 on the strength of this decision and if the calculation is vitiated by that multiplier then it calls for a review of the impugned judgment.
2. We permit the petitioner to move the review petition in the High Court. If any such application for review is filed within 30 days from today in that case the same shall be entertained notwithstanding the delay involved. With these observations this Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition diposed of.
