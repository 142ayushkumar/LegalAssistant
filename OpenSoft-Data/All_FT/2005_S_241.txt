Smita Sinha v Sujit Kumar
Supreme Court of India

17 January 2005
Transfer Petition (C) No. 599 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard parties.
1.  This is the wife's petition for transfer of Case No. 67 of 2003, titled Sujit Kumar v. Smita Sinha from the IVth Additional District Judge, Gaya, Bihar to the Court of District Judge, New Delhi.
2.  The petitioner wife claims that she has a 1 year old daughter whom she cannot leave alone or take to Gaya. She also claims that she has no independent source of income to meet the travelling, lodging and boarding expenses. In reply it is submitted that the petitioner is living with her father in Patna and that proceedings had been adopted by her before the Bihar State Women Commission wherein her address was shown to be in Patna.
3.  We have heard the parties. In the petition it has been stated that the petitioner had to shift to Delhi. The reasons given for so shifting are disputed facts with which we are not concerned in this petition. However, the fact remains that she has shifted to Delhi and she has a small child who cannot be left alone.
4. We, therefore, allow the transfer petition. Case No. 67 of 2003, is transferred from the IVth Additional District Judge, Gaya, Bihar to the District Judge, Delhi who shall either hear it himself or assign it to some other court of competent jurisdiction for disposal.
Petition allowed.
