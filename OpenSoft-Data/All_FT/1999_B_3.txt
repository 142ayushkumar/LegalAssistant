9.  The High Court found that the claim in respect of items 1 and 5 are totally unsupportable in law. Considering the nature of the matter very widely, the appellant did not pursue with these two claims in this Court. If we exclude these two claim the balance of the claim will be much less than what was originally claimed by the appellant. In the ordinary course, we should have set aside the award and remanded the matter back to the Arbitrator to reassess the amount payable to the appellant except Claim Nos. 1 and 5 inasmuch as, we are not in a position to ascertain the mind of the Arbitrator as to how he awarded a lump sum amount of Rs.23,48,116/-.
10. However, considering the facts and circumstances of this case and the fact that the dispute between the parties has been pending since, 1978, we think the better course will be to direct payment of the amounts arising against the claims made by the appellant except Claim Nos. 1 and 5 and those amount shall be paid to the extent of 75 per cent.We are deducting this amount bearing in mind the mode adopted by the Arbitrator. The amount payable thereon shall carry interest from the date of the decree made by the Civil Court at 12 per cent per annum. The order of the High Court and the decree of the trial court stand modified in the manner stated above. The appeals shall stand disposed of accordingly
Appeals disposed of.
