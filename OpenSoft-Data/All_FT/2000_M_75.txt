The order of the court was as follows:
1.  There are 10 writ petitioners in this petition who seek a mandamus for allocating the site at Pushpa Market, Lajpat Nagar facing IInd D-Block on Feroz Gandhi Road, New Delhi after removing the respondents from the said site. Learned counsel for the MCD points out that the cases of these 10 persons were rejected by the MCD and against the said order of rejection appeals have been preferred before Mr. R.C. Chopra, Additional District and Sessions Judge, Delhi and the appeals were dismissed on 20.12.1999. A list of the persons whose cases have been dismissed by Mr. Chopra has been placed before us and we find that the names of the petitioners are contained in the list.
2. According to the earlier order of this Court the Chopra Committee's orders would be final and could not be questioned before the Court.
The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
