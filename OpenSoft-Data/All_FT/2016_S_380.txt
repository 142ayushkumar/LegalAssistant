1. Delay condoned. Leave granted.
2. Heard the learned counsel.
3. Looking at the fact that in a similar case, the amount of compensation had already been enhanced by this court, we do not think it necessary to issue notice to the other side for passing a final order.
4. We clarify that if the respondent-State has any grievance, it would be open to the State to approach this court for modification of this order.
5. By an order dated 15th January, 2014, passed in Civil Appeal Nos.738-748 of 2014 (connected appeals with Civil Appeal No.331/2014 (Paramjit Panag & Ors. Vs. State of Pubjab), which pertains to similar land, compensation has been enhanced by Rs.1 lakh (Rupees One Lakh only) per acre. In view of the said order, compensation is enhanced in the same terms as has been done in Civil Appeal Nos.738-748/2014. However, we clarify that this appeal has been filed with a delay of about two years, which is caused by the appellants and therefore, no interest, even statutory interest, shall be paid in respect of the said period.
6. In view of the afore-stated directions, the civil appeal is disposed of with no order as to costs. Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.
Appeal disposed of
