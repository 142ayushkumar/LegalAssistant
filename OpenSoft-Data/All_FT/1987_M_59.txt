Navrattan Singh Chauhan and Others v Mandi Director, U. P. and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 April 1987
Special Leave Petitions (C) Nos. 147-151 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. As the respondent U. P. Rajya Krishi Utpadhan Mandi Parishad has complied with the direction of the High Court for reconsideration of the cases of the petitioners before the High Court for absorption to the posts of Mandi Secretaries in the Centralised Services as provided by Regulation 19 of the U. P. Agricultural Produce Market Committee (Centralised) Service Regulations 1984, the questions raised in these petitions no longer survive. That apart, even on merits we cannot share the view expressed by the High Court that the Com- mittee appointed under Regulation 19 of the Service Regulations had no power to delegate the function of selection of candidates to a Member. Indeed, the High Court should not have entertained the writ petition much less interfered with the selection of candidates. Be that as it may, the direction of the High Court having been complied with, the questions raised are now purely academic.
The Committee will now pronounce the list of the selected candidates made pursuant to the direction of the High Court within ten days from today. If the petitioners are aggrieved by the selection, they are at liberty to resort to such remedy as they may have under the law.
2. Special leave petitions are dismissed accordingly.
Petitions dismissed.
