Varinderpal Singh v Hon'Ble Mr. Justice M. R. Sharma and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 June 1982
W.P. (Criminal) No. 769 of 1982.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
This is a writ petition in a matter where petition for special leave against the judgment of the High Court has already been dismissed by this Court.
The petitioner has now chosen to file this application u/art. 32 of the Constitution. On the face of it the petition is not maintainable.
1. There is not even a semblance of a question of law or an error of jurisdiction. There is not even a remote justification for filing this petition. It is a pity that the time of this Court which is becoming acutely precious because of the piling arrears has to be wasted on hearing such petitions.
Perhaps many such petitions may be avoided if learned counsel who are officers of the court and who are expected to assist the court tender proper advice to their clients. I appeal to members of the Bar to realise that the great burden of dispensing justice is a burden which it is their duty to share and it is their duty to see that the burden should not be needlessly made unbearable.
2. The Judges of this Court are struggling bravely against the odds to tackle the problem of dispensing quick justice. But, without the co-operation of the gentlemen of the Bar, nothing can be done. I appeal to the members of the Bar for their goodwill and co-operation. If we are not able to co-operate and set our house in order, the people to whom all of us are accountable will surely intervene and ask wiser men than us to tell us what is good for us all.
Please do co-operate. The petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
