Mihir Ray v Iind Land Acquisition Collector and Others
Supreme Court of India

29 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4391/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard.
1.  After hearing Mr. Dave for the petitioner and Mr. Altaf Ahmad, the learned Additional Solicitor General for the State of West Bengal and in view of the fact that the acquisition in question is for having a school in Calcutta, instead of striking down the acquisition notification, we thought it appropriate as to whether it would be better to award some compensation which we assess at Rs.2.5 crores.
2. The learned A.S.G. wants time to obtain instructions from the State Government. Put up this matter for orders on 14.12.2000.
Order accordingly.
