1.  This appeal arises out of the judgment and order passed by the Patna High Court in Criminal appeal No. 201 of 1992.
2.  Having gone through the evidence of P.W. 2 and other witnesses and also the judgment of the High Court, we do not find any infirmity either in the evidence of P.W. 2 - Arti Devi or in appreciation of her evidence by the Courts below.
This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
