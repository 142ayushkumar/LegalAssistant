Tata Chemicals Limited v Collector of Central Excise
Supreme Court of India

4 August 2010
Civil Appeal Nos. 7251-7302 of 2000 with Civil Appeal No. 2988 of 2006
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. In view of paragraphs 12 and 17 of the judgment of Three-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Triveni Glass Limited vs. Union of India and Ors., reported in 2005 (3) SCC 484 2005 Indlaw SC 115, we are of the view that the assumption made in the referral Order dated 23rd March, 2006, to the effect that the decision of this Court in Triveni Glass Limited 2005 Indlaw SC 115 (supra) is in conflict with the judgment of another Bench of this Court in Mahalakshmi Glass Works (P) Limited vs. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay, reported in 1988 (Supp) SCC 601 1988 Indlaw SC 794, is erroneous. On the contrary, the judgment of this Court in Triveni Glass Limited 2005 Indlaw SC 115 (supra) in turn follows the judgment in Mahalakshmi Glass Works (P) Limited 2005 Indlaw SC 115 (supra).
2. For the above reasons, the Order of reference dated 23rd March, 2006, is set aside and consequently, the civil appeals will be heard by the appropriate Bench in accordance with law. All arguments on merits on both sides are kept open.
