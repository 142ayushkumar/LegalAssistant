State of Haryana and Others v Ram Atri and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 March 1997
S.L.P.(C) No. 1014 of 1997 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 24 May 1996 in W.P. No. 15062 of 1995 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. During the hearing of this petition our attention was invited by learned counsel for the petitioners to the judgment in State of Punjab v. Om Parkash Kaushal 1996 Indlaw SC 2947 decided by a two-Judge Bench of this Court on 8-7-1996.
2. Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, invited our attention to the judgment in State of Haryana v. Rajpal Sharma1996 Indlaw SC 2909 decided by a two-Judge Bench on 25-7-1996. In the later judgment, the earlier judgment of 8-7-1996 Indlaw SC 2947 has not been noticed and the views taken in both the judgments run counter to each other.
3. It is, therefore, necessary to resolve the conflict.
Let the matter be placed before a three-Judge Bench.
Order accordingly.
