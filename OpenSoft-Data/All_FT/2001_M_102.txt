Madan Mohan Asthana v State of Jharkhand
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3276/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave is granted.
1.  Since the appellant-accused has been acquitted in the criminal case in which he had deposited a sum of Rs.55,000/- as a condition for grant of bail there is no reason why the said amount should not be refunded to him after disposal of the case. The High Court was clearly in error in dismissing the appellants' application for refund of amount in his favour.
2. The order passed on 27.2.2001 in CRWJC No.5/01. It is relevant to note here that the order passed with the Sessions Court judgment that the amount shall be deposited by the accused disposed of on the merits of the case does not mean that after acquittal in the case the said amount shall not be refunded to the accused. Accordingly the High Court order is set aside and the said amount shall be refunded to the appellant forthwith.The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
