The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
3. By the impugned order, the Division Bench of the High Court has passed an interim order directing the appellant - husband to pay an amount of Rs.5,000/- to the respondent - wife from the date of the petition, namely, 8th September, 2006, till October, 2007, and, thereafter, to continue to pay the same every month.
4. On behalf of the appellant, it is submitted that at the relevant time when the order was passed, the appellant had produced a Certificate from the Institution in which he was employed, to indicate that he was receiving a total salary of Rs. 5,440/- and in- spite of the same, the impugned order was passed directing him to pay Rs.5,000/- by way of maintenance to the respondent.
During the hearing of the appeal, the appellant has produced a further Certificate showing the present salary being drawn by him from Vigyan Degree College, in which he was working as a Lecturer in the English department. From the Certificate which has been issued on 9th April, 2009, it appears that the appellant is being paid a salary of Rs. 9910/- per month.
5. It has also been pointed out by the respondent that the appellant owns other properties and the income therefrom was not taken into consideration. On the other hand, on behalf of the appellant it is submitted that the respondent also runs a school and the income therefrom has also not been taken into consideration while granting maintenance to the appellant.
6. Having regard to the above, we set aside the order passed by the High Court and direct the High Court to consider the matter afresh in the light of the fresh materials which have been produced and which may be produced on behalf of the respondent.
7. In the meantime, as an interim measure, the appellant will pay to the respondent-wife maintenance at the reduced rate of Rs.2500/- per month from the month of May, 2009.
8. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of
