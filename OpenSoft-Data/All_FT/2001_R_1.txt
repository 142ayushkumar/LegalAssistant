Dir. of Teacher Education v R Uma and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 December 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7254/1999
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  Respondent No. 1 had been admitted for the academic year 1999-2000 in Teachers' Training course in second respondent's institution pursuant to the order made by the High Court under appeal.
2.  This Court made an order while directing issue of notice on 27.10.1999 to maintain status quo inasmuch as she had already been admitted in the institution and that position should have been continued.
3. In that view of the matter we do not think it would be appropriate to interfere with the order made by the High Court and this appeal shall stand disposed of without expressing any opinion on the question of law raised in this matter.
Appeal disposed of.
