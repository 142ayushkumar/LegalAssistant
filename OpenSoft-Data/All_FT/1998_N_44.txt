National Textile Corporation Limited v Yasmin Rustum Lentin and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 January 1998
C.A. No. 1538/1996 with C.A. No. 1539/1996, Dt. 9 January 1998.
The Judgment was delivered by:  J.S. VERMA, J.
1. The subject matter of dispute surviving in these appeals relates to half of the back wages for a period of three years from 1983 to 1986 to respondent No.1 in the these two appeals. No doubt several questions of law have been raised in these appeals requiring decision but the final question to be answered is limited to the extent indicated.
2.  We are also informed that these two employees-respondent No.1 in these two appeals have also been taken into employment in 1986 pursuant to this Court's order and they are continuing in service.
3. This being so, we do not consider it necessary to decide the question of law raised in these appeals which we leave open for decision in an appropriate case and in view of the limited subject matter of the appeals we do not deem it fit to interfere with the judgment under appeal. The appeals are dismissed for this reason. No costs.
Appeals disposed of.
