2 April 1991
Transfer Petition (C) Nos. 93 & 94 of 1989 in W.P. (C) No. 320 of 1987
The Order of the Court is as follows
1. These transfer petitions are for the transfer or Civil Writ Petition No. 1001 of 1988 pending in the High Court of Delhi and Reference I.D. No. 17 of 1988 pending before the Presiding Officer, Industrial Tribunal No. III, Delhi. In the light of our judgment in D. T. C. Workers' Union v. D. T. C.
