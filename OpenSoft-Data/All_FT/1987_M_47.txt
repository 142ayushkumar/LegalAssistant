Major Dharam Paul Sood v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 December 1987
W.P. (Criminal) No. 1804 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this matter notice was issued on November 30, 1984 limited to the question as to why the period during which the petitioner was in detention prior to the date of conviction should not be set off against the sentence imposed upon him.
2.  The petitioner was convicted and sentenced to four years' rigorous imprisonment by the court material on September 24, 1983. On September 24, 1987, four years have been completed apart from the remissions, if any, which may have been earned by the petitioner while in custody.
3.   In view of this as the petitioner must have been set at liberty after completion of his sentence, this petition has become infructuous and is, therefore, dismissed as having become infructuous.
Petition dismissed.
