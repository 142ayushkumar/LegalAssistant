Review Petition(Cr.) No. 859/2001 in S.L.P.(Cr.)No. 683/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay in filing the review petition is condoned.
1.  There was a delay of 3061 days in filing the Special Leave Petition, but as the petitioners are in jail, in the interest of justice we looked into the merits of the matter and were satisfied that no interference was called for and accordingly dismissed the S.L.P.
2.  We have perused the review petition and the order under review. The ground on which the review of our order in the S.L.P. is sought, would not warrant review or modification of the order.
The review petition is therefore dismissed.
Review dismissed.
