Rakesh Chandra Narayan and others v State of Bihar and others
Supreme Court of India

11 November 1997
W.Ps. (C) Nos. 339 of 1986, 901 of 1993 and 448 of 1994 with No. 80 of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This matter pertains to the functioning of the Agra, Gwalior and Ranchi mental asylums. We have today made an order in Upendra Baxi (Dr.) v. State of U.P. 1997 Indlaw SC 1647 requesting the National Human Rights Commission to be involved in the supervision of the functioning of the Agra Protective Home in the manner indicated in the order. We are of the opinion that the same kind of order needs to be made in this matter also relating to Agra, Ranchi and Gwalior asylums.
2. Accordingly, we request the National Human Rights Commission to perform this exercise in the same manner. The general directions given in our order made in Dr. Upendra Baxi (supra) would also be equally applicable in the present case. A copy of this order together with a copy of the order in Dr. Upendra Baxi 1997 Indlaw SC 1647 (supra) and other relevant orders and papers of this matter indicated by Mr Muralidhar, be sent by the Registry to the National Human Rights Commission.
3.  We also place on record our appreciation to learned amicus curiae, Mr S. Muralidhar, for the assistance rendered to the Court in these proceedings and his offer to assist the National Human Rights Commission also hereafter. We are sure that the Commission will appreciate his assistance in performance of this exercise.
Order accordingly.
