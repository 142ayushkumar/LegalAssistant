U.P. Public Service Commission and Another v Surya Mani Tripathi and Another
Supreme Court of India

6 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19189/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  In the instant case, the applications of the respondents were rejected by the appellants on the ground that they were either incomplete or there were some other errors.
2.  The High Court, in a very perfunctory manner, has set aside the decision merely by observing that human beings commit errors and therefore the petitions should be allowed and the respondents herein be permitted to correct the errors.
3.  The High Court does not consider the rules, regulations or the terms of the examination. It does not consider what are the errors which are committed; whether they are serious, major or minor. Each case should have been considered by the High Court separately after determining whether the requirement of filling in the Form correctly was mandatory or not.
4. We, therefore, allow the appeals, set aside the decisions of the High Court and remand these cases to the High Court to decide the writ petitions afresh.
Appeals allowed.
