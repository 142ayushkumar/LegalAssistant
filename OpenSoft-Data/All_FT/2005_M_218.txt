Al-Karim Educational Trust and another v Medical Council of India and others
Supreme Court of India

29 August 2005
W.P. (C) No. 167 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  According to the petitioners, two committees - Admission Committee and Fee Fixation Committee constituted by the State Government, in terms of the notification dated 16-6-2005 are not functional. It is pointed out that the State Government has neither issued separate order in terms of the said notification nor appointed other members of the Committees. There is nothing on record to show that these Committees are operational.
2.  Under these circumstances, the candidates named in the list sent by the State Government shall be granted admission on their payment of the fee according to the petitioner College, subject to further directions that may be made by the Fee Fixation Committee which, we hope, the State Government would make it operational in terms of the law laid down by this Court in P.A. Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra  2005 Indlaw SC 463.
3. In case, those who are named in the list do not join, it would be open to the petitioners to proceed in accordance with law.
Interlocutory application is disposed of accordingly.
List the writ petition after four weeks.
Order accordingly.
