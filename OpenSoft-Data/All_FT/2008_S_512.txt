The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Taking note of the fact in a news item published in 'The Times of India', Ahmedabad Edition, dated May 2, 2006 to the effect that 1200 temples and 260 Islamic shrines had encroached on public space, the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad, while taking suo motu action, issued notice to the fourteen persons/authorities who were arrayed as Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No(s).8519/2006 respondents. While doing so, the High Court gave the following interim direction:
"Meanwhile, all the respondents are directed to take immediate steps for removal of encroachment of religious structures on the public space without any discrimination and submit their reports."
