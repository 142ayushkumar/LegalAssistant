Narendra Dalal and others v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2009
Cr.MP.No. 14636-14637/2009 and Cr.A. No(s). 1553-1554 of 2009
1. On 13 August, 2009, we had set aside the order of the High Court rejecting the petitioners' prayer for grant of anticipatory bail and had directed the petitioners to surrender before the learned Metropolitan the Magistrate, Rohtak, Haryana, on 24 August, 2009, with a further direction to the learned Judge to release the petitioners on bail to his satisfaction.
2. These applications have now been filed in the two criminal appeals, which were disposed of, on account of a communication sent by the Registry to the court concerned. It appears that the learned Judicial Magistrate wanted a confirmation of the order of bail passed by this Court and whether it pertained to FIR No.114 of 2008, PS Urban State, Rohtak, (Haryana) under Sections 420, 506, 34 IPC.
It appears further from the said order that it was telephonically confirmed that the order of bail passed by this Court was in respect of the said FIR. However, it appears that the FIR No. in respect of which bail had been granted is FIR No.144 rd dated 3 June, 2008, under Sections 420, 506 and 448 IPC and not as described in the order of the learned Judicial Magistrate.
3. Let our order of 13 August, 2009, be clarified that the same has been passed in respect of FIR No.144 dated rd 3 June, 2008, under Sections 420, 506, 448 IPC of P.S. Urban Estate, Rohtak, Haryana.
4. The applications for further directions are disposed of accordingly.
