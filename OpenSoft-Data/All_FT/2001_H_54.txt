State of Himachal Pradesh and Anr v Hari Singh
Supreme Court of India

23 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)..../2001 (CC:1123)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Apart from the delay in filing the special leave petition of more than 1100 days, there has been a delay in refiling the special leave petition of 412 days. I.A. 1 and I.A. 2 have been filed seeking condonation of delay in filing and refiling of the special leave petition.
2.  In I.A. No.2, which seeks condonation of delay in refiling the special leave petition, the only ground on which condonation is sought is contained of the application which reads thus:
"That the Advocate for the petitioner had in the meanwhile sent his memo of expenses to the office of the District Attorney for filing the 110 connected special leave petitions. The District Attorney in turn had sent the same to Shimla for sanction and clearance. Due to the fact that a large number of matters were filed at the same time, the amount of expenses claimed by the advocate, though at the same scale as was being claimed by him in other matter, came to a large amount. This became a matter of some unwarranted objections by the officials of the state government. As the advocate had already spent a huge amount from his own pocket, and the removal of expenses could not be undertaken till the settlement of the matter."
3.  We are afraid that this explanation does not give any sufficient cause much less a reasonable cause for condonation of delay in refiling. We are also not satisfied with the explanation for inordinate delay in filing the S.L.P. Both the applications are, accordingly, rejected.
Consequently, the special leave petition is dismissed as barred by time.
Petition dismissed.
