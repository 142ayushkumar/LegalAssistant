Government of Andhra Pradesh and Others v N. Subbarayudu and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 March 2008
Civil Appeal No. 3939-3941 of 2002 with C. A. no.3983/2004
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  These appeals have been preferred by the State against the judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court. By the impugned order, the High Court directed that the respondents be paid the pensionary benefits from the respective date of their retirement under the provisions of Pension Rules 1980. We have heard the parties at length.
Briefly stated the facts are as follows.
2.  The respondents were Lecturers in private aided college. The age of superannuation of the respondents was 60 years. By an amendment of the Education Code in 1993, the age of superannuation of the respondents has been brought down to 58 years. In the said amendment it was also provided that the respondents shall be entitled to pension with effect from 1st November 1992.
3. Aggrieved thereby, the respondents preferred writ petition before the High Court. The Division Bench of the High Court, after hearing the parties, was of the view that the cutoff date 1/11/1992 fixed by the Government was arbitrary and discriminatory.
4.  In a catena of decisions of this Court it has been held that the cutoff date is fixed by the executive authority keeping in view the economic conditions, financial constraints and many other administrative and other attending circumstances. This Court is also of the view that fixing cut off dates is within the domain of the executive authority and the Court should not normally interfere with the fixation of cutoff date by the executive authority unless such order appears to be on the face of it blatantly discriminatory and arbitrary. (See State of Punjab & Ors. vs. Amar Nath Goyal & Ors., (2005) 6 SCC 754 2005 Indlaw SC 477). No doubt in D.S. Nakara & Ors. vs. Union of India 1983(1) SCC 305 1982 Indlaw SC 158 this Court had struck down the cutoff date in connection with the demand of pension. However, in subsequent decisions this Court has considerably watered down the rigid view taken in Nakara's Case 1982 Indlaw SC 158 (supra), as observed in the decision of this Court in State of Punjab & Ors. vs. Amar Nath Goyal & Ors. 2005 Indlaw SC 477 (supra).
5.  There may be various considerations in the mind of the executive authorities due to which a particular cutoff date has been fixed. These considerations can be financial, administrative or other considerations. The Court must exercise judicial restraint and must ordinarily leave it to the executive authorities to fix the cutoff date. The Government must be left with some leeway and free play at the joints in this connection. In fact several decisions of this Court have gone to the extent of saying that the choice of a cutoff date cannot be dubbed as arbitrary even if no particular reason is given for the same in the counter affidavit filed by the Government, (unless it is shown to be totally capricious or whimsical) vide State of Bihar vs. Ramjee Prasad 1990(3) SCC 368 1990 Indlaw SC 869, Union of Indian & Anr. vs. Sudhir Kumar Jaiswal 1994 (4) SCC 212 1994 Indlaw SC 1471 , Ramrao & Ors. vs. All India Backward Class Bank Employees Welfare Association & Ors. 2004 (2) SCC 76 2004 Indlaw SC 38, University Grants Commission vs. Sadhana Chaudhary & Ors. 1996(10) SCC 536 1996 Indlaw SC 3861, etc.
6. It follows, therefore, that even if no reason has been given in the counter affidavit of the Government or the executive authority as to why a particular cut off date has been chosen, the Court must still not declare that date to be arbitrary and violative of Article 14 unless the said cut off date leads to some blatantly capricious or outrageous result.
7.  As has been held by this Court in Divisional Manager, Aravali Golf Club & Anr. vs. Chander Hass & Anr. 2008(3) 3 JT 221 2007 Indlaw SC 1275 and in Government of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. vs. Smt. P. Laxmi Devi 2008(2) 8 JT 639 2008 Indlaw SC 245 the Court must maintain judicial restraint in matters relating to the legislative or executive domain.
8.  For the reasons afore-stated, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside. The appeals are allowed.
Appeals allowed
