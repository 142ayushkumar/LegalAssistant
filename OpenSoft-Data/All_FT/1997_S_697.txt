Dr. Banwarilal Sharma v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 December 1997
Transferred Case (Cr.) No. 15 of 1991
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In the FIR registered against the petitioner on 28-7-1986 for an offence u/s. 309 IPC, what is alleged is that the writ petitioner had undertaken a "fast unto death". The challenge to the registration of the FIR in the writ petition was primarily on the ground that S. 309 IPC, i.e., attempt to commit suicide, is ultra vires the Constitution. This issue is no longer res integra. The Constitution Bench of this Court in Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab  1996 Indlaw SC 6621996 Indlaw SC 662 (batch of cases) has categorically ruled that S. 309 IPC is not constitutionally invalid. The Bench has held that Art. 21 of the Constitution does not include therein the "right to die".
2.   In this view of the matter, keeping in view the allegations made in the first information report, we are not inclined to interfere in this petition.
The writ petition is, therefore, dismissed but there shall be no order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.
