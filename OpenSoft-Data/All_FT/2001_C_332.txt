Commissioner, Kanpur Division and Anr v Vishnu Avtar Chaturvedi and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14400/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The interim order dated 25th July, 2001 as well as subsequent order initiating contempt proceedings are under challenge in these SLPs. Learned Solicitor General states that on 26th July 2001 an application has been filed for modifying the order dated 25th July, 2001, and in that application relevant materials have been filed to indicate that the respondent does not belong to the common cadre personnel.
2. But instead of disposing of that matter, the High Court initiated contempt proceedings. The order dated 25th July 2001 appears to have been passed as no material could be produced pursuance to the order dated 24th July 2001.
3.  In these circumstances, we set aside the initiation of the contempt proceedings in the matter, but we direct that the application filed on 26th July 2001 may be taken up immediately for being disposed of on merits, more so when the respondent is due to retire at the end of the month.
The SLPs. are disposed of accordingly.
Petitions disposed of.
