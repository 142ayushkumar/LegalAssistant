Mohammad Aziz Rahaman And Ors. v Asst. Commissioner And Land Acqn.Officer
Supreme Court of India

31 January 2002
CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 4437-4443 OF 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. A large tract of land measuring 88 acres, 11 guntas situated within the municipal limits of Shahpur in the district of Gulberga, was proposed to be acquired by the Government of Karnataka, for establishing a Government Degree College. For that purpose, a notification u/s. 4 was issued on 10th March, 1988. The said notification was followed by declaration u/s. 6 of the Act, issued on 20th April, 1988. The appellant's land was covered by the aforesaid notifications. The land acquisition officer awarded compensation to the appellants at the rate of Rs. 6,800 per acre. The appellants were not satisfied with the said order of compensation. For that purpose, they sought reference before the civil court. The learned Civil Judge enhanced the compensation to Rs. 1,05,000 per acre. Aggrieved, the State of Karnataka preferred a first appeal before the High Court.
The High Court arrived at the market value of the acquired land at the rate of Rs. 78,750 per acre and thereafter deducted 53 per cent out of the said amount towards development charges. With the result, the compensation that was made payable to the appellants was Rs. 37,013 per acre. Aggrieved, the appellants preferred this appeal.
2. Learned counsel for the appellants urged that the view taken by the High Court in reducing the compensation was contrary to the evidence on record and, therefore, the judgment under challenge deserves to be set aside. We find substance in the argument. It may be noted that before the High Court, the claimants relied upon two judgments of the High Court for arriving at the market value of the acquired land. The first judgment of the High Court was with reference to notification dated 7.9.1978. In the said judgment, the High Court fixed the market value of the land adjoining to the acquired land at the rate of Rs. 52,500 per acre after deducting 50% of the retail value on the method of valuation adopted therein. The said judgment was affirmed by this Court. The second judgment of the High Court was with respect to the land adjoining to the acquired land with reference to notification dated 29.8.1983. In the said judgment, the High Court adopted 1978 market rate as the basis for fixing the market value of the acquired land and added 7% of the rise in value of land from 1978 to 1983. Thus, the market value of the land acquired was arrived at Rs. 71,000 per acre. This judgment was accepted by the State Government and was not appealed against.
3. In the present case, we find that there was a constant trend of upward rise in the price of land since 1978 to 1988. If we adopt 1983 market value of the land as the basis for arriving at the market value of the acquired land and add 5% instead of 7% upward rise in price of the land, the market value of the acquired land in the year 1988 would be nearly Rs. 95,000 per acre. This is not disputed by the parties. We are, therefore of the view that the market value of the acquired land on the date of notification issued u/s. 4 of the Act in the year 1988 was Rs. 95,000 per acre. In that view of the matter, the judgment of the High Court deserves to be set aside. We order accordingly.
4. The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed
