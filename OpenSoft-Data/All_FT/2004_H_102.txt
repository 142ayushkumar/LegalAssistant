Hemkant Jha v State of Bihar and others
Supreme Court of India

3 September 2004
C.As. No. 5845 of 2004 ((Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 16900 of 2003) with Nos. 5846-59 of 2004 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 17667, 17666, 17662, 17659, 17672, 17674, 17677-79, 17684, 17680,17687 of 2003, 482 and 9790 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  These special leave petitions have been filed by persons who had been employed in the Police Department in the State of Bihar as constables. Their services were terminated by a series of orders. These orders of termination were challenged by several writ petitions. Some of the writ petitions were heard and disposed of by a learned Judge who is also a party to the decision on the appeal preferred by the appellants from his decision. This is entirely unacceptable.
2. It goes without saying that a judge who hears and decides a matter while sitting singly should not participate in any manner whatsoever in the appeal from his order. The decision of the Division Bench is set aside on this ground alone and the matter is remanded back to the High Court for being heard and disposed of by a Bench of Judges who had not dealt with these writ petitions sitting singly. The High Court is requested to dispose of the appeals as expeditiously as is conveniently possible.
The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
3.  The IAs are treated as in fructuous and no orders are passed thereon,  Arising out of SLP (C) No.16900 of 2003.
Appeals disposed of.
