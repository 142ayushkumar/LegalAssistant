8 September 1995
C.A. Nos. 7463-7464 of 1995, (Arising as an appeal from 1994 (71) E.L.T. 601 (Tribunal)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr. A. N. Haksar, the learned counsel for the appellant says that after the disposal of the appeal by the Tribunal, the office of the General Manager, District Industries Centre, Thane, issued a letter dated 13-6-1994 to the appellant, stating that the appellant-unit is entitled to "SSI" status from the date of application for registration, namely, the year 1979.
2. This letter refers to a SSI Registration Certificate granted on 4-12-1992, which says that the appellant-unit has commenced the production from 3-11-1975.
3.  Admittedly, both these documents were not filed before the Tribunal. We cannot look into the documents which have not been filed before the Tribunal and particularly when one of them has been issued subsequent to the decision of the Tribunal. It is open to the appellant to approach the Tribunal and ask for reconsideration of its orders in the light of the said documents, if he is so advised, according to law.
The appeals are dismissed with the aforesaid observations.
Appeals dismissed.
