The Order of the Court was as follows:

2. It is open to the petitioner to bring it to the notice of the High Court instead of travelling all the way from Patna to Delhi for this purpose.
3.  Mr. Gopal Subramanian, learned senior counsel submits that petitioner would be advised to do so. He, therefore, seeks permission to withdraw this Special Leave Petition.
Accordingly, SLP is dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
