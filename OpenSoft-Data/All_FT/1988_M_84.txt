Mukesh Kumar v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

8 February 1988
W.P. (Civil) No. 1290 of 1987 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard counsel for the petitioner.
1.  In spite of service of notice, there is no return. On the facts alleged, we are of the view that the stand taken by the petitioner that he was not aware of the pendency of the criminal case when he filled up the attestation form, is perhaps correct.
In the absence of any counter-affidavit challenging the position, the contention of the petitioner is accepted.
2.   The writ petition is allowed and the termination order is quashed. The petitioner is entitled to restoration of service with all attendant benefits. No costs.
Petition allowed.
