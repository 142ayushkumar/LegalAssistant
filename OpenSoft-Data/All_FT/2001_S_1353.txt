Vijay Kumar Chopra and Others v Sudarshan Chopra and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16255/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have perused the order dated 22nd October, 2001 passed by the High Court.
2.  Without expressing any opinion on the merits or justification of the order dated 22/10/2001, we would like to clarify that the SLP, filed before this Court, has not been entertained so far and on 5/10/2001 the hearing was simply adjourned as the matter before the High Court was coming up for hearing on 22/10/2001 as appointed by the High Court itself. We further clarify that filing of this SLP in this Court does not exclude the High Court from hearing the matter before it and rather we request the High Court to do so.
3.  We would appreciate the High Court taking up the matter before it at the earliest and in any case within a period of two months from today, subject to a mention being made before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice or the Bench seized of the hearing and hear on the objection as to maintainability of the appeal raised by the respondents in the High Court and also to hear on the application seeking vacating/setting aside/recalling of the interim order dated 22/8/2001 and dispose of these two issues by a reasoned order. In the event of the appeal being held not maintainable, it would be an end of the matter before the High Court.
4. However, if the High Court may hold the appeal to be maintainable, it may appoint a date for hearing on its merits, consistently with its calendar and keeping in view the urgency of the matter Learned counsel for respondent No.1, who is appellant in the High Court, assures that the prayer for early hearing on the above two issues shall not be opposed and the matter would be argued without making a prayer for adjournment.
List after two months.
Order accordingly.
