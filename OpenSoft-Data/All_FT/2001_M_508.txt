Municipal Corporation, Gwalior v Satish Govila and Another
Supreme Court of India

19 April 2001
C.A. No. 4963/1997 with C.A. No. 4964/1997, Dt. 19 April 2001.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These proceedings arise out of an award made by the Labour Court which stood affirmed. The appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India for quashing the award. The question is that what should be the scale of pay in which respondent No. 1 should be fitted. The Labour Court on examination of facts found that he had been preparing a lay out plan and monograms and in addition he was also doing some painting work.
2. Therefore, it was found that respondent No. 1 would fall into the category of designer rather than a painter. In the facts and circumstances of the case when the Labour Court having come to that conclusion we do not see any reason for us to interfere with the order made by the High Court affirming that of the award made by the Labour Court. We therefore, decline to interfere with the order of the High Court.
3.  The appeals are therefore dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
