Narain Prasad Gupta v State Of Rajasthan & Anr
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2002
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal(Cr.)......./2002
The order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.
1.  In our view, the impugned order passed by the High Court does not call for interference as the prosecution is pending since 1983. It is the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that other two directors are already discharged and there is no reason for continuing prosecution against the petitioner.
2. For this purpose, High Court has taken care and has directed to conclude the trial expeditiously as possible. The revisional court has also made a specific observation to that effect.
3.  In this view of the matter at this stage the prosecution which is launched in 1983 does not require any further interference by this Court.
4. However, it is made clear that if petitioner files proper application for exemption from personal appearance during the trial, the court would consider the same and grant it on the condition that on his behalf counsel would remain present on each and every date of posting.
With these observations, the special leave petition is rejected.
Petition dismissed.
