Ram Kishan v State of Rajasthan and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18327/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  This appeal has been filed against the judgment dated 16th August, 2000 whereby the Division Bench of the High Court declined to entertain the appeal against the judgment of the Single Judge who had dismissed the appellant's writ petition.
2.  We have gone through the judgment of the Single Judge and the documents on record and in our opinion this was not a fit case where the Special Appeal should have been dismissed by the Division Bench in limini.
3. We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the aforesaid decision dated 16th August, 2000 and direct the High Court to hear the Special Appeal on merits.
Appeal allowed.
