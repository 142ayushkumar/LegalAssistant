Balbir Singh v Harbhajan Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2003
S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 4420 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard parties.
1.  The High Court has quashed proceedings against Respondent Nos. 1 to 9 by a one paragraph order. The only reason given by the High Court is:
"Having regard to relationship of petitioners with the complainant and the nature of allegations made."
2.  We fail to understand how relationship, by itself, can be a basis for quashing proceedings. Looking to the complaint, we also fail to understand how the nature of allegations requires quashing of proceedings.
In our view, this is no way to quash proceedings. It is well settled law that normally proceedings cannot be quashed unless very strong grounds are made out. If the High Court feels that strong grounds have been made out, it should set out in detail what those grounds are, in respect of each of the accused persons, which require quashing of the proceedings against that accused.
3.  We, therefore, set aside the impugned order. Remit the petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure back to the High Court for disposal on merits uninfluenced by observations made herein.
4.  Order dated 17th August, 2002 granting regular bail to Respondent No.1 and anticipatory bail to Respondent Nos. 2 to 9 shall continue pending disposal of the petition before the High Court.
The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
