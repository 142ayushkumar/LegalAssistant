State of Uttar Pradesh v Devi Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 326/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The respondents were tried for an offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and certain other counts of offences. The trial court acquitted the respondents.
2. Against the order of acquittal, the State moved the High Court for leave to appeal. The Division Bench of the High Court rejected the application for leave without specifying any reason at all.
3.  On the fact situation we feel that the High Court should have granted leave and disposed of the appeal on merits. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order. The leave applied for would stand granted. As the appeal before the High Court has now become regularised, the same can be disposed of on merits after affording reasonable opportunity of hearing to both sides.
This appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
Appeal disposed of.
