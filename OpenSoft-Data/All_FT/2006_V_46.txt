The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Though Mr Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate for Respondents 2 to 5 raised objection as to maintainability of the petition stating that bona fides of the petitioner are not established, at this juncture, we do not consider it necessary to go into the details on that aspect. The basic issue involved is alleged investments and sources for such investments. Let Respondents 2 to 5 file copies of the income tax and wealth tax returns, if any, filed before the authorities of the said respondents along with details which accompanied the returns, if they were filed and copies of orders, if any, passed by the statutory authorities, within four weeks. Such details shall be filed for the income tax/wealth tax Assessment Years 2001-2002, 2002-2003, 2003-2004, 2004- 2005, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007.

We are informed by the learned counsel for Respondents 2 to 5 that notices have been issued by the Income Tax Authorities for some of the aforesaid periods calling for information's in terms of Section 133(6) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short "the Act"). The proceedings pursuant to those notices may continue untrammelled by the fact that the present writ petition is pending and we have asked for certain details to be filed.
