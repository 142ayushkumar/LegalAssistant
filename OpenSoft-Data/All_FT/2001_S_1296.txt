Pramod Kumar Prasad Shaw v State of West Bengal Service and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9201/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petition stated that the matter might be disposed of at this stage by an order setting aside the order under challenge and restoring the writ petition to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits.
2.  The High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the present appellant on the ground that it was a public interest litigation in which the removal of unauthorised occupants was involved.
3. The High Court took the view that there was no need to interfere in the public interest litigation. It did not find any merit in the public interest litigation and, accordingly, dismissed it.
4.  We have read the writ petition that was filed before the High Court. It is clear therefrom that it is not a public interest litigation but a litigation filed by an individual to seek relief for himself.
5. We are, therefore, of the view that the writ petition must be restored to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits. We make it clear that we express no opinion on the merits of the case on either side. It shall be open to the parties to raise all available contentions before the High Court.
6.  The civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The writ petition (Writ Petition No.726 of 1999) is restored to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits.No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
