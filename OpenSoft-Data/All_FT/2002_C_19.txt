Commissioner Of Customs Bangalore v Central Manufacturing Tech. Institute
Supreme Court of India

9 September 2002
C.A. No. 5774 of 2002, Dt. 9 September 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court rejected an application for reference of question of law arising from the order of the CEGAT and the High Court agreed with the view taken by the Tribunal and disposed of the matter stating that the question of law does not arise from the order of the CEGAT. That was not the stage at which the High Court could have expressed its views on merits of the matter and the appropriate course for the High Court was to call for a statement and then decide the matter in an appropriate manner as provided under the law.
2. In that view of the matter, we set aside the order made by the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court for fresh examination. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
