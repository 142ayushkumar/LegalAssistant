Surat Singh v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14724-14725/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Admittedly, 80% of the post of Junior Engineer is to be filled by direct recruitment, 10% post is to be filled in by promotion amongst the diploma holders and the remaining 10% by promotion from amongst the non diploma holders.
2.  The arguments raised was that the quota is against the post and not against the vacancy and since more than 80% of direct recruits are working on the post of Junior Engineer, the vacancy against the 10% posts cannot go to the direct recruits.
On the said argument this Court directed the State of Punjab to file an affidavit indicating therein the number of direct recruits working on the post of Junior Engineer. After the several adjournments, counter affidavit has been filed wherein query that was made by the Court has not been answered.
3. We, therefore, grant leave in this case and direct that respondent State shall not interfere with the working of the appellant on the post of Junior Engineer and further the State Government would also pay all the arrears of salary within three months from today.
Order accordingly.
