Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax (Law), Board of Revenue (Taxes), Ernakulam v R. Viswambharan
Supreme Court of India

9 November 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. We do not see any substance in this appeal. The question was whether 'arrowroot' is vegetable and falls within Entry 10 of the Third Schedule to the Kerala General Sales Tax Act.
2.  The Kerala High Court has held, agreeing with the Tribunal, that it is a vegetable. It has held,
"Arrowroot is one of those vegetable grown both in the kitchen garden and in a farm. It has brisk sales in the market as children's food."
3.  We are of the opinion that the said finding does not require any interference. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
