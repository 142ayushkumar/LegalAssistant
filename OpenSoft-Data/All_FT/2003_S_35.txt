Saamu Singh v State of U.P. & Anr.
Supreme Court of India

13 January 2003
W.P. (Cr.) No. 74 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. The petitioner herein was convicted for offences under section 302 read with sections 149, 147 and 148 of Indian Penal Code and sentence to imprisonment for life. The petitioner while undergoing sentence, was released from jail on 26th January 2000. In a batch of petitions filed before the High Court of Allahabad, the remissions granted in various cases by the State was challenged and the Court held that the convicts who had been released shall be taken into custody and shall be sent to jail to undergo the full sentences awarded to them.
2. The petitioner herein was released from the jail pursuant to the Government orders, which were quashed by the Division Bench. In the present petition, it is alleged that the petitioner had undergone imprisonment for a period of 19 years and 11 days without remissions and with remissions he has undergone 25 years, 11 months and 8 days imprisonment, and that fact is admitted in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent State, Uttar Pradesh. It is stated that the petitioner had completed 25 years including all remissions as on 26.1.2000.
3.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we feel that while releasing the petitioner herein, the State of U.P. was not exercising the power of remissions illegally. In this case as the petitioner had undergone sentence for 19 years without remission, he has been rightly released by the Government, and therefore this petition is allowed and the petitioner be not arrested and taken into custody pursuant to the judgment and order of Division Bench, Allahabad High Court dated 27.9.2001 in CRMWP 5039/2000.
Petition allowed.
