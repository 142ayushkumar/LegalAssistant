Brijendra Mishra v State of Madhya Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17541/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petition stated that the matter might be disposed of at this stage by an order setting aside the order under challenge, condoning the delay in filing the appeal and restoring the appeal to the High Court for fresh disposal, with an order of appropriate costs in favour of the respondents.
2.  The respondents have been served but have not chosen to put in an appearance.
3.  By the order under challenge, the High Court noted that the appeal was barred by eleven days. It did not pass an order on the application for condonation thereof but went on to say that it had considered the order of the learned Single Judge and found no ground to interfere in the appeal.
4.  It would appear that the appeal was dismissed principally on the ground of delay because of the phraseology used thus:
"The appeal is barred by 11 days. We have also gone through the order of the learned Single Judge."
5. In a situation like this, it must be taken that the basic ground on which the appeal was dismissed was the ground of delay. We do not think that a delay of eleven days is such as justified the dismissal of the appeal.
6.  The High Court could have condoned it, making an order for costs in favour of the respondents, and considered the appeal on its merits thereafter.Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed. The order under challenge is set aside. The Letters Patent Appeal (L.P.A. No.332 of 1999) is restored to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits.
7. The appellant will pay to the respondents the costs of this appeal, fixed at Rupees five hundred.
Appeal disposed of.
