Naseem v State of Haryana and others
Supreme Court of India

26 March 2003
S.L.P. (C) No. 4113 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner has been denied admission on the ground that she had passed the qualifying examination from an institution not recognized by the respondent number 2.
2.  We cannot compel an autonomous educational institution to grant admission to a candidate not holding the requisite eligibility qualification from an institution recognized by it. Since the admission has been denied at the very threshold, the applicability of the rule of promissory estoppel is also not attracted. No fault can be found with the view taken by the High Court. The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
