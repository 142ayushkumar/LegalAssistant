1. The Supreme Court is more than a Court of ,appeal. It exercises power only when there is supreme need. It is not the fifth court of appeal but the final court of the nation. Therefore, even if legal flaws may be electronically detected, we cannot interfere sans manifest injustice or substantial question of public importance. By this token, the petitioner has missed the bus. Dismissed.
