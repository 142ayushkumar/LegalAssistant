Commissioner of Income Tax v Smt. Sarita Aggarwal
Supreme Court of India

5 December 2000
C.A. Nos. 6208 to 6212 of 1995 with S.L.P. (C) Nos. 10396 of 1990 & 22685 to 22687 of 1995
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  The High Court rejected the application of the Revenue to call for a reference of two questions on the ground that no question of law arose. The Tribunal, in the Revenue's application under s. 256(1) of the IT Act, had noted that the questions were covered against the Revenue by its earlier decisions, particulars whereof it gave.
2. It also stated that reference applications against those decisions had been moved and had been rejected by the Tribunal. It would appear from a statement made by learned counsel for the Revenue before the Tribunal that in respect of these questions an application under s. 256(2) had been moved but counsel for the Revenue cannot tell us what happened thereafter. And the assessee has filed an affidavit to state that it has no information in this behalf.
3.  Having regard to the fact that, under these circumstances, the earlier decisions of the Tribunal on the same question remain unchallenged, these appeals and the Special Leave Petitions are dismissed with costs.
Appeals disposed of.
