Tarun Kumar Gupta v Parwati Devi
Supreme Court of India

8 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.21295/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
We are not inclined to interfere with the matter.
1.  The Special Leave Petition is dismissed. After we dismissed the matter, learned counsel for the petitioner stated that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises immediately, it shall create great hardship to him. Therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is justified.
2.  We, therefore, grant time till 30.6.2001 to the petitioner to vacate the premises on his filing usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from today.
Petition dismissed.
