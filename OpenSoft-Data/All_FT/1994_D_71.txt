Dr. (Mrs.) Satyawati Goel v Director, State Lotteries, Government of Sikkim and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 January 1994
C.A. No. 7164 of 1993,
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appellant wanted to purchase a lottery ticket of the Government of Sikkim and for that purpose she sent a demand draft representing the value of the said ticket. The grievance of the appellant is that the respondents did not furnish the ticket to her and instead returned the demand draft after considerable delay of time. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi dismissed the complaint on the short ground that the complainant was not a "consumer" entitled to seek any relief under the Consumer Protection Act.
2. We see no ground to interfere with the impugned order of the National Commission.
The appeal is dismissed in limine. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
