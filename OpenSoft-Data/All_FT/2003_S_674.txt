Parvinder Singh v State of Punjab
Supreme Court of India

24 November 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Cr.) No. 3401/2003
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  In Criminal Appeal No.57-DB of 2001 an application for grant of bail was filed by the appellant being Criminal Miscellaneous No. 53713 of 2002. The bail application has not been examined on merits and has been dismissed holding that it is not maintainable, as against an earlier order of the High Court rejecting bail, a special leave petition was filed before this Court which was dismissed as withdrawn. The second ground stated in the impugned order is that the bail application has been rejected on three earlier occasions.
The fact that earlier bail application was rejected and the special leave petition was dismissed as withdrawn would not make the fresh bail application legally not maintainable. The High Court can always consider fresh circumstances and subsequent events.
2. The same would be the position regarding the earlier rejections. In this view, we are unable to sustain the impugned order dated 7th January, 2003. The bail application (Criminal Miscellaneous No.53713 pf 2002) shall be decided afresh on merits. We request the High Court to decide the application before the close of the court for winter vacation.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
