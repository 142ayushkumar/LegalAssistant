Commissioner of Income Tax v Western India Oil Distributing Company Limited
Supreme Court of India

23 April 1997
C.As. Nos. 2972 to 2975 of 1981 (Appeals from the judgment and order Dt. 3 4 July 1978, of the Bombay High Court in I.T.R. No. 37 of 1969).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard Shri J. Ramamurthy, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants in support of the appeal. We have also perused the impugned judgment of the High Court.
In the impugned judgment the High Court has held that if the quantification of loss is properly made and duly notified by following the prescribed procedure, such quantification may be impressed with the principle of finality if the matter is not carried further but the principle of finality as may be applicable to the question of quantification of the amount of loss does not apply to the determination of the source of income and to a decision whether the loss can or cannot be allowed to be carried forward by reason of the determination of the source.
2. This view of the High Court is based on the judgment of this court in CIT v. Manmohan Das 1965 Indlaw SC 225. In our opinion, there is no infirmity in the impugned judgment of the High Court. The appeals are, therefore, dismissed. No orders as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
