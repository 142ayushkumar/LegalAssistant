Chairman-Cum-Md, Messrs Central Coalfield Limited v Jogendra Singh (Dead) and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2003
C.A. No.6615 Of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Application for substitution is allowed.
1.  The dispute as to date of birth of the respondent-workman (deceased) led to his filing a Suit for declaration claiming that his actual date of birth was Ist October, 1935 and not Ist October, 1925, as recorded in the service record by the employer. Besides declaration as to date of birth in the Suit, further relief of reinstatement and back wages was also claimed. The trial court granted both the reliefs.
2. In the High Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the relief of reinstatement and back wages could be claimed only before the Labour court/Industrial Court under the Industrial Disputes Act and the Civil Court had no jurisdiction to grant that relief. The jurisdiction of the Civil Court to grant declaration as to date of birth was not, however, disputed.
3.  The High Court, by the impugned judgment, rejecting the contention as to jurisdiction, dismissed the appeal.
The question as to whether the Civil Court has jurisdiction to grant reinstatement and back wages, on the facts of the present case, is only academic. We, thus, decline to go into that academic question and leave it open.
4. In this view, the appeal is dismissed leaving the parties to bear their own costs. The decretal amount, if no paid, shall be paid within a period of 8 weeks.
Appeal dismissed.
