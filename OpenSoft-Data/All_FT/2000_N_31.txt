Nandi Verdhan Jain v Chander Kanta Jain and Another
Supreme Court of India

1 August 2000
Review Petition (C) No. 663 of 2000 In S.L.P. (C) No. 5959 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
The delay of 394 days is not satisfactorily explained.
1.  The only ground tried to be made out in the application for condonation of delay is that the petitioner was not able to understand as to what to do and had been taking advice from various persons. It has to be kept in view that when the special leave petition was dismissed on merits on 5-4-1999 by us, the petitioner's Advocate Mr. Chandra Prakash Pandey was heard. It is, therefore, obvious that the learned advocate was available to him to advise him as to what to do. Even that apart, we have gone through the merits of the review petition.
We do not find any error, much less any patent error, in the order sought to be got reviewed. All the courts below have concurrently held that the will relied upon by him is not legally proved.
2.  The High Court in second appeal, therefore, has refused to interfere, obviously because there was no substantial question of law for invoking the High Court's jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. That order got confirmed by summary rejection of the special leave petition. It discloses no error, much less any patent error, of law.
3.  The review petition is, therefore, dismissed both on the ground of not satisfactorily explained gross delay of 394 days as well as on merits.
Review dismissed.
