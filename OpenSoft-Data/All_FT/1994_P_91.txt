Manohar Lal Mulwani v Punjab State Corporation Bank Limited
Supreme Court of India

8 February 1994
C.A. No. 3030 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having heard learned counsel for the appellant - Mr G.L. Sanghi and learned counsel for the respondent - Mr Arvind Kumar, we are of the view that both the appellate court and High Court had gone wrong in coming to the conclusion that installation of an exhaust fan in a canteen would amount to nuisance. Law cannot be reduced to this pedantic level.
Therefore, the impugned judgments are set aside. The eviction petition will stand dismissed. The appeal is allowed.
However, we may add inasmuch as Mr Sanghi, learned counsel for the appellant, states that the exhaust fan "which is a source of nuisance" has already been removed. Even otherwise, the appellant undertakes to remove the same within a week from today. We record this undertaking.
Appeal allowed.
