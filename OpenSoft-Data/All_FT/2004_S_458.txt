State of Andhra Pradesh v B. Satya Rao
Supreme Court of India

13 October 2004
Crl.A.No. 1002 OF 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1. Criminal revision, bearing No. 496 of 1994 was disposed of by the impugned judgment of a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. To say the least, the judgment is non-speaking and non-reasoned. It would suffice to note that much alone for disposal of the appeal, as we think, it would be appropriate for the High Court to rehear the revision. Therefore, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, we remit the matter to the High Court for a fresh hearing.
The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.
