State of Uttar Pradesh v Bhupat and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 July 1984
C.A. No. 2000 of 1971.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal arises from a judgment rendered by learned Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court in Writ Petition 1947 of 1968. In the writ petition, constitutional validity of U.P. Public Land (Eviction and Recovery of Rent and Damages) Act XIII of 1959 (U.P. Act for short) was questioned. The learned Judge following the decision of the full Bench of the same High Court in Raja Ram Verma v. State of U.P.  held that the provisions of the impugned Act were violative of Art. 14 because it denied equality before law and was thus ultra vires the Constitution. Against the judgment of the High Court the State of U.P. has preferred this appeal by certificate.
2.  Much water has flown across the Yamuna since the decisions of the Allahabad High Court. In Maganlal Chhaganlal (P) Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of grater Bombay 1974 Indlaw SC 2701974 Indlaw SC 2701974 Indlaw SC 270 Constitution Bench of seven Judge of this Court upheld the validity of various provisions of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 which provided a different and a summary procedure for eviction from municipal premises. The impugned statue provided a different procedure and forum for recovering procession of the premises governed by it and the reasons which weighed with the Constitution Bench for upholding the validity of identical provisions of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act would apply mutatis mutandis to the present case with the result that the judgment of the High Court cannot stand. Further in Jai Dutt v. State of U.P. 1978 Indlaw SC 1021978 Indlaw SC 1021978 Indlaw SC 102 constitutional validity of the U.P. Act was questioned. After referring to the decision in Maganlal Chhaganlal case 1978 Indlaw SC 1021978 Indlaw SC 1021978 Indlaw SC 102 it was observed that the contention that the provisions of the provisions of the impugned Act were violative of Art. 14 no more survives an is concluded by the aforementioned decision. There was no alternative ground of attack.
3.   Therefore, in view of the above mentioned two decisions the challenge against the constitutionality of the impugned state cannot be upheld and consequently the decision of the High Court has to be reversed. Accordingly this appeal is allowed and the judgment of the High Court is set aside and the writ petition of the respondent is dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
