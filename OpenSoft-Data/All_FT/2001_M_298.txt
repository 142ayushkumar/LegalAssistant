Devidas Rama Chari v Messrs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17797/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petition stated that the matter might be disposed of at the S.L.P. stage by an order setting aside the order under challenge and restoring the writ petition to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits.
2. The High Court, by the order under challenge, summarily dismissed a writ petition filed by the present appellant. It said that another writ petition dealing with the same subject matter had been dismissed as withdrawn and
"considering that, prima facie we are not inclined to admit the present petition".
3.  That another writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn is no reason why the present writ petition was not considered on its own merits. Therefore, without expressing any opinion on the merits, we set aside the order under challenge and restore the writ petition (No.112 of 2000) to the file of the High Court to be considered at the admission stage.
Order accordingly.
