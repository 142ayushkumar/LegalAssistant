Leave granted.
1. Respondent admittedly had purchased cashew nut estate on April 16, 1969. The State Government of Kerala introduced the Land Reforms Bill, 1963 on April 1, 1964. One of the clauses relates to taking away exemption of cashew nut estate or its conversion from the purview of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 [for short, 'the Act']. The Bill was made Act 35of 1969 with effect from January 1, 1970. S. 82(4) of the Act declares that where after the commencement of theAct, any class of land specified in Schedule II has been convertedinto any other class of landspecified in that Schedule or intoa plantation, the extent ofland liable to surrendered by a person owning orholding such land shall be determined without taking into consideration such conversion. S. 84 (1) reads thus :
"84. Certain voluntary transfersto be null and void. - (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, all voluntary transfers effected afterthe date of publication of the Kerala Land Reforms Bill, 1963, in the Gazette, otherwise than -
(i) by way of partition; or x x x x x
(iii) in favour of a person who was a tenant of the holding before the 27th July, 1960, and continued to be so till the date of transfer; x xx x x by a family or any member thereof or by an adultunmarried person owning or holding land in excess of the ceiling area or otherwise than by way of gift in favour of his son or daughter or the son or daughter of his pre-deceased son or daughter by any person owning or holding land in excess of the ceiling area shall be deemedto be transfers calculated to defeat the provisions ofthis Act and shall be invalid. " (Emphasis supplied )
2. The voluntary sale is not one of the exempted transfers mentioned in S. 84(1). On the other hand, all voluntary transfers other than those excepted, should be deemed to be transfers calculated to defeat the provisions of the Act and should be invalid. The question, therefore, is whether the land purchasedby the respondent was intended to defeat the purposes of the Act and is invalid.
3. This Court P.J. Thomas vs. Taluk Land Board and Others. [(1993 ) Supp. (1) SCC 300 1992 Indlaw SC 622 ] considered the question of transfer and conversion underS. 82(4) and held that the conversionof cashew estate also will not be saved and it will come squarelywithin the mischief of S. 84(1) of Act. This is what the Court held :
"The transfer falling under S. 84 cannot be equated to the conversion falling under S. 82(4). The ceiling provisions contained in Ss. 82 and 83 came into force on January 1, 1970. The computation of the ceiling area has to be made in accordance with the provisions containedu/s. 82 as it stood on January 1, 1970. Under S. 82(4) where any class of land specifiedin Schedule II has been converted into a plantation after the commencement of the Act, the extent of the land liable to be surrendered by a person owning or holding such land hasto be determined without taking into consideration such conversion. Cashew estate is aland specified in Schedule II as on April 1, 1964 as well as on January 1, 1970. Therefor, the conversion of cashew estate after April 1, 1964and before January 1, 1970into plantation would squarely come under the mischief of this sub-section" .
4. The factsof this case stand on a higher footing than the facts therein. In this case, s. 84(1) specifically declares such voluntary transfers to be invalid. In other words, such transfers are void and of no effect. Admittedly, the transfer was effected within the prohibited period namely between April 1, 1964 and January 1, 1970. Therefore, the sale is a void sale. Thereby the respondents cannot save the cashew land purchased under the void sale from the purview of the Act.
5. Mr. Balakrishnan,learned counsel for the respondent, then sought to rely on S. 85 (1) explanation (a) and contended thatthe respondent having purchased the land was transferee under the transfer and, therefore, his rights in the land were not affected but the extent of land purchased can becalculated forfixing the extent ofland to be surrendered and the company should be directed to surrender excess land excluding the land underthe sale. We fail to appreciate thecontention. The purpose of S. 85(1), clause (a) to the Explanation seems to be that such of the transfers effected within the prohibited period and saved by sub-s. (1) of S. 84 were treated to be valid transfers and tothat extent they cannot have any effect while directing surrender of the excess land. But voluntary transfers which are void, cannot be saved in computing the excess land under S. 85 of the Act. Therefore, the High Court was clearly in error in its judgment dated June 27, 1989 in C.R.P. No. 879/89 that the lands get exempted by clause (a) to the Explanation to S. 85 (1) of the Act.
6. Mr. Balakrishnan also seeks to place reliance on State of Kerala vs. Philomina etc. etc. & Ors., [(1977 ) 1 SCR 273 1976 Indlaw SC 319 ]. The ratio therein was also considered and explained by this Court in P.J. Thomas's case 1992 Indlaw SC 622 (supra). We respectfully agree with the reasoning in Thomas case.
The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.
