Mohd. Hamid v Prescribed Authority and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 November 2001
C.A. No.6361/1999
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question involved in this appeal is whether the Muslim Banjara belongs to backward class and falls within Schedule I of the U.P. Public Services (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994. We feel that the views of the State Government are relevant on this question.
2.  Since the State Government is not a party to this appeal, let notice go to the State of U.P. to file an affidavit to that effect.
Notice shall be returnable within eight weeks.
Order accordingly.
