State of Maharashtra v Manubhai Pragaji Vashi and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 October 1991
S.L.P. (Civil) Nos. 14017-18 of 1988 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 19 August 1988 of the High Court of Bombay in W.P. Nos. 2303 and 4816 of 1987)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The respondents have furnished budget estimates for the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 showing that the State Government had allocated some amount for Law Colleges. Learned counsel for the petitioner/State wants time to seek further instructions from the State in this regard. He prays for one month's adjournment.
The prayer for adjournment is contested from the side of the respondents. We consider it proper in the interest of justice to grant a last opportunity of one month to the petitioner to file an affidavit stating all the details with regard to the allocation of budget for the Law Colleges in the State of Maharashtra.
2.   We also award a cost of Rs. 1000 for adjournment. Put up on November 22, 1991 at the top of the hearing cases subject to overnight part heard. The amount of Rs. 1000 will be paid within two weeks to the respondents.
Order accordingly.
