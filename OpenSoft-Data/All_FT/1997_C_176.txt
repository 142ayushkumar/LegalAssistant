Gokulchand Rattan Chand v Collector of Central Excise
Supreme Court of India

3 April 1997
C.A. No. 386 of 1987, Dt. 3 April 1997. Order We have read the order of the Tribunal. We have also seen the Notification No. 26/75
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Dated 1-3-1975. It has sought to be argued that logically textured yarn spun of synthetic staple fibres will be automatically exempted. We are of the view that the notification is confined only to Item No. 18(i) of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 (1 of 1944).
2. We are also of the view that since Item No. 18 (ii) was not specifically mentioned in the notification, the intention of the Government was to exclude Item No. 18(ii) out of the ambit of the notification. In the view of the matter, the appeal fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
