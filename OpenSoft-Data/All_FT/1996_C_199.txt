Gurukar Plastics Limited v Collector of Customs
Supreme Court of India

18 December 1996
C.A. No. 3804 of 1990
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal came to the conclusion that the contract upon which the appellants relied was not a firm contract. The Members wrote separate but concurring judgments.
The judgment of the Member (Technical) sets out the reasons in detail for holding that alterations in that contract were made from time to time in respect of price, period of shipment and the last date for opening the Letter of credit and that, therefore, the contract was not a firm contract.
2.  Having examined the material referred to, we are satisfied that the view taken by the Tribunal is unassailable.
The appeal is dismissed, with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
