Rajbinder Singh v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 December 1987
W.P. (Civil) No. 609 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner is an ad hoc lecturer. He was appointed for a term. His grievance is that he is likely to be removed from service so that he may be deprived of his vacation salary. It appears that the practice of the respondents is to appoint fresh people every time.
2.  This Court in a number of writ petitions (W.P. Nos. 125 of 1987 and 317 of 1987) has allowed the ad hoc teachers to continue in service until persons regularly selected by the PSC are appointed to the posts. The respondents ought to extend the benefit of that order to all other ad hoc lecturers. It is not proper to drive them to this Court for securing similar relief. We make it clear that the petitioner and other similar ad hoc teachers are entitled to the benefit of the order of this Court made in the aforesaid writ petitions.
3.  These observations in our opinion, are sufficient to safeguard the interest of the petitioner.
The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
