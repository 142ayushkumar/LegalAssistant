State of Rajasthan and others v Om Prakash Dadhich and another
Supreme Court of India

21 July 2003
C.As. No. 5142 of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 22811 of 2002) with Nos. 5143 and 5148 of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 22816 and 22819 of 2002)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard the learned counsel appearing on either side.
1.  The orders under challenge passed by the High Court at the preliminary stage itself leaving the main writ petitions to be pending in the High Court, in our view, tantamount to actually granting the relief sought for in the main writ petition itself, even at this stage of the proceedings. Keeping in view this aspect of the matter only, while ordering notice in the special leave petitions, interim stay was also granted.
2. We are of the view that the High Court should not have given such direction at the threshold of the proceedings itself and the relief of the nature which if at all could have been given only at the time of final hearing and disposal of the writ petitions, if sufficient case has been made out by the writ petitioners before the High Court. On this only ground the orders under challenge are set aside. The High Court will do well to have the main writ petitions viz. DBs (C) WPs Nos. 1731, 1732 and 1651 of 2002 themselves disposed of expeditiously, at least not later than six months. Till then the status quo brought about by the interim orders granted by this Court shall continue.
The appeals are accordingly finally disposed of. No costs.
Appeals disposed of.
