Babulal Agrawal v Damyanti Devi and Anr
Supreme Court of India

12 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12824/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard learned counsel and read the relevant papers. We are of the view that the civil revision application ought not to have been dismissed summarily by the High Court, for there are issues raised therein that need to be considered. We do not say any more because we do not wish to prejudice the case on either side.
2.  Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The civil revision application (C.R.No.1778 of 1999) is restored to the file of the High Court at Patna to be heard and disposed of afresh, on merits.
This shall be done expeditiously.
3.  Pending the disposal of the civil revision application, the status quo as of 28th August, 2000 shall be maintained.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
