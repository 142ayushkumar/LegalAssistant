Thermax Capital Limited v Vinit Kumar
Supreme Court of India

2 September 2002
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13921/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
LR Leave granted.
1.  On a summary suit filed by the plaintiff/appellant for recovery of Rs.6,15,713/-, an application was filed by the defendant/respondent seeking leave to defend the suit. The trial court, inter alia, noticing that the execution of the agreement was not disputed and also that 'the defendant has expressly agreed by the affidavit of even date his liability in personal capacity ', came to the conclusion that the defence raised by the defendant appeared to be illusory, sham and practically moonshine.
2. However, a conditional order was passed affording an opportunity to the defendant to contest the suit on the condition of his depositing principal amount of Rs.5,50,250/- in court. The aforesaid order was set aside in exercise of revisional jurisdiction by the impugned order passed by the High Court and unconditional leave was granted.
3.  Since the suit is pending, we refrain from expressing any opinion on the merit of the case lest it may prejudice any of parties. We may only note that the execution of the agreement, which is the basis of the suit, has not been disputed by the defendant. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the opinion that the High Court in an erroneous exercise of revisional jurisdiction has set aside a well reasoned order of the trial court granting conditional leave to the defendant.
4. In this view, we set aside the impugned order and restore the order of the trial court. The defendant is, however, granted six weeks further time to deposit the amount in terms of the order of the trial court.
The appeal is allowed in above terms. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
