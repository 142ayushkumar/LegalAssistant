Viatra A. G v State Trading Corporation of India Limited
Supreme Court of India

17 July 2002
Arbitration Petition No. 4 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In view of a factual error in the order made by me on 1-5-2002, I recall the same and make the following order after hearing the parties:
"I have been nominated by the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India to appoint a presiding arbitrator to decide the dispute between Viatra A.G. and State Trading Corporation of India Ltd."
2.  Exercising the authority so vested in me and after hearing the parties concerned, I appoint Mr. Justice S. Ranganathan, resident of A-102, Anandlok Coop. Group Housing Society, "Purvasha", Mayur Vihar, Phase I, Delhi 110 091, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court of India as the presiding arbitrator to decide the said dispute between the parties.
3.  The said presiding arbitrator will be paid such fee as may be determined by him.
4.  Learned counsel appearing for the State Trading Corporation has put forward a contention that there is no valid arbitral clause in the agreement. This is not a matter for me to decide. The objection, if any, in this regard will have to be raised before the learned arbitrators.
Ordered accordingly.
