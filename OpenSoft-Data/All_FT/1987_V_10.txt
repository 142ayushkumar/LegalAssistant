Ved Pal Varshney v Smt. Sheel Wanti
Supreme Court of India

8 January 1987
C.A. No. 1492 of 1976
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal by special leave is directed against the decision of the High Court affirming those recorded by the forums below. The short question raised in the matter is whether there was service of the notice of demand under Section 20(2)(a) of the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act . The question is one of pure fact and all the courts have taken the view against the appellant.
2.  Shortly before special leave was granted, the landlord appears to have taken over possession of the premises and the appellant-tenant is no more in possession. In such circumstances the only proper course is to dismiss the appeal.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
