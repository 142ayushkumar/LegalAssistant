Commnr of Income Tax, Patiala v Messrs Subhash Chand and Company
Supreme Court of India

23 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6377/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The notice that was issued on the special leave petition stated that the matter appeared to be covered by the decisions of this Court in Bihari Lal Jaiswal vs. C.I.T. 1995 Indlaw SC 646 and Motilal Chunnilal (Tak) vs. C.I.T. 1997 Indlaw SC 1670.
2.  We have heard learned counsel. We are of the view that the issue is squarely covered in favour of the Revenue by these two decisions. Therefore, the civil appeal is allowed, the order under appeal is set aside and the question is answered in the negative and in favour of the Revenue.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
