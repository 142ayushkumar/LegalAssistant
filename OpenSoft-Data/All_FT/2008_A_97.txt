Sheena P. S. v Ajith Kumar V. S.
Supreme Court of India

17 July 2008
TRANSFER PETITION (CIVIL) NO.1040 OF 2006
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This is an application for transfer which was listed before this Court on 1st December, 2006, when the following order was passed:
"Issue notice. Until further orders, further proceeding before the trial court shall remain stayed."
2.  When the matter was listed before the Ld. Registrar (Judl.) on 12th November, 2007, the petitioner sought three weeks' time to file application for withdrawal. Now by a letter, Petitioner has prayed to vacate the stay order and permission to withdraw the original transfer petition. That being the position, the transfer petition is treated dismissed as withdrawn and the stay order granted earlier by this Court stands vacated.
