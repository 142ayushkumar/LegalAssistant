Kanta Vaid and Others v State and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 December 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Cr.) No. 1873/2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted in both the matters.
1.  Both these matters raise a common question and impugn a common order passed by the High Court, hence they have been heard together and they are being disposed of by this common order.
2.  It appears that some criminal proceedings were initiated against the petitioners. They moved application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. before the High Court for quashing of the criminal case. However, the High Court took the view that the petition was premature since it would be open for the petitioners to raise any objection or point, they would like to raise at the time of framing of the charges and in case the order goes against them, they will still have remedy against such an order.
3.  We feel that the view taken by the High Court is erroneous. The petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. could not be thrown away barely on the above noted ground.
4. In this view of the matter, we allow the appeals, set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court and send back the case, namely, the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to the High Court for consideration on merits.
Appeals allowed.
