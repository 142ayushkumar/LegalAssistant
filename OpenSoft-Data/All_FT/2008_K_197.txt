Kokku Sudhakar v State of Andhra Pradesh, Represented By Its Public Prosecutor, High Court of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

14 October 2008
Criminal Appeal No. 1665 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2.  The sole appellant was convicted by the Trial court under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 [for short, "I.P.C."] and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay fine of Rupees ten thousand; in default, to undergo further simple imprisonment for a period of one year. He was further convicted under Section 309 I.P.C. and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year.
3.  The sentences were, however, ordered to run concurrently. On appeal being preferred, High Court confirmed the convictions. Hence, this appeal by special leave.
4.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties at length and perused the records, we are of the view that the Trial Court as well as the High Court convicted the appellant upon threadbare discussion of evidence and no interference by this Court is called for.
The criminal appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.
