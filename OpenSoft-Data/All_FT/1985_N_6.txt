Narendra Bahadur Singh and Others v Gorakhpur University and Another
Supreme Court of India

9 September 1985
Petn. For Spl. Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 5203 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Special leave petition is dismissed. But we would direct the College to give first preference to the petitioners if they seek admission to the B.Ed. Course during this academic year or the next academic year. The Gorakhpur University will also take care to ensure that no College affiliated to it shall give admissions to the Students more than the prescribed number, because the students who are admitted in excess of the prescribed number suffer in the process and it is the duty of the University to take care to see that the students are not duped by the Colleges. The University must take steps against the erring College with a view to protect the students. It is surprising that immediately after the admissions are over the University has not taken care to check whether any of the Colleges had admitted students in excess of the prescribed numbers. To wake up at the last moment and then to rely on the legal provision would cause great hardship to the students.
2. We hope and trust that the University will be more careful in future and try to ensure the welfare of the students, a task in which the University in the present case has failed.
Special leave petition dismissed.
Petition dismmised.
