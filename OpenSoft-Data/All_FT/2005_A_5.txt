The Order of the Court was as follows :
W.P.(C) No.116 of 1998
1. This petition, filed u/art. 32 of the Constitution of India in public interest, seeks implementation of various provisions of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The directions are sought against Union of India, various State Governments and other respondents. We accept the suggestion of Mr. Bhandare that instead of considering the position of all the States which may take considerable amount of time, initially, the existing position and state of affairs in six States and Union of India may be examined and the appropriate directions issued on hearing counsel representing the said States and Union of India besides learned counsel appearing for the petitioner.
The petitioner is granted two weeks' time to give the names of the States in respect of which the case may be taken up first. A brief synopsis in respect of each such State shall also be filed and copies given to counsel for the State Governments and Union of India. Response thereto may be filed within four weeks thereafter.
2. List thereafter.
3. Three months' time granted to the petitioner to place on record further material in terms of order dated 15th September 2004 is further extended by three months from today. I.A.No.5 in W.P.(C)No.116 of 1998
4. Learned counsel for the petitioner and National Institute of Visually Handicapped submit that after the orders were passed on 28th October 2003 in I.A.No.3, books in various subjects for visually impaired students have been made available.
In this view this application is disposed of with liberty to parties to move the Court again, if need arises. W.P.(C)No.115 of 1998; C.A.Nos.6442 & 6443 of 1998.
