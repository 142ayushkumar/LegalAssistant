31 March 1992
W.P. (C) No. 9982 of 1983
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The short question that arises for our consideration in this case is whether 'Raskat' which is an inferior quality of 'Gur' could be held to be an agricultural produce within the meaning of Section 2 (a) U. P. Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam, 1964.
2.   Having regard to the fact that it is nothing more than an inferior quality of 'Gum' applying Rethought Khandsari Udyog v. State of U. P. and Kishan Lal v. State of Rajasthan we hold it as an agricultural produce.
Accordingly, the writ petition stands dismissed. No order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.
