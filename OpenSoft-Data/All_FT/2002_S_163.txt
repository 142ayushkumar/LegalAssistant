Messrs Apollo Hospital, Andhra Pradesh and Others v Sivakanth Dixit and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 March 2002
S.L.P. (C)No. 17890 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The impugned order passed by National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi condones the delay in filing the complaint by the respondents exercising power under proviso to sub-Section (2) of Section 24-A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
2. The complaint is yet to be decided on merits. We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order at this stage, as the better course would be to give liberty to the petitioners to dispute the correctness of the order impugned herein in the event of the complaint being decided against the petitioners and an occasion arising for filing an appeal.
3.  It was pointed out that subsequent to the passing of the impugned order of the Commission, and during the pendency of this SLP, some affidavits on behalf of respondents have been received by the Commission by way of ex-parte evidence. In fairness to both the parties, we deem it proper to permit the petitioners an opportunity of participating in the hearing on merits.
4. If the petitioners move an application seeking cross-examination on affidavits filed by complainants, the same shall be allowed by the Commission and thereafter evidence/additional evidence permitted to be adduced by either party.
5.  We make it clear that any observation made or finding recorded in the impugned order by the Commission shall be deemed only for the purpose of condoning the delay and shall not prejudice any plea raised by either party at the hearing on merits of the complaint.
6.  Subject to the above said observations, the SLP be treated as disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
