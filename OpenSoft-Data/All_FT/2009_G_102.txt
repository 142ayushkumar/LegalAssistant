Shenthamizh Kizhar v Government Pleader, Madras
Supreme Court of India

30 April 2009
Criminal Appeal No. 1100 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The sole appellant was convicted by the High Court under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay fine of Rupees two thousand; in default to undergo further simple imprisonment for a period of two months. Hence, this appeal.
2.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant stated that in terms of the direction given by the High Court, the appellant has deposited the amount of fine. Learned counsel then submitted that as the appellant has already remained in jail for five months, the sentence of imprisonment awarded to him may be reduced to the period already undergone.
3.  Having taken into consideration all the pros and cons of the matter, we are of the view that ends of justice would be met in case the sentence of imprisonment awarded to the appellant is reduced to the period already undergone.
4.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in-part and while upholding the conviction of the appellant, sentence of imprisonment is reduced to the period already undergone. The appellant, who is on bail, is discharged from the liability of bail bonds.
Appeal allowed
