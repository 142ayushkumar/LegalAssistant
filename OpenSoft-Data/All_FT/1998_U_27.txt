P. Ashokan v Union Of India & Anr
Supreme Court of India

6 February 1998
Writ Petition (c) No. of 1997 Dairy No. 20068 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On merits, we find no case to entertain this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. Besides a three Judge Bench decision of this Court, authored by J.S. Verma, J. (as Hon'ble the Ex-Chief Justice then was) in Khoday Distilleries Limited and Anr. vs. The Page 144 has ruled as follows:
"In a case like the present, where in substance the challenge is to the correctness of a decision on merits after it has become final, there can be no question of invoking Article 32 of the Constitution to claim reconsideration of the decision on the basis of its effect in accordance with law. such situations is wholly misconceived and impels us to emphasis this fact."
We are in agreement with such view.
The writ petition is dismissed.
