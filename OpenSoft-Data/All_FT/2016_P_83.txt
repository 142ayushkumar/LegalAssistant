1. Leave granted.
2. As far as the fixation of land valuation to the tune of Rs.1,72,000/- per acre is concerned, the same has attained finality, as rightly pointed out by the learned Counsel for the State. But there is no mention in the judgment for the entitlement of statutory benefits. Therefore, this appeal is allowed to the extent of declaration that the appellants shall also be entitled to all the statutory benefits on the land valuation of Rs.1,72,000/- per acre.
Appeal allowed
