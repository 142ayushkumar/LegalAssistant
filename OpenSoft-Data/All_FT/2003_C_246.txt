Commissioner of Income Tax, Gwalior v Nabhinandan Digamber Jain and another
Supreme Court of India

28 January 2003
C.A. Nos. 838-840 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals impugn the correctness of two judgments of the High Court, one dismissing an application under Section 256(2) of the Income Tax Act 
 for referring a question of law pertaining to the assessment year 1988-1989 and the other, dismissing an appeal under Sec. 260-A of the Income Tax Act pertaining to the Assessment year 1990-91.
2.  By an application under Sec. 256(2) of the Act the Revenue sought a direction to the Tribunal for reference of the following question of law:
"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the ITAT is justified in holding that the agricultural income will not form a part of total income for the purpose of computing the accumulation of income in excess of 25% of the total income as laid down U/s. 11 of the I.T. Act 1961"
3.  The main reason why Revenue sought this question of law to be referred for the opinion of the High Court was because there was a conflict of views on this question between the view expressed by the Allahabad High Court in Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Panchati Akharas Nirmal 1991 Indlaw ALL 166 and the view expressed by the Madras High Court in Silasri Kasivasi Muthukumaraswami Thambiran vs. Agrl. ITO 1977 Indlaw MAD 208.
4.  The High Court, in the first impugned judgment, instead of deciding whether a question of law was required to be referred, disposed of the application under Sec. 256(2) by expressing its opinion that Sec. 10(1) of the Act excludes agricultural income and in that view of the matter the reference sought for was uncalled for. Having done so, the appeal under Sec. 260-A on the substantial question of law pertaining to the next assessment year was also dismissed on the ground that Revenue's application under Section 256(2) had been rejected previously.
5. In our view, the High Court erred on both counts. The fact that the question raised was a substantial question of law is incontrovertible. Instead of attempting to answer it while dealing with the application under Sec. 256(2), the High Court should have granted the application and directed to refer the question of law. Without a decision on deciding the substantial question of law, the Revenue's appeal under Sec. 260-A on a substantial question of law could not have been dismissed.
6.  For the aforesaid reasons, we set aside both the judgments. The Tribunal is directed to draw up a statement of case and refer the question of law as mentioned above pertaining to the assessment year 1988-89 for the opinion of the High Court. Tax Appeal No. 15 of 2000 is restored to the file of the High Court, and admitted for hearing and disposal in accordance with law.
7.  The appeals are accordingly disposed of with no orders as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
