1.  This appeal by M/s Karanpura Development Company Ltd. arises out of and is directed against the judgment and order dated April 18, 1970 of the Patna High Court in Misc. Appeal No. 374 of 1966 dismissing the appellant's claim for compensation under certain heads of Section 13 of the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957.
2.  The Tribunal to which the question of quantification was referred under Section 14(2) of that Act determined a certain amount as compensation after disallowing claims pertaining to litigation expenses of Rs 819 (item VIII of the claim) ; solatium of Rs 2454-13 (item X of the claim) and for interest under item 16.
Appellant company aggrieved by the disallowance made by the tribunal went up in appeal to the High Court which dismissed it. Appellant has come up in appeal by certificate.
3.  Having regard to the extent of pecuniary considerations in this appeal, which are obviously small, we dismiss the appeal without a pronouncement on the merits of the contentions raised. The contentions will be considered in the other appeals, viz., C.A. Nos. 741 and 743 of 1973 which will be dealt with separately. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
