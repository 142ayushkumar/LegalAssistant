They read thus :
"2. The three appeals before the Tribunal related to the Income-tax assessments of M/s. M. H. Harton & Co. Ltd. Calcutta (hereinafter referred to as "the assessee") for the assessment years 1959 and 1960) arose in the following circumstances.
3. (a) On 12-5-59, the Income tax Officer served on the assessee a notice under section 18-A(1) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter referred to as "the 1922 Act") to pay during the financial year 1959- 60 and on the dates specified, a sum of Rs. 1, 60, 174/- by way of advance tax in relation to the assessment year 1960-61. On 16.6.59, the assessee filed an estimate under section 18A(2) showing an estimated income of Rs. 1 lakh. On 16-3-60, the assessee filed a revised estimate showing an Income of Rs. 1, 80, 000/- on which advance tax was payable and paid a tax of Rs. 81, 000/-. Thereafter, the regular return u/s. 22 for the assessment year 1960-61 was filed on 20-2-1961 declaring a total income of Rs. 2, 20, 352/-.
(b) For the assessment year 1961-62, there was a like notice under sec. 18A(1) demanding an advance tax of Rs. 1, 60, 174/-. On 15-6-1960 assessee filed an estimate showing nil income and paid no advance tax. A revised estimate was filed on 21-3-61 showing an income of Rs. 80, 000/- but this was much beyond the date within which the assessee could file such a revised estimate under section 18A(2).
(c) For the assessment year 1961-62, a notice u/s. 22(2) of the 1922 Act was served on the assessee on 25-5-1961, calling for a return of income by 13-6-1961. The return, however, was actually filed only on 2-12-1961.
4. On 13-6-1961, Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act XLIII of 1961) (hereinafter referred to as the 1961 Act) received the assent of the President. U/s. 1(3), this Act came into force, say as otherwise provided therein, on the 1st April, 1962. By s. 297(1) of the Act, the 1922 Act was repealed, subject to the savings contained in sub-s. (2) of that section."
3.  Both the questions referred for the decision of this court are now covered by the decisions of this court. So far as the first question is concerned by the decision of this court in Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi (Central) vs. Singh Engineering Works (P) Ltd. So far as the second question is concerned, it is covered by the decision of this court in Jain Brothers & others vs. Union of India.
4.  In view of these decisions, we answer both these questions in favour of the Department. The respondent is ex parte and on our request Mr. S. Mitra was good enough to assist us in the case. We are thankful to him for the assistance he gave to us.
5.  In the circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs.
Reference answered in favour of Revenue.
