Gulshan Schdeva and Another v Messrs Sundial Communications Private Limited and
Supreme Court of India

14 November 2003
Special Leave Petition (Civil) 5608-5609 of 2003 with S.L.P. (C) Nos. 5611-5612/2003
The Judgment was delivered by : Rajendra Babu, J.
1.  These matters arise out of an interim order passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court and the Division Bench, on appeal, having dismissed the appeals.
2.  Elaborate arguments have been addressed by the learned counsel on either side.It is unnecessary to examine the various questions raised in these petitions as these cases arise out of an interlocutory order. The High Court has adequately taken care for quick disposal of the original matter.
3. Therefore, we decline to interfere with the order made by the High Court.
These petitions, therefore, stand dismissed. No costs.
Petitions dismissed
