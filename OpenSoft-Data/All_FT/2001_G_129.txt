Central Coalfields Limited and Anr v Govind Kumar Sharma and Others
Supreme Court of India

4  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14781/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The Central Coalfields Ltd is in appeal against the impugned judgment and order dated 29.6.2000 passed by Division Bench of the Patna High Court at Ranchi directing the petitioner to reconsider the case of the respondents for the post of Radiographer. The respondent had not been appointed on the ground that the diploma which the respondent had, was not from a Government recognized institute.
2. The High Court, by the impugned order, has directed the petitioners to reconsider the case of the respondents because persons with similar qualification have been retained.
3.  The Coalfields Ltd in its rejoinder affidavit, has stated that appointments have been made on the basis of diploma in Radiography from an unrecognised institute, when it was not aware that the institute is not recognised. After having come to know that the diploma in question is not from a recognised institute, no further appointment has been made with that qualification.
4.  It is contended by Shri Anip Sachthey, learned counsel for the petitioner that the diploma in Radiography is merely a desirable qualification and not essential qualification. There is no other material for consideration in the case of the respondents for appointment.
5.  It is true that the diploma in question is a desirable qualification as indicated for the registration in the Employment Exchange for recruitment. But in a subject like this, the so-called desirable qualification is of great significance and, therefore, the order under challenge is difficult to be sustained. In that view of the matter we set aside the impugned order and allow this appeal.
Appeal allowed.
