Harvinder Singh v Messrs Punjab Communication Limited and Anr
Supreme Court of India

11 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11558/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court in these cases has refused to entertain the matter on the ground that the appellants should seek remedy under the Industrial law. There are other matters of similar nature still pending before the High Court. It is not open to the High Court to have dismissed the matters on that ground.
2. Therefore, we set aside the order made by the High Court and remit the matters for fresh consideration of this question along with the other connected matters. The appeals are allowed accordingly.
Appeals allowed.
