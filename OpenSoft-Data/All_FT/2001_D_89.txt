K. Digambar Singh v Delhi Development Authority and Anr
Supreme Court of India

17 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18530/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Appeal is partly allowed in the terms as stated in the signed order.
2.  In this matter the question raised is one relating to allotment of a flat by the respondent and the payments to be made in respect of the same. It appears that certain dispute having been arisen, the matter reached the High Court and the High court directed the respondent (Col. K. Digambar Singh - appellant before us) to pay a sum of Rs.8, 23, 000/- to the respondents (Delhi Development Authority) within a period of 30 days from August 9, 2000 and at the same time directed that the interest shallbe paid at different rates for different period as follows:
(1) w.e.f. 1.5.97 to 31.5.97 - 12% per annum.
(2) w.e.f 1.6.97 till date of payment- 18% per annum On an overall consideration of the matter, we think that it is not approprirate for the High Court ot have awarded any higher rate of interest from 1.6.1997.
3. The interest for the entire period should be at a flat rate of 12% per annum. Hence, in this respect the order made by the High Court is modified.
4.  In other respects the order made by the High Court is maintained. The appellant shall deposit the amount within three months from today. The appeal is partly allowed in the aforesaid terms.
Appeal partly allowed.
