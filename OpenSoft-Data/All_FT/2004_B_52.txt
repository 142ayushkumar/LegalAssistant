The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Counsel for the appellant as well as the respondent state that they have received instructions from their respective clients on telephone that the matter has been settled between the parties out of court and, therefore, the appeal has become infructuous.
2.  On the statement made by the counsel for the appellant, that the dispute has been settled between the parties outside the court, the appeal is dismissed as not pressed.
3.  Since the counsel for the appellant has not received any written instructions, we reserve liberty with the counsel for the appellant to apply for restoration of appeal in case he receives instructions to the contrary; the restoration application can be filed within a reasonable time which is fixed as six months.
The appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
