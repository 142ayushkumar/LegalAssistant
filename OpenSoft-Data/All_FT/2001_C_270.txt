Commissioner of Income Tax v Alpine Solvex Limited
Supreme Court of India

9  May  2001
C.A. No. 3769 of 2001 (Arising as an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 12 July 2000, of the Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) in I.T.A. No. 91 of 1999).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
Heard the learned Attorney General.
1.  In our opinion, a substantial question of law did arise in this case, which is as follows :
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law ,the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal was justified in holding that the liquidated damages received by the assessee on account of breach of contract are nothing but a part of profit received from the industrial undertaking on which the assessee is entitled for deduction under sections 80HH and 80-IA"?
2. The High Court, in our opinion, was wrong in dismissing the appeal in limine.
3.  We therefore allow this appeal, set aside the High Court's order and direct the High Court to hear the appeal on the merits.
Appeal allowed.
