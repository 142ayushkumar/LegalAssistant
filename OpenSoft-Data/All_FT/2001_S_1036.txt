State of Punjab and Others v Roshan Singh
Supreme Court of India

26 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19411/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court sets aside an order of termination on a finding that the order is punitive in nature. This conclusion is based upon the fact that the discharge order itself indicates that the delinquent did not obey the office. It is contended by the State, however, that this is an incorrect premise on which the High Court has proceeded inasmuch as the order dated 13.7.1994 which has been relied upon by the High Court, in fact, does not mention the aforesaid terms.
2.  In these circumstances, it would be appropriate for the State to move an application for review. The learned counsel, therefore, withdraws this petition.
It is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
