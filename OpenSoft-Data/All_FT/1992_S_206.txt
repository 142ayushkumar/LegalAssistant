State of Assam v Abdul Halim and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 April 1992
Cr.A. No. 74 of 1991
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is a criminal appeal arising out of an order passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Gauhati dismissing the reference made by the Sessions Judge u/s. 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The brief facts of the case which lead to this appeal are as follows.
2.  The Sessions Judge of Nawagaon, during the trial of a murder case in Sessions Case No. 18(N) of 1974 exercising the powers conferred u/s. 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure directed the five respondents herein to be tried together with four other original accused already committed by the Magistrate to take their trial u/s. 302 read with S. 34 IPC and also issued non-bailable warrants against these respondents.
3.  The respondents approached the High Court by filing a Criminal Revision Case No. 155 of 1978 challenging the order of the Sessions Judge passed u/s. 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned Single Judge of the High Court allowed the revision holding
"I am therefore of the opinion that S. 319(1), as it is worded has no application to Sessions trials so as to override S. 193 CrPC."
4.  The learned Single Judge thus quashed the order of the Sessions Judge impleading the respondents as accused and also the non-bailable warrants issued against them and directed the Sessions Judge to proceed against the original accused. After the matter went back, the Sessions Judge made a reference before the High Court u/s. 395 CrPC bringing to the notice of the High Court that the order of the learned Single Judge was contrary to the decision of the Supreme Court in Joginder Singh v. State of Punjab 1978 Indlaw SC 1051978 Indlaw SC 1051978 Indlaw SC 1051978 Indlaw SC 105.
5. The Division Bench though expressed its opinion that in view of the judgment rendered by this Court in Joginder Singh case  1978 Indlaw SC 1051978 Indlaw SC 1051978 Indlaw SC 1051978 Indlaw SC 105, the decision given by the learned Single Judge of that Court in the criminal revision is not good law, however rejected the reference holding that once the judgment has been pronounced by the High Court either in exercise of its appellate or revisional jurisdiction, no review or revision can be entertained against that judgment as there is no provision in the Code which would enable the High Court to review the same or to exercise the revisional jurisdiction. However, the High Court has granted leave to appeal before this Court u/art. 134(1)(c) of the Constitution of India.
6.  The principles of law underlying S. 319 of the Code is well settled by this Court and therefore, that question does not now arise for consideration before us. Though the Division Bench of the High Court has rejected the reference on the ground that it has no jurisdiction to quash the order of the learned Single Judge, we by invoking our inherent jurisdiction, quash that order of the learned Single Judge made in Criminal Revision Case No. 155 of 1978 dated December 12, 1978.
7.  The next question is whether these five respondents should be asked to face the trial at this length of time. The occurrence should have taken place before 1974 since the order of the Sessions Judge is dated September 23, 1974. In other words, it was 18 years ago this occurrence had happened.
8.  None of the counsel appearing for the parties before us, is in a position to inform this Court as to the stage or result of the Sessions case after the reference has been rejected by the Division Bench of the High Court. Be that as it may, though we have quashed the order of the learned Single Judge, we feel that the respondents at this length of time shall not be directed to face the trial of the Sessions case. The appeal is allowed subject to the direction note to proceed against the respondents as indicated above.
Appeal allowed.
