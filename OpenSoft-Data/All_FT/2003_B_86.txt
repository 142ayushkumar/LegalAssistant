Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi v Bhagsons Paint Industry (India)
Supreme Court of India

16 October 2003
C.A. No. 5774 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Tribunal in an appeal arising under the Central Excise Act held that the adjudication made after a lapse of nearly nine years after the issue of show cause notice is not permissible and set aside the same.
2.  There is no statutory bar to adjudicate the matter even after lapse of nine years after the issue of show cause notice and the adjudication pertains only to the actual levy of the duty which is due to the department and not to any levy of interest or penalty.
3. In these circumstances we think the view taken by the Tribunal is not justified and we set aside the order made by the Tribunal and remit the matter to the Tribunal for fresh disposal in accordance with law after restoration of the appeal to its original number. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
