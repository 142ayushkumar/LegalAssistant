1. Mr. P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel has brought to our notice the clerical/typographical error which has occurred in the judgment dated 14.5.2015 pronounced by the Constitution Bench in the WP(C)No. 1072/2013 authored by one of us (A.K.Sikri, J.). It is pointed out that in para 24 of the said judgment where this Court has held Section 409 (3)(a) and (c) are invalid, clause (c) has been wrongly typed instead of clause (e) of Section 409 (3). Submission of Mr Patwalia appears to be correct, as clause (c) was not even the subject matter of challenge. The correction is carried out accordingly.
Order accordingly
