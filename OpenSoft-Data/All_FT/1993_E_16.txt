Employees' State Insurance Corporation v Premier Clay Products
Supreme Court of India

25 August 1993
C.A. No. 3218 of 1989
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is no substance in this appeal filed by the Corporation. The respondent had hired some casual coolies for loading and unloading of its goods. The work itself was of a sporadic nature. The coolies were available for work to others and in fact on the very day worked for several others who engaged them.
2.   In the circumstances, the said coolies cannot even be called casual workmen. Hence no contribution is payable by the respondent to the Corporation on their behalf. The case of the appellant-Corporation was, therefore, rightly negatived by the courts below.
The appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
