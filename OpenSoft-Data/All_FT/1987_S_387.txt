Mahendra Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 February 1987
C.A. No. 464 of 1987 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 1952 of 1982)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Special leave granted.
2. We are satisfied that there were trees planted on the land measuring 0.72 acres which is the subject matter of this appeal before January 24, 1971 and there is no proof that they had been cut before that date. It is admitted that new plants had been planted on the land in question after January 24, 1971. The appellant's case was that the trees that were in existence prior to January 24, 1971 had been cut down after obtaining the permission from the Collector and the land had been replanted thereafter.
3. The High Court was, therefore, in error in the circumstances of this case in holding that the land had ceased to be a grove land. We declare that the land measuring 0.72 acres which is the subject matter of this appeal was a grove land on the relevant date and it shall be dealt with accordingly under the U.P. Imposition of Ceilings on Land Holdings Act. The prescribed authority shall now pass necessary consequential orders. The judgment of the High Court is set aside and the appeal is allowed. There will, however, be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
