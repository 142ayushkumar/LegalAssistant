Sham Jairamdas Bajaj v Assistant Commnr. of Police and Anr
Supreme Court of India

28 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3261/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Mr. V.S. Kotwal, learned senior counsel submitted that petitioners would be advised to highlight the points raised here in the trial court at the appropriate stage. Now he made a request that petitioners may be exempted from personal appearance in the trial court. It is for the petitioners to make an application/applications in the trial court for that purpose.
If the trial Judge finds that the trial proceedings can continue in spite of the exemption being granted to the petitioners we hope that the trial Judge would pass appropriate orders on that application/applications provided the petitioners would conform to the following conditions:
1. that they will not dispute their identity as the accused in the case;
2. that a counsel on their behalf will appear for them in the court when the case is taken up; and
3. they themselves will be present in the court when their presence is imperatively needed.
2. With these observations this Special Leave Petitions are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
