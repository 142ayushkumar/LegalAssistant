Rakesh Kumar Goel and others v Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation Limited and others
Supreme Court of India

24 April 2009
S.L.P. (C) No. 15873 of 2006
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Despite notice, the State of U.P. has remained absent. In this case serious allegations are made against the petitioner on the basis of the petitioner indulging in a land scam. An affidavit has been filed by the Deputy Manager, U.P. State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. giving credentials of the petitioner with regard to the fraud allegedly committed of more than rupees one thousand crores. Several cases are pending before the criminal courts under the Penal Code, 1860 as well as under the Gangster Act. Although the present case arises from an auction-sale, we want to know from the State of U.P. as to on what basis people with such credentials are allowed to take part in the auction and why is the State not responding to the petition.
2. In the circumstances, we are directing the Law Secretary to remain present in this Court on 14-7-2009. Matter to come up on 14-7-2009, first on board before this Court.
3.  In the meantime, we are directing the petitioner to file all his income tax returns of the last eight years in this Court in order to ascertain his financial capacity to make bids in various auction-sales which have taken place in the last couple of years in the State of U.P. We also want the petitioner to convey the particulars of the Commissioner under the Income Tax Act within whose jurisdiction his returns are being filed under the Income Tax Act. No interim order.
Order accordingly.
