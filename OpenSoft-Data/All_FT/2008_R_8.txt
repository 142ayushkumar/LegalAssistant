Commissioner of Income Tax v R. M. P. Plasto Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2008
C.A. No. 6438 of 2008
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated July 17,2006, of the Gujarat High Court in T. C. A. No. 1636 of 2005 and Tax Appeal No.1637 of 2005.
2. The judgment of the High Court (Y. R. Meena Actg. C. J. and D. A. Mehta J.) dated July 17, 2006, was as follows:
The following question is proposed for admission of these appeals :
'Whether the Appellate Tribunal is right in law and on facts in cancelling the penalty levied under section 271(1)(c) of the Act on the ground that there was loss assessed in the year under consideration, without appreciating the fact that there was positive income which was reduced to nil only after allowing set off of carried forward losses of earlier years?'
3.  At the outset, learned counsel for the appellant (CIT) fairly admits that earlier in Tax Appeal No. 167 of 2005 similar question was proposed for admission of the appeal and by order dated October 4, 2005, CIT v. Avon Flours P. Ltd. the appeal was dismissed.
4. Following the aforesaid decision on similar question as proposed in these appeals, we see no merit in these appeals.
Accordingly the appeals stand dismissed."
The Department preferred appeals to the Supreme Court.
Leave granted.
None appears for the respondent-assessee though served.
5.  In view of the judgment of the larger Bench in CIT v. Gold Coin Health Food P. Ltd. (Civil Appeal No. 5065 of 2008), decided on August 18, 2008, the appeal herein stands allowed in favour of the Department with no order as to costs.
