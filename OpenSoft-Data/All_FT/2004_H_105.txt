Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (Private) Limited and another v Santosh Mittal and another
Supreme Court of India

6 December 2004
S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 24266-68 of 2004 with S.L.P. (C) No. 24413 of 2004 with S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 24661-63 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr Harish N. Salve, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner in SLPs (C) Nos. 24266-68 of 2004 and Mr Arun Jaitley, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners in SLPs (C) Nos. 24413 and 24661-63 of 2004 state that the petitioners will be advised to approach the High Court to seek clarification of exactly what kind of disclosure the High Court requires them to make.
2.  We record the statement and dismiss the special leave petitions giving liberty to the petitioners to approach the High Court for that purpose. In case the petitioners feel aggrieved by the order passed by the High Court on the clarification application, the dismissal of these special leave petitions will not come in their way in challenging the said order.
3. We may, however, place on record that the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners intended to argue larger Constitutional issues touching Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution which have not been raised on a second thinking and we leave them open to be decided in some other appropriate case.
4.  Though the special leave petitions are dismissed, but the operation of the order dated 3-11-2004 passed by the High Court suspending the operation of its judgment for six weeks, is extended by another two weeks from today.
Petitions dismissed.
