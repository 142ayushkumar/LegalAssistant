K.Chandran v A. Karuppasamy
Supreme Court of India

23 January 2009
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.157 OF 2009 (Arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.8885 of 2008)
1. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. Leave granted.
3. The parties have filed a Compromise Settlement Deed stating therein that they have settled their dispute and the respondent has received the money in full from the appellant and the money due is fully settled towards full and final settlement of the cheque payment vide cheque No.993618 dated 07.05.2002. The respondent has further stated in the Compromise Settlement Deed that he will not proceed or take any action in the same cause of action. The parties have also agreed to compound the offence.
That being so, we feel that in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, it would be appropriate to set aside the impugned order and quash the proceedings, if any. We order accordingly. The appeal is accordingly disposed of in terms of the compromise settlement arrived at between the parties.
Appeal disposed of
