Secretary, Central Bd.Of Sec.Edu. and Others v Abinash Chandra and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.5147/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  According to us, these special leave petitions are uncalled for, for the only direction that the court has passed requires the petitioners.
"to consider communicating the marks secured by the candidates at the All India Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Entrace Examination from the next year to the failed candidates or, at least, to such candidates who are desirous of knowing their marks on payment of charges."
2. There was, therefore, nothing that required the petitioners to come here. In any event, it seems to us that any candidate who has appeared in an examination, whether he has passed or failed, is entitled to know what marks he has secured at that examination.
3.The special leave petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
