Commissioner of Income Tax v Sundaram Spinning Mills
Supreme Court of India

5 December 2000
C.A. No. 2498 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is an appeal by the Revenue against the judgment and order of the High Court at Madras 1996 Indlaw MAD 250. The High Court answered in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee, the following question:
"Whether, the Appellate Tribunal is correct and justified in law in holding that the expression 'an assessment' to be made u/s. 143(3), used in section 144B, is confined only to the assessment to be made u/s. 143 and does not cover reassessment to be made u/s. 147 of the Income-tax, Act with the consequence that the procedure prescribed under section 144B and extended time limit provided in the Explanation to s. 153(1) is not available to reassessment to be made u/s. 147 ?"
2.  The identical issue was raised before this court in the case of R. Dalmia v. CIT 1999 Indlaw SC 1137 and, following that judgment, the judgment and order of the High Court must be reversed and the question answered in the negative and in favour of the Revenue.
Order on the appeal accordingly. No order as to costs
Order accordingly.
