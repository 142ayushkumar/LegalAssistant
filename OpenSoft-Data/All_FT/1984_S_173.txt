Smt. Rajmata Vijai Raje Sindia and Another v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 October 1984
C.A. No. 4289 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  It was not disputed before us that there is no. limitation prescribed for the purpose of filing a writ petition against any executive action that might be impugned. Ordinarily the writ petitions are expected to be filed without any laches.
2.   In this case, since the petition was , filed not within 90 days, which was erroneously regarded as a prescribed period of limitation the petition has been dismissed on the technical ground being barred by limitation. We may observe that the petition was filed within a period of 4 months. The impugned order is, therefore, set aside and the Writ Petition No. 8827 of 1978 filed by Smt. Vijai Raje Sindia and anr. is remanded back to the High Court for disposal on merits in accordance with law.
3.  The appeal is disposed of accordingly with no. order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
