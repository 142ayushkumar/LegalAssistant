Reform Flour Mills Private Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax, Calcutta
Supreme Court of India

11 December 1969
The Judgment was delivered by: SHAH, AG. J.
1.  The High Court has not delivered any judgment giving reasons for rejecting the application u/s. 66(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922, after the rule was issued. As we have held in this court that once a rule is issued some reasons must be given for deciding the reference against the party applying, and since no reasons have been given, the order of the High Court is set aside and the cases are remanded to the High Court to be dealt with and disposed of in accordance with law. No order as to costs. Appeal allowed. Case remanded.
Appeal allowed.
