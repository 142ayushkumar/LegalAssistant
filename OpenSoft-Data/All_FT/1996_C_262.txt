Commissioner of Income Tax, Madurai v Shri S. S. Krishnamoorthy, Dindigul
Supreme Court of India

30 January 1996
Tax Reference Cases Nos. 6-10 of 1982 with Tax Reference Cases Nos. 2-8 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal has directly referred the following question to this Court:
"Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case, the income arising to the spouse and minor children of an individual from a firm could be added to the total income of that individual assessee notwithstanding that the income arising from that firm to that individual is not assessed in his hands ?"
2.  The assessment years with which we are concerned are Assessment Years 1973-74 to 1977-78. The assessee is an individual. He was a partner in a firm called M/s. S. S. Krishnamoorthy and the share of income from the firm was assessed in the hands of an HUF consisting of the assessee and his wife. In Assessment Years 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76 there arose to the minor sons of the assessee, by reason of their being admitted to the benefits of the partnership aforementioned, income therefrom. In Assessment Years 1976-77 and 1977-78, by reason of a reconstitution of the partnership, income arose to the assessee's wife because she became a partner in the firm. The question was whether the income of the minor sons for the earlier assessment years and of the wife for the later assessment years could be clubbed with that of the assessee.
3.  The reference was made directly to this Court because of a divergence in the views of the High Courts. The question now stands covered insofar as it relates to the period up to 31-3-1976 by the decision of this Court in CIT v. Om Prakash 1995 Indlaw SC 6521995 Indlaw SC 652and, by reason thereof, for Assessment Years 1973-74 to 1975-76, the question is answered in the negative and in favour of the assessee.
4.   For the other assessment years, there was no change in the law and, even as regards the wife of the assessee, the rationale of the aforesaid judgment applies, so that for these assessment years also the question is answered in the negative and in favour of the assessee. There shall be no order as to costs. TRCs Nos. 2-8 of 1985.
5.  In this direct reference by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, the following questions are raised:
"1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the share income as also the interest received on the capital contributed by the wife from the firm in which the assessee husband was a partner, representing as the karta of his HUF, is to be clubbed in the hands of the assessee husband in 'individual' assessment for each of the Assessment Years 1967-68 to 1973-74 u/s. 64(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act, 1961?
2. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the assessment of the assessee for each of the years under consideration has been validly reopened u/s. 147(a) of the Income Tax Act, 1961?"
6.  The assessment years are indicated in the first question itself, as are the facts. The first question stands covered by the decision of this Court in CIT v. Om Prakash 1995 Indlaw SC 6521995 Indlaw SC 652 by reason of which and, by reason it is answered in the negative and in favour of the assessee. Having regard to the answer to the first question, it is unnecessary to deal with the second question. The reference is answered accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
Reference answered in favour of Assessee.
