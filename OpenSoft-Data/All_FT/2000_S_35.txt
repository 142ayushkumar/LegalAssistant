S. Retnam v Sasthayyan
Supreme Court of India

27 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3963/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petition stated that the matter might be disposed of at the S.L.P. stage by setting aside the impugned order of the High Court and remanding the proceedings to the High Court for reconsidering the question regarding the applicability of the first proviso to Section 11(3) of the Kerala Building (Lease and Rent Control) Act.
2.  We have now heard learned counsel, seen the orders of the courts below and the relevant pleadings. We are of the view that the appropriate order to pass is that which was indicated in the notice.
3. We do not say more because we do not wish to prejudice the case on either side.
4.  The civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The civil revision petition (No.1736/99-C) is restored to the file of the High Court of Kerala to be heard afresh, having regard to what is stated above. This shall be done expeditiously.
5.  Till such time as this is done, the ad-interim stay of the decree for possession granted by this court on 28th February, 2000 shall continue.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
