Mohd. Aziz Khan v Manaklal
Supreme Court of India

10 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14826/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Special leave petition is dismissed since the order impugned as produced does not convey any sense whatsoever.
2.  Learned counsel appearing in support of the petition however contended that since the High Court issued the certified copy in the manner as it has been annexed and produced before this Court, no fault can be attributed to him. We are not inclined however to accept, in the apex Court, the papers as it is in the petition presently.
3. The special leave petition thus stands rejected. The learned counsel would be at liberty to take appropriate steps in the matter. This order of rejection however would not prevent the petitioner to move afresh.
Petition dismissed.
