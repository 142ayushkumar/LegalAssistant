C.As. Nos. 2610 of 1969 and No. 1138 of 1970.
The Judgment was delivered by: KHANNA, J.
1.  At the hearing the appeals, the parties have entered into a settlement and it is agreed that for each of the years 1963-64 and 1964-65 the bonus payable by Orissa Road Transport Co. Ltd. to its employees would be equal to two months' wages. The company would be entitled to deduct out of the bonus payable the amount already paid as advance bonus and shall pay the balance within two months from today. It is also agreed that the question as to whether S. 20 of the Payment of Bonus Act is applicable to the above mentioned company shall remain open and may be agitated in the references which are now pending before the tribunal for the year subsequent to 1964-65. The settlement in respect of payment of bonus for the year 1964-65 will not involve by implication a decision on the point that the above mentioned company is governed by S. 20 of the Payment of Bonus Act.
2.  The appeals are accordingly disposed of in the above terms. The parties will bear their own costs throughout.
Appeals disposed of.
