Commissioner of Wealth Tax, West Bengal v Gauri Shankar Bhar
Supreme Court of India

8 November 1971
The Judgment was delivered by: HEGDE J.
1.  The learned Solicitor-General appearing for the Commissioner of Wealth-tax very appropriately conceded that the property with which we are concerned in this case was the individual property of the deceased Prafulla Chandra Bhar. He also conceded that on the death of the said Prafulla Chandra Bhar the property devolved on his heirs in severalty. Each one of his heirs took a definite share in the property left by the deceased.
2.  In view of that concession it is not necessary for us to decide in this case whether a Dayabhaga Hindu family can be considered as a Hindu undivided family within the meaning of s. 3 of the Wealth-tax Act, 1957 Quite clearly on the facts of this case the heirs of the deceased took the property of the deceased in separate shares. Therefore, in law each one of them is liable to pay wealth-tax as individual. It cannot be said that an individual who inherits some property from some one becomes a Hindu undivided family merely because he is a member of the Hindu undivided family.
3.  In this view of the matter we find no substance in this appeal and the appeal is accordingly dismissed. The respondent has not appeared in this case. Hence there will be no order as to costs. We are thankful to Mr. T. A. Ramachandran for appearing as amicus curiae in this case at our request.
Appeal dismissed.
