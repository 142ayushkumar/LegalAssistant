1.  This Writ Petition has been filed by some of the land holders who are affected by the Consolidation Scheme framed in regard to Shamlat Deh lands of the concerned villages. The said scheme was challenged by some other proprietors and co-sharers in Civil Writ Petition No. 18310 of 1998 before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. The said writ petition having been dismissed, Civil Appeal No. 646 of 2000 was preferred before this Court by Special Leave. Dispite the order of status-quo granted by this Court pending the appeal, the petitioners alleged that they were before displaced since they were not parties in the writ petition filed before the High Court.
2.  They, therefore, filed the instant writ petition which has been heard along with civil Appeal No. 646 of of 2000.
3.  We have delivered our judgment today dismissing the Civil Appeal No. 646 of 2000. We find no merit in this writ petition filed by the petitioners and the same is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed
