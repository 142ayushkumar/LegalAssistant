Lakhbir Singh and Others v Jai Kumar
Supreme Court of India

24 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.444-445/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties.We find, the impugned order is an order passed by the High Court in review which was preferred by the appellants-defendants for recalling the Order dated 16th March, 2000.
2.  The High Court rejected the review not on merits but by not condoning the delay in filing review. We have perused the said order and heard learned counsel for the parties. On the facts and circumstances of this case, we feel it appropriate in the interest of justice that the delay in filing the review is condoned.
3. Accordingly, the said order of the High Court is set aside and the case is remanded back to the High Court for deciding the review itself in accordance with law after giving reasonable opportuny to the parties. The present appeals are allowed. Costs on the parties.
4.  Learned counsel for the respondent then submitted for expediting the matter in the High Court. It is not appropriate for this Court to pass such an order. However, this is without prejudice to the rights of the respondent to make such a prayer before the High Court.
Appeals allowed.
