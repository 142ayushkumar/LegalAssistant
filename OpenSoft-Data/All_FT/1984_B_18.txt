Bharat Roadways, A Partnership Firm v Shailendra Kumar Birla
Supreme Court of India

30 January 1984
C.A. No. 508 of 1984 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) No. 6 of 1984).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The finding recorded by the High Court on the basis of default in payment of arrears of rent is unsustainable and it is set aside. The High Court has not properly considered the alternative ground urged by the landlord that the premises were required by him for his own bona fide use and occupation.
2.   We therefore, set aside the judgment of the High Court and remand the case to it to re-examine the question whether the landlord bona fide needs the premises for his own occupation. If the High Court comes to the conclusion that the premises are bona fide needed by the landlord for his own occupation, the High Court shall also consider the case of the tenant under the proviso to cl. (c) sub-s. (1) of S. 11 of the Rent Act.
3.  The appeal is accordingly disposed of with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
