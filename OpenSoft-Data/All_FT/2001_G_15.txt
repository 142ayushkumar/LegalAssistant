G.M., Syndicate Bank and Anr v A. Madhusudan Rao
Supreme Court of India

19 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3175-3176/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard Shri V.R. Reddy, learned senior counsel for the petitioners and Shri A. Subba Rao, learned counsel for the respondent.
2.  On perusal of the records and on consideration of the contentions raised by learned counsel for the parties we are not satisfied that the judgment/order under challenge calls for interference except to the extent that the High Court was not right in directing the petitioner to serve a copy of the report of the preliminary enquiry on the delinquent. The direction to that effect is set aside. The other directions in the judgment/order shall remain unaltered.
The Special Leave Petitions are disposed of on the above terms.
3.  The respondent will appear before the Enquiry Officer and render necessary assistance/co-operation for expeditious disposal of the enquiry proceeding. Time for concluding the enquiry is extended by three months from today.
Petitions disposed of.
