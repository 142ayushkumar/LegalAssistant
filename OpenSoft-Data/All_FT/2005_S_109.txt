Appeal (Civil)  1235 of 1999
The Judgment was delivered by : B. P. Singh, J.
1.  We have heard counsel for the appellant State and also perused the order of the High Court.
2.  In a case under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') the High Court after considering the evidence on record found that the prosecution has not been able to make out a case under Section 16(1)(a)(ii) read with Section 7 of the Act. It accordingly allowed the appeal and acquitted the respondent.
3.  We have gone through the material on record and heard counsel for the appellant.
We find no reason to interfere with the order of acquittal.
These appeals are, therefore, dismissed.
Appeal dismissed
