Gurbachan Lal v State of Punjab and Another
Supreme Court of India

18 September 1986
Cr.A. No. 486 of 1986 (In S.L.P. 2005 of 1986)
The order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted limited to the question of sentence only.
1.  There is no ground to interfere with the judgment of the courts below. On a consideration of the evidence, the learned Additional Sessions Judge has convicted the appellant under Section 11 (1) of the Punjab Regulation of Colonies Act, 1975. Undoubtedly, the act of the appellant as co-sharer of a compact block of land admeasuring 36 kanals 18 marlas in carving out and selling distinct plots in favour of a number of persons, at least five in number, for the purpose of construction of residential houses, amounts to a contravention of Sections 3 (1), 4 (2) and 8 (1) of the Act.
2.   No other view that the one reached by the Learned Additional Sessions Judge is possible. As regards the sentence although the appellant is guilty of violation of the provisions of a consequential legislation, we feel that a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months with enhanced fine of Rs. 1000 or in default, to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months would meet with the ends of justice. We order accordingly.
3.   The amount of fine shall be deposited in the Court of the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Jullundhur within two weeks from today.
With this modification, the appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
