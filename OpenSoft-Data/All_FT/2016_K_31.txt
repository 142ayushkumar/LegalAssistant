1. Leave granted.
2. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants has submitted that the appeal was allowed by the High Court without framing the questions of law. The said fact has not been disputed by the learned counsel for the respondents.
3. In the circumstances, the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court is set aside and the matter is remanded to the High Court, so that it can be decided afresh after framing the questions of law and hearing the concerned parties.
4. The appeal is disposed of as allowed with no order as to costs.
5. As the appeal is quite old, we are sure that the High Court shall decide the same as soon as possible. The parties would appear before the High Court on 22nd August, 2016, so that the date for the hearing of the appeal can be fixed.
