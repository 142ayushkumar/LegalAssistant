The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  A large number of matters relating to the Land Acquisition Act are before us. They have been tagged together, but analysis shows that they fall into three different groups. The first group relates to the question, broadly, whether the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act as regards solatium and interest are to be read into the provisions of the various Improvement Trust Acts.
The second group relates to the question whether the aforesaid provisions are to be read into the Defence of India Act, the Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act and other such statutes.
2. In the third group, the question is whether the Defence of India Act violates Article 14 of the Constitution for the reason that it makes no provision for solatium and interest.
3.  If the Court were to decide that the provisions in the Land Acquisition Act regarding interest and solatium are incorporated into the Defence of India Act, the question of the vires thereof would not arise.
4.  The orders of reference in regard to the matters in the first and second groups are made by Benches of two learned Judges to larger Benches, that is to say, to Benches of three learned Judges.
Only the question of vires has been referred by a Bench of three learned Judges to a Constitution Bench.
5.  It is, therefore, appropriate to direct that all matters in the first group [Civil Appeals Nos. 1164-1200 of 1993, 9209, 9210, 9213, 9214, 9260-61, 839 of 1995, 3789 of 1992, 9207, 9206 of 1995, 6590, 6591 6592 of 2001, 9211, 9212, 9208 of 1995, SLPs (C) Nos. 12949 of 1992, 3331 of 1993, 3210 of 1999 and 8256-59 of 1993] and in the second group [SLPs (C) Nos. 17654-57 of 1994, 11687, 17079 of 2000, 533 of 2001, CC No. 4700 of 2001, Civil Appeals Nos. 5721-22 of 1998 and 1898-1923 of 1992] be decided by a Bench of three learned Judges and that the matter in the third group (Civil Appeals Nos. 967-70 of 1990) should remain before the Constitution Bench, to await such decision.
6. We make it clear that what we have just said is not in the nature of a decision on any aspect and every available point can be taken by the parties to the appeals, including that one or the other of them does not raise any of these issues.
Order accordingly.
