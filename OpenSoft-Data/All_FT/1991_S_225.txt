Karnataka Engineers Association and Another Sri v State of Karnataka
Supreme Court of India

29 October 1991
W.P. (Civil) Nos. 561 of 1989 and 101 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On February 14, 1991, counsel for the State of Karnataka had informed this Court that a Sub-Committee has looked into the Report of Justice Chinnappa Reddy and the Chief Minister had come forward publicly to say that the recommendations would be implemented. Thereafter, it appears that when these matters again came up before this Court on August 21, 1991, the learned Advocate-General of Karnataka stated that questions involved were under consideration and would be finalised within the time sought. The cases were, therefore, adjourned to October 22, 1991. Today, the learned counsel for the State of Karnataka prays that as the question involved in these petitions is whether the total reservation can in law exceed 50 per cent is also in issue before a nine Judge bench of this Court, these cases should be tagged on with those cases which arise out of 'The Mandal Commission Recommendations'.
2.   We are also told that a Constitution Bench is likely to give directions in those cases on October 31, 1991. Since the paper books in connection with the cases arising out of the Mandal Commission Report are not before us, we are not in a position to appreciate if the issue arising in these petitions is identical to that arising in those cases.
3.   We therefore, deem it proper that these petitions should be placed before the Constitution Bench on October 31, 1991 for appropriate directions whether or not to tag these petitions with those cases which are to be heard by a nine Judge bench.
Order accordingly.
