1.  Objections raised to the award being made Rule of Court are two in number. The first is that the Arbitrator should not have awarded a sum of Rs 1,000 as damages and that the damage to the Union of India is at a much higher figure. The second objection is that the Arbitrator should not have awarded interest at the rate of 15 per cent from March 1979 to 1990 on the price outstanding and unpaid.
2.  As is obvious, these objections pertain to the merits of the case. These are not entertained able as objections to the award. Nothing is reflected in the objection petition as to the conduct of the Arbitrator or to the arbitration proceedings. The objections have thus no merit and accordingly the same are dismissed. Correspondingly, the award is made Rule of the Court. I.A. No. 2 and C.A. No. 6256 of 1990 are disposed of accordingly.
