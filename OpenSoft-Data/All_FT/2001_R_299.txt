Bhagwanti J. Patel v Registrar, H.C. of Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

25 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7998/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The order of transfer dated 24th April, 1997 has since been obeyed by the petitioner.
2.  After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Solicitor General for the High Court of Gujarat, we made a suggestion to the learned Solicitor General that keeping in view all facts and circumstances of the case and the time that has elapsed after charge-sheets dated 26.6.1997 and 26.5.1998 were drawn up against the petitioner, the High Court may consider whether it is now desirable to pursue those charge-sheets any further. The learned Solicitor General submits that he shall convey the suggestion to the High Court.
3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner in view of the suggestion made by the Court submits that the petitioner may be permitted to withdraw this special leave petition and that she would also withdraw the writ petition filed before the High Court so that the High Court may take appropriate decision on the administrative side regarding the two charge-sheets.
4. We record the statement of learned counsel for the parties and dismiss this special leave petition as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
