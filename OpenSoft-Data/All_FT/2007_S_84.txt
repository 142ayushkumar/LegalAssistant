Raja Ram Sharma and others v Sarvhitkari Junior High School and another
Supreme Court of India

10 August 2007
C.A. No. 3661 of 2007 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 7452 of 2007)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard learned counsel for the appellants and Respondent 1, who appears on caveat.
2.  By the impugned order, the High Court dismissed the writ appeal and refused the prayer made on behalf of the appellants for directing Respondent 1 to relax the age bar in the matter of future appointments on the ground that the appointment was made without following the procedure prescribed under the law, especially there being no advertisement before making the same. It appears that the appellants have worked for about two decades.
3. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the impugned order of the High Court refusing relaxation in the matter of age bar is required to be modified.
4.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part and the impugned order is modified to this extent that if in future advertisements are issued, it would be open to the appellants to apply and if they are otherwise found eligible and suitable, the age bar in relation to the appellants shall be relaxed. No costs.
Appeal partly allowed.
