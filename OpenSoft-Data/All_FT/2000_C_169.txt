Madan Lal Patodia v Commissioner of Gift Tax
Supreme Court of India

1 November 2000
Civil Appeal No.3528/1997 With C.A.No.3529/1997
The Order of the Court was as Follows :
BY THE COURT
1. We have read the judgment of the High Court that is under appeal and it does appear to us that the High Court has proceeded upon a factual basis that is not indicated anywhere in the other of the Tribunal, which is the final fact-finding authority. The learned Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the Revenue, fairly, does not dispute this position. In his submission, however, the order of the Tribunal is erroneous by reason of the decision of this Court in Bharat Hari Singhania & Ors. vs. CWT & Ors. 1994 Indlaw SC 1335 : 1994 Indlaw SC 1335 (SC) : TC 63R.362. This is not a case that was argued before the High Court and is not a case which was known to the assessee
2. We think, therefore, in the circumstances that it is appropriate to allow the appeals, set aside the order under appeal and restore the reference [Matter No. 2858  of 1991] to the file of the High Court at Calcutta to be heard and disposed of afresh. It is made clear that it shall be open to both parties to raise appropriate contentions
Order on the appeals accordingly
No order as to costs
