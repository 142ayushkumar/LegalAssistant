Timmappa v Spl. Land Acquisition Officer
Supreme Court of India

18 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16228-16229/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant herein, aggrieved against the judgment and decree passed by the District Judge filed an appeal before the High Court for enhancement of the compensation. Since the requisite court fee was not paid, the appellant made a prayer to the Court for grant of time to pay the court fee. The High Court granted six weeks time to the appellant to remove the deficiency in the court fee. It appears that the appellant, despite time being granted, did not furnish the court fee.
2.  With the result, the appeal memo was rejected. The prayer for grant of further time to make the deficit court fee good was also rejected. The application for re-calling the said order was also rejected. Against the said order, the appellant has filed these appeals by way of special leave petitions.
3.  Despite notice issued to the respondent, none has put in appearance. We, therefore, proceed with the matter in the absence of the respondent. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and looked into the record. We are satisfied that the appellant has made out a sufficient cause for extension of time to pay the deficit court fee. We, therefore, permit the appellant to pay the requisite court fee within eight weeks from today.
4. In the aforesaid view of the matter, we set aside the order under challenge. The appeals are allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.It is made clear that if the appellant does not pay the court fee within eight weeks from today, this order shall stand automatically vacated. In case the requisite court fee is paid, the High Court shall proceed to decide the appeal of the appellant on merits.
Appeals allowed.
