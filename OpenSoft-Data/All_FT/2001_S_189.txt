Secunderabad Health Care Limited and Others v Secunderabad Hospital Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

25 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11183/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
Leave is granted.
1.  This appeal is directed against an interlocutory order passed by the Division Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court at Hyderabad in C.M.P.No.9375/2000 in C.C.C.A.No.129/99 on July 12, 2000.
2.  By the impugned order the Bench directed the appellant to deposit a further sum of Rs.24 lakhs. This was in addition to an amount of Rs.37 lakhs which was directed to be deposited by the orders passed on CMP.No.15341/99 dated July 29, 1999 and January 19, 2000. Be that as it may, after arguing the appeal for some time the learned counsel -2- for the parties agreed for a consent order to the effect that the impugned order may be set aside and the matter be remitted to the High Court for fresh disposal of CMP.No.9375/2000 in accordance with law.
3.  In view of the facts and the circumstances of the case we feel that the consensus so arrived would meet the ends of justice. We set aside the order under challenge accordingly and remit the case to the High Court.
4. The High Court may consider passing order afresh on the said C.M.P.after giving opportunity to the appellant herein (respondent therein) for filing counter and hearing it or having regard to the fact that the appeal itself was heard and judgment was reserved once, if it considers it appropriate to decide the appeal itself expeditiously, it may do so.
5.  The appeal is accordingly disposed of. In the circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs.
6.  The Registry is directed to send back the original record to the High Court at an early date.
Appeal disposed of.
