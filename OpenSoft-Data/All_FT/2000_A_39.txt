A.C. Thalwal v High Court of Himachal Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 December 2000
I.A. Nos.9-10 In C.A..No.9389-9390/1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These applications are filed by the respondent - High Court of Himachal Pradesh seeking clarification in the judgment dated 17.8.2000 passed by this Court in Civil Appeals Nos.9389-9390 of 1995. Learned counsel for the appellant is present and takes notice. He does not oppose the prayer for clarification in the terms sought for by the respondent - High Court.
2.  It is pointed out that in the operative part of the judgment, there is an innocuous error occurring because of a mis-apprehension that the post of Sr. Sub-Judge-cum- Chief Judicial Magistrate is a post of promotion. Both the learned counsel agree that under the H.P. Judicial Service Rules, 1973, the post of Sr. Sub-ordinate Judge/Chief Judicial Magistrate is filled on the basis of length of service put in by an officer in the sub-ordinate judiciary.
3.  It is clarified that the appellant - A.C. Thalwal shall continue to hold the post of Sr. Sub-Judge-cum-Chief Judicial Magistrate until he becomes entitled to hold the post, consequent upon the requisite length of service in accordance with the service Rules having been completed and his seniority in the cadre of Sr. Sub- Judge-cum-Chief Judicial Magistrate shall be reckoned from such date with which he becomes entitled to hold the post in the light of the judgment of this Court. The sentence "if he may be found not fit for promotion then he may be reverted to the post of Sub-Judge-cum-Judicial Magistrate", being unnecessary, is directed to be deleted. It is made clear that insofar as the merits of the appeals are concerned, the judgment dated 17th August, 2000 remains unaltered. The applications are disposed of accordingly.
Order accordingly.
