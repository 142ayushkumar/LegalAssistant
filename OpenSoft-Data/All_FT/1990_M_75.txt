Awadh Rai and Others v Mewalal Rai and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 July 1990
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 1225 of 1989 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 25 May 1988 of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in 2nd Appeal No. 521 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Heard learned counsel for the parties. We are of the view that the statutory scheme of the Bihar Consolidation of Holdings (Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1956 does not bring about an automatic abatement of the pending proceedings in the civil court but it is not necessary that a formal application should be made; if and when the matter is brought to the notice of the court that the relevant notification under the Consolidation Act has been made, the court after hearing the parties can make an order to the effect that there is an abatement.
2. On the question of abatement of the appeal, it is open to either of parties to move the High Court, if so advised, but we express no opinion on merits. The special petition is disposed of.
Petition diposed of.
