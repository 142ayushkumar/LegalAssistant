The order of the court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We find the High Court and the Appellate Court have considered the matter in accordance with law. A finding of fact has been recorded that in terms of Section 13(2)(V) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949, the tenant has ceased to occupy the building for a continuous period of more than four months without any reasonable cause. This being finding of fact, does not call for any interference by 
this Court in the present proceedings.
Accordingly, the present petition is dismissed. Costs on the parties.
2.  However, on the facts and in the circumstances of this case, we observe that the petitioner shall vacate the premises in question by or before the 31st October, 2001 subject to the usual undertaking to be filed within four weeks from today.
Petitions dismissed.
