Collector of Central Excise, New Delhi v Bhiwani Textile Mills
Supreme Court of India

3 October 1996
C.A. No. 1086 of 1987
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  This appeal against the order of the Central Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal covers two aspects.
2.  The aspect of classification is covered against the respondents, it is fairly stated, by the decision of this Court in Collector of Central Excise v. Rajasthan Spg. Wvg. Mills Ltd. 1992 Indlaw SC 81990 Indlaw SC 525. To that extent, the order of the Tribunal must be upheld.
3.  The other aspect is of the demand for duty. The demand was made on 17th March, 1980. The clearances were made from 26th July, 1979 to 24th January, 1980. There was no proposal for modification of the classification for this period. It was only on 25th January, 1980, that the proposal was mooted.
The decision of this Court in Union of India and Ors. v. Madhumilan Syntex Pvt. Ltd. 1988 Indlaw SC 3951988 Indlaw SC 395 covers the case against the appellant.
4.  The result is that although the appellant succeeds on the aspect of classification, he shall not be able to enforce the demand made by the said notice. The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal partly allowed.
