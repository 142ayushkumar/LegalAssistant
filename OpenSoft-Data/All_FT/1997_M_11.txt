M. C. D. v Delhi Outdoor Advertisers' Association and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 February 1997
I.A. No. 1 in C.A. No. 10421 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
The appeal is taken on board.
1.  Heard the learned counsel for the parties. Since the hoardings have been removed, the grievance of the MCD does not survive so far as that aspect is concerned. However, the learned counsel for the MCD contends that the Division Bench of the High Court was wrong holding that before removal of the hoardings a show-cause notice is a must.
We think that the learned counsel for the MCD is on a firm ground so far as this contention is concerned because once the period of the contract comes to an end by efflux of time the right to advertise ceases and the hoardings ought to be removed and there is no question of the removal being preceded by a show-cause notice.
2. Therefore, the observation of the Division Bench to this extent does not appear to be correct. The appeal will stand disposed of with this modification in the order. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
