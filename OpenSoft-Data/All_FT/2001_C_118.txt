State of Rajasthan and Anr v Chandra Shekhar and Anr
Supreme Court of India

27 September 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3441/1998
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  The question raised in these appeals is as to whether the respondents would be entitled to grant of increments during the period of their temporary service.
2. Answer to this question would certainly depend on the terms of service upon which they were employed.
3.  The High Court has examined this aspect of the matter and has found that they had been appointed to a particular post which carries a time scale and pay. If that is so, if the benefits arising therein in granting the increments had been given, we do not think there is any infirmity in the order made by the High Court.
These appeals are, therefore, dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
