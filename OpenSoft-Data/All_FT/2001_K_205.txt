Kishore Chand v State, Government of N.C.T. Delhi
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2922/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner has been convicted under section 279/304-A by the Magistrate concerned against which an appeal was filed, and that appeal stood dismissed. The petitioner appears to have filed a Revision before the High Court, which is stated to be pending. The petitioner filed an application for early hearing of the Revision. That having been dismissed, and the prayer for suspension of sentence having been not allowed, the petitioner has approached this Court.
2.  In view of the rules of the Court, we see no infirmity with the order of the High Court in not entertaining a Revision unless and until the accused surrenders. Be that as it may, the petitioner has already surrendered while the matter is pending before this Court. In these circumstances, we direct that the petitioner's Revision application, stated to be pending in the High Court, may be taken up for consideration on its own merits. We make it clear that we have expressed no opinion as to the merits of the Revision whether it may be entertained or would be dismissed.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly.
3.  In the event, the petitioner's Revision is entertained for being disposed of on merits by the Court, it would be open for the petitioner to move the appropriate application under the Criminal Procedure Code  
for suspension of sentence.
Petition disposed of.
