Rajendra Verma (Dead) By Lrs v Shiv Sharan Singh
Supreme Court of India

9 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9311/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  It is not disputed that Uday Singh died on 16.10.1996. It is also not disputed that no substitution application was filed for bringing on record the heirs of Uday Singh before the High Court. The High Court decided the matter on 10.5.2000. In absence of any substitution application, the appeal, in fact, has abated and the appeal did not call for dismissal on merits.
2. Under such circumstances, we set aside the judgment under appeal and send the case back to the High Court. However, it will be open to the appellants to move an application for substitution before the High Court which shall be dealt with in accordance with law.
The appeal stands disposed of in the above terms.
Appeal disposed of.
