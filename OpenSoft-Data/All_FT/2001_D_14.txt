Bharati Ray v D.N. Rao and Others
Supreme Court of India

12 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.)........2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that some of the observations made in the impugned order may be treated by the trial court as final on the appreciation of the contentions.
2. We do not feel that there is any scope for any court treating the observations made in an order passed under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 
as sufficient for considering at the final stage.
This observation is now to allay any fear which the petitioner states to be entertaining.
The SLP is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
