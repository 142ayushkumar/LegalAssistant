Sukh Deo Narain v State of Rajasthan
Supreme Court of India

20 July 1984
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Transfer Petition (Civil) No. 344 of 1983
The Judgment was delivered by : O. Chinnappa Reddy, J.
1. This petition is totally bereft of any statement of facts. It has been drafted and filed in a most casual and careless manner. All that is stated in the petition is that the Writ Petition pending in the Rajasthan High Court raises exactly the same questions as those raised in SLP (Civil) No. 7561/83 pending in this Court and the writ petition may, therefore, be transferred to this Court.
2. Nothing else is mentioned. No facts relating to either case are mentioned. Even the alleged common questions are not stated. We can only say that it is most discourteous and disrespectful to the highest court in the country to file such indifferent petitions. The advocate is not discharging his duty either to the court or to the client.
