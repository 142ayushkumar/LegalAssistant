State of Rajasthan v K.D. Khinchi
Supreme Court of India

16 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.2473/2001
The Order of the Court was follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard Mr. Jain for the State of Rajasthan and Mr. Aruneshwar Gupta for the respondent. In view of the prayer of the respondent in the writ petition which is the subject matter of consideration before the High Court, by way of interim direction the High Court could not have directed the State to consider the case for promotion of the respondent to the post of Additional Chief Engineer, which, in our opinion, is beyond the prayer sought for in the writ petition itself.
2. Therefore, while we do not interfere with the direction to consider the case of the respondent for promotion to the post of Superintending Engineer which would be subject to the final disposal of the writ petition, the subsequent direction to consider him for the post of Additional Chief Engineer cannot be sustained and we set aside that part of the order.
3.  Accordingly, the appeal is disposed of. The High Court is requested to dispose of the pending writ petition at an early date.
Appeal disposed of.
