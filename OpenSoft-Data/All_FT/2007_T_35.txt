Talat Fatima Hasan v Nawab Syed Murtaza Ali Khan(D)By Lrs. and others
Supreme Court of India

24 April 2007
C.A. No. 1773 of 2002 with C.A. No. 4012 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at great length.
2. We, however, feel that the question of interpretation of religious constitutional provisions under Articles 291, 362 and clause 12, of Article 366, of the Constitution, on the one hand, and the Covenants entered into by and between the Government of India and the then ruler of Rampur State, on the other, vis-a-vis the applicability of the provisions of Shariat Act, 1937, as extended to the State of Rampur w.e.f. 1.5.1950, fall for consideration in these appeals.
3.  Upon hearing the counsel for the parties at great length, we are of the opinion that the questions raised in these appeals are not only of great importance, there exists some sort of conflict in the decisions of this Court in Revathinnal Balagopala Varma vs. His Highness Shri Padmanabha Dasa Bala Rama Varma and Ors., 1991 Indlaw SC 401, His Highness Maharaja Pratap Singh vs. Her Highness Maharani Sarojini Devi and Ors., 1993 Indlaw SC 568, H.H. Maharaja dhiraja Madhav Rao Jivaji Rao Sc india Bahadur of Gwalior vs. Union of India, 1970 Indlaw SC 300, and some other earlier pronouncements made by this Court, we are of the opinion that the matter requires an authoritative pronouncement of this Court and thus should be referred to a larger Bench.
4. Let the records of this case be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for passing appropriate orders. Liberty to mention.
Order accordingly.
