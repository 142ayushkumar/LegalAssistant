State of Uttar Pradesh v Ram Karan Das and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 August 1987
C.A. No. 10128 of 1983 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 21 February 1983 of the High Court of Judicature in Allahabad in W.P. No. 10992 of 1980)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The only question which has been finally decided by the High Court was that plots Nos. 79 and 117 were not irrigated. The rest of the dispute was remanded to the ceiling authorities for determination. There was hardly scope for filing a special leave petition to this Court against the order of the High Court. The question as to whether those two plots were irrigated or were not irrigated was a pure question of fact and could not be subjected to decision of this Court by obtaining leave under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. This must, therefore, be styled as a frivolous petition for leave.
2.   It is unfortunate that the State of U.P. had decided to file such a frivolous petition. Filing frivolous petitions creates problem for the Registry of this Court and adds the bulk of the pending litigations. If the respondents has appeared, we would have given exemplary costs to them but since this petition is being dismissed ex parte, we direct the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 3000 in favour of the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee within three weeks from today.
3.  A copy of the entire order shall be communicated to the Legal Remembrancers to comply with the requirements of the payment.
Order accordingly.
