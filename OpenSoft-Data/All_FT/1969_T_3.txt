Supreme Court of India

5 February 1969
Civil Appeal No. 462 of 1966.Appeal by special leave from the order dated March 25, 1964 of the Bombay High Court in Letters Patent Appeal No. 28 of 1964.
The Judgment was delivered by : Ramaswami, J.
1. The question of law involved in this appeal is whether the primary liability is imposed on the appellant under the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 (Act No. 3 of 1888) to pay property taxes to the respondent i.e., the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay in respect of land-owned by the appellant and let on a monthly basis to a third party who has constructed a building thereon.
2. The appellant is a banking company incorporated in the United Kingdom and has established places of business in India. The appellant is the sole trustee of the estate of the late Mr. F. E. Dinshaw and in that capacity is the owner of a plot of land at Manchubhai Road, Malad, Greater Bombay in the State of Maharashtra, bearing No. P-Ward No. 6418, Street No. 299B. The said plot of land had been leased by the former trustee of the estate to one Mr. R.-R. Pande Thereinafter referred to as the lessee) since a number of years at a monthly rent of Rs. 12-50. The lessee had constructed at his own cost a tiled house on the said plot of land. The Malad area merged into Greater Bombay on 1st February, 1957. Upto the date of the merger the Malad District Municipality was. assessing and levying taxes on the land and the structure separately and recovering the same from the landlord and the tenant. After the merger, the Bombay Municipal Corporation issued a notice to the appellant u/s. 167 of the Act informing him that the assessment book had been amended by inserting, the name of the appellant and that the rateable value of the house had been fixed at Rs. 430/-. Being aggrieved by this order the appellant preferred an appeal to the Chief Judge Small Causes Court, Bombay u/s. 217 of the Act. The appeal was dismissed by the Chief Judge, Small, Causes Court by his order dated 3rd August, 1960. The appellant took the matter in further appeal to the Bombay High Court. The appeal was heard by Mr. Justice Patel and was dismissed on the 14th January, 1964. The learned Judge felt that he was bound by the decision of Chagla, C.J. and Shah, J. in , Ramji Keshavji v. Municipal Corporation for Greater Bombay.The appellant thereafter preferred a Letters Patent Appeal No. 28 of 1964 which was summarily dismissed by Chief Justice H. K. Chainani and Mr. Justice Gokhale on 25th March, 1964. The present appeal is brought by special leave from the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 25th March, 1964.

(b)the rateable value of each such building and land determined in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Act-
(c)the name of the person primarily liable for the payment of the property taxes, if any, leviable on each such building or land.......
10. It was contended by Mr. Khambatta that on a proper construction of s. 146(2) of the Act there should, have been separate assessments in respect of the building and the land in the present case. It was argued in the alternative that even if s. 146(2) of the Act contemplates a compo site assessment of the building and the land, the primary liability should be imposed upon the owner of the building and not on the owner of, the land. It was said that the right to let the building vests in the lessee of the land and not in the appellant, and so, the primary liability was upon the lessee under s. 146(2) of the Act. The argument was pressed that the appellant cannot be treated as a lessor under s. 146(2) of the Act, , because the appellant has not let the land with the building thereon as one unit to the lessee. The opposite viewpoint was presented on behalf of the respondent. It was, argued, in the first place, that s. 146(2) of the Act contemplates that there should be a composite assessment of the land and the building taken as one unit. In the case of such a composite assessment, the primary liability of the payment of tax was on the landlord under sub-s. (2)(a) of s. 146 except in the case, referred to in sub-s. (3) where the primary liability was-upon the tenant and not upon the landlord. Admittedly, the present case did not fall under s. 146(3), and, therefore, . the primary liability was placed upon the appellant.
11. In our opinion, the argument put forward on behalf of the respondent is well-founded and must be accepted as correct. In the first place, the language of s. 146(2) indicates that the Legislature contemplated that in a case where the land and the building are owned by different persons there should be a composite assessment of property tax. The reason is that in s. 146(1) and (2) the word premises' is used in contrast to s. 146(3) where the words 'land and building' are separately mentioned. In s. 154(1) of the Act again, the Legislature uses the expression 'building or land'. Then s. 155 provides for the right of the Commissioner to call information from the owner or the occupier in order to enable him to determine the rateable value of ;any building or land and the person primarily liable for the payment of any property, tax levied in respect thereof. S. 156 provides that the Commissioner shall maintain a book to be called 'the assessment book' which book is to contain among other things a list of all lands and buildings. Therefore, the scheme of s. 146 is that, when the land is let and the tenant has built upon the land, there should be a composite assessment of tax upon the land and building taken together. We are further of opinion that in the case of such a composite unit the primary liability of assessment of tax is intended to be on the lessor of the land under; s. 146(2)(a) of the Act. It was objected by Mr. Khambatta that the appellant was only the lessor of the land and not of the building, and so, the appellant cannot be held to be the lessor within the meaning of s. 146(2) (a). 'We do not think that there is any merit in this objection. S. 146(3) of the Act furnishes the key to the interpretation of s. 146(2)(a), in the context of s. 146(3) the lessor of the premises as mentioned in s. 146(2)(a) must be construed as to mean the lessor of the land on which the building has been constructed by the tenant.
12. In this connection, reference should be made to s. 147 which provides for an apportionment of responsibility for property tax when the premises assessed are let or sub-let. The language of this sub-section suggests that the lessor of the land has the right of recovering from his tenant the amount of tax which he has paid in excess, of the tax which the property is liable to pay on the basis of the rent recovered by the lessor. It is also clear that the intention, of the Legislature in fixing the primary liability of property tax upon the owner of the land in a case not falling under s. 146(3) of the Act is to facilitate the collection of, property tax. In the, case of a monthly tenant who puts up a temporary shack or asbestos shed on the land and who may at any time terminate the lease at a short notice, it is not always possible for the Corporation to keep track of the lessee and to collect the property tax from him. It is not unreasonable therefore that in a case of this description the Legislature should impose the primary liability for the payment of the property tax upon the lessor of the land and to give him the right of recoupment under section 147. A similar view with regard to the interpretation of section 146, of the Act was expressed by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court consisting of Chagla, C.J. and Shah, J. in Ramji Keshavji's  case. It was held by the learned judges in that case that where the owner of a land had leased it to a tenant for a period of one year and the tenant had put up a structure upon the land, the owner of the land was primarily liable to pay property tax together with the structure constructed thereon. Counsel on behalf of the appellant challenged the correctness of this decision, but for the reasons already expressed we hold that the ratio of this decision is correct.We Shall, however , assume in favour of the appellant that the meaning of s. 146 (2) of the Act is obscure and that' it is possible to interpret it as throwing the primary liability for payment of property tax upon the lessee who has constructed a, building on the land. Even upon that assumption we think that the view of the law expressed by the Bombay High Court in this case ought not to be interfered with. The reason is that in a case where the meaning of an enactment is obscure, the Court may resort to contemporary construction, that is the construction which the authorities have put upon it by their usage and conduct for a long period of time. The principle applicable is "optima legum interpres est consuetudo". In Ohlson's case , in dealing with the interpretation of s. 39 of the Pawnbrokers, Act, 1872, Stephen, J. said:
"What weighs with me very greatly in coming to the present conclusion is the practice of the Inland Revenue Commissioners for the past sixteen years. So long ago as 1874 this very point was decided by Sir Thomas Henry, for whose decisions we 'all have very great respect; and the least that can be said with regard to the case before him is that he pointedly called the attention of the commissioners to the case-the learned magistrate having offered to state a case-an offer refused by the , commissioner, who by their refusal must be taken to have acquiesced in the decision. 'Mat is a very strong contemporaneous exposition of the meaning of the Act"
13. The same principle was referred to by Lord Blackburn in Clyde Navigation Trustees v. Laird( [8] A.C. 658 670). The question in dispute in that case was, whether the Clyde Navigation Consolidation Act, 1858 imposed navigation dues on timber floated up the Clyde in logs chained together. From 1858 to 1882 dues had been levied on this class of timber without resistance from the owners; and some judges in the Court of Session suggested that this non- resistance might be considered in construing the statute. On this point Lord Blackburn said ." I think that submission raises a strong prima facie ground on which they (the owners) could not resist, And I think a court should be cautious, and not decide unnecessarily that there is no such ground. If the Lord President (Inglis) means no more than this when he calls it 'contemporanea exposito of the statutes which is almost irresistible', I agree with him. I do not think that he means that enjoyment at least for any period short of that which gives rise to prescription, if founded on a mistaken construction of a statute, binds the court so as to prevent it from giving the true construction. If he did, I should not agree with him, for whom I know of no authority, and am not aware of any principle, for so saying .
14. In our opinion, the principle of contemporanea exposito applies to the present case. The Act was passed in the year 1888 and there appears to be a practice followed by the Bombay Municipal corporation for a very long time of treating the land and the building constructed upon it as single unit and charging the property tax upon the owner of the land in a case where the land is let for a period of less than one year to a tenant who has constructed a building thereon . For the reasons expressed, we hold that there is no merit in this appeal which is accordingly dismissed with costs.
