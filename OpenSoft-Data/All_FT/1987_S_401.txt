State of Uttar Pradesh v Third Additional District Judge and Others
Supreme Court of India

12 August 1987
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 14556 of 1984 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 3 August 1984 of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad passed in W.P. No. 7147 of 1984)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. This special leave petition was filed in the year 1984 and was listed for consideration as to grant of leave today, about 38 months after its presentation. We find from the papers produced along with the special leave petition that apart from the dismissal order in limine by the High Court in regard to the application under Article 227 of the Constitution, no orders have been produced. In the absence of the relevant judicial orders which are sought to be assailed, this special leave petition is not complete.
2. When the counsel was confronted with this situation, he wanted time saying that the matter in this case involves serious questions of law and the Government of Uttar Pradesh will be hard hit if the matter is not looked into. If his representation is true, the conduct of the State Government would have been different viz., within 38 months appropriate documents would have been given to the court. We refuse to adjourn the matter and in view of non-availability of relevant documents before us we dismiss the special leave petition.
Petition dismissed.
