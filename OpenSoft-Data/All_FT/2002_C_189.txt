Common Cause, A. Regd. Society v Union of India and another
Supreme Court of India

12 September 2002
Review Petition (C) No. 891 of 2002 in RP (C) No. 98 of 1997 in W.P. (C) No. 26 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After delivering of the judgment in a writ petition filed under Article 32, a review petition had been filed, and that review petition had been entertained and finally disposed of. The present application purports to be a review petition against the reviewed judgment.
2. This application is wholly misconceived and there is no provision anywhere to file successive review petitions. The review petition is accordingly dismissed.
Review dismissed.
