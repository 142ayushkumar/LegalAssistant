Rajani Kislior Pardeshi pending before the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division at Panvel, Mumbai, Maharashtra to the Family Court of proper jurisdiction at Satana, Madhya Pradesh on the ground that she does not have financial capacity to contest the litigation at Mumbai and that she is staying with her brother.
2. She claims that her brother is unable to accompany her as he is also financially weak.
