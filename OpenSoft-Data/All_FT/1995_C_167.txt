Ramdas Laxmidas v Commissioner of Sales Tax
Supreme Court of India

1 February 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal by special leave is against the judgment of the Bombay High Court answering the question of law referred to it under Section 23(1) of the dealer. For claiming certain benefits, the dealer was required to produce declarations as required under Rule 26(2) of the Bombay Sales Tax Rules, 1946.
The dealer failed to produce those declarations and counterfoils. The dealer claimed that it was under no obligation to preserve those declarations beyond the period prescribed under Section 12-A (3) of the Act read with Rule 41-A of the rules framed therein. The High Court while rejecting the contention of the dealer observed as under:
"It is for an assessee to satisfy the assessing authority that he is entitled to the deduction or exemption claimed by him, and if the statute requires certain voluntarily destroys them, it is hardly open to an assessee to complain if the claim is disallowed."
2.  We find no infirmity in the view taken by the High Court. When the clear requirement of the statute is that for claiming the deduction, the dealer is required to produce certain documents in support of the claim.
3. Acceptance of the dealer's contention that it is not bound to produce the same at the time of assessment beyond a certain period of time, would result in negating the statutory provision which requires the deduction to be given only on production of the documents in support of that claim. This appeal must therefore fail.
Consequently, the appeal is dismissed.
No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
