V.S.T. Industries Limited v T. Chandrasekhara Sarma and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 December 2000
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 4106/1998
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  In a writ appeal before the High Court, an order was made stating that the amount involved in the matter was too trivial to need an examination by the High Court and therefore, directed the payment of that sum in full and final settlement of all claims thereto and that order was made in the special features of the case.
2. Therefore, when the High Court has not decided either any question of law or fact arising in the case we do not think that order will become a precedent to be applicable in any other case.
3.  In that view of the matter, we see no reason to interfere with the order made by the High Court. Subject to observations made above, this appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
