Bhagwan Mandal and Others v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

8  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.21314/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The writ petition filed by the appellants was dismissed. On a letters patent appeal being filed, the same was dismissed by the High Court without going into the merits.
2. The appeal was dismissed because of the earlier views accepted by the Single Judges of the said High Court.
3.  When there was a challenge to the decision of the Single Judge on merits, we are of the opinion that the letters patent appeal should have been disposed of on merits. Of course, it was open to the Division Bench to dismiss the letters patent appeal in limine, but that has not been done.
4. There is no indication that the merits of the case were considered by the Division Bench. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the order of the Division Bench which will now hear L.P.A. No. 1107/2000 afresh.
Appeal allowed.
