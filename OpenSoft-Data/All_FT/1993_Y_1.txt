Yadlapati Venkateswarlu v State of Andhra Pradesh and Another
Supreme Court of India

1 December 1993
C.A. No. 2494 of 1978
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal was heard by a Bench of this Court. The order was reserved. On 11-9-1990 the appeal was dismissed. The judgment was pronounced in the open Court. It was signed by the Hon'ble Judge who pronounced the judgment. But before the judgment could be placed for signature before the then Hon'ble Chief Justice, who was other member of the Bench, he suddenly died.
2.    The judgment is reported as in Yadlapati Venkateswarlu v. State of Andhra Pradesh 1990 Indlaw SC 5421990 Indlaw SC 542.
3.  The office appears to have noticed this mistake later. It was listed for orders. In February 1992 the Bench before which it was listed directed the learned counsel for the appellant to obtain instructions.
4.  We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant. He fairly stated that he would not stand by any technicality. And the judgment may be permitted to remain as such. We accept his submission. The judgment delivered earlier by this Court shall operate as such. No further order is necessary.
Order accordingly.
