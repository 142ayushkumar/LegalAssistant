Income Tax Officer v A.M.S. Salimaricar
Supreme Court of India

30 October 1996
C.As. Nos. 152 and 153 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals are preferred by the Revenue against the judgment of the Madras High Court 1972 Indlaw MAD 92, declaring sub-section (3) of section 140A of the Income-tax Act, 1961, as void on the ground that it is violative of article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution of India.
2. The said judgment has been disagreed to by almost all the High Courts in the country including the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Kashiram v. ITO 1975 Indlaw AP 43, the Karnataka High Court in K. Sampangirama Raju v. Fifth ITO 1987 Indlaw KAR 32, the Bombay High Court in CIT v. J. Pitambardas and Co. 1993 Indlaw MUM 6764 and the Kerala High Court in Mary Issac v. IAC 1984 Indlaw KER 66.
3.  We agree with the reasoning given by the Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Bombay and the Kerala High Courts and disagree with the reasoning and conclusions arrived at in the judgment under appeal.
4. Since, the provision has been repealed long ago, we do not think it necessary to say more on the subject except to say that these appeals are allowed and the judgment of the High Court is set aside. No costs.
Appeals allowed.
