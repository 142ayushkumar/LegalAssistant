V. R. Ajith Kumar v P. M. Suresh and others
Supreme Court of India

6 February 2007
C.A. No(s). 8601 of 2003
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard the parties.
1.  In this appeal the question arises for consideration is for the appointment to the post of Principal in a private aided S.N.M. College. The appeal is against the decision of the Full Bench of the High Court of Kerala. The appellant retired on 31.3.2004 as Selection Grade Lecturer. The respondent who is now holding the post of Principal is also due to retire on 31.3.2007. Undisputedly, the basic pay scale of Selection Grade Lecturer is Rs.12000-420-18300. The scale of pay of the Principal is also the same.
2. In other words, the Selection Grade Lecturer and the Principal are in the same pay scale. As the appellant has already retired as Selection Grade Lecturer, nothing remains to be considered in this appeal. We are also of the view that since the pay scale of Selection Grade Lecturer is same with the pay scale of Principal the appellant does not lose anything either. In this view of the matter, the appeal is disposed of as having become infructuous.
Appeal disposed of.
