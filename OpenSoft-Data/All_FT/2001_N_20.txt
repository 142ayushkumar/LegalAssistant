N.K. Agrawal and Another v Gupteshwar Prasad Srivastava and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13266/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  By the impugned order dated 6th June, 2001 show cause notice was issued by the High Court requiring the appellants herein to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for the non-compliance of an earlier order of the High Court dated 18th July, 2000. While directing the issuance of notice the High Court also directed that the appellants as well as one Shri N.K. Agarwal, Secretary/ Commissioner, Department of Finance, will not draw their salary and other allowances till further orders of the court.
2.  In our opinion, the aforesaid direction of the High Court is clearly unsustainable. Firstly, on the very day when the show cause notice was being issued without giving liberty to the petitioners, order was passed restraining them from receiving any salary.
3.  Furthermore, and what is more important, in the exercise of contempt jurisdiction no such order which is not contemplated by the provision of the Contempt of Courts Act could have been passed. Even the learned counsel for the respondent is unable to advance any argument in an effort to sustain the order. He, however, submits that there is no excuse for the non-compliance of the order dated 18.7.2000.
4. In response to this Mr. B.B. Singh states that an affidavit has been filed in the Court explaining the position.While we make no observation with regard to the pendency of the contempt petition before the High Court, we set aside that part of the order of the High Court which had directed that salary and allowances should not be paid to the appellants herein till further orders of the High Court.
The appeal is partly allowed in the aforesaid terms.
Appeal Partly Allowed.
