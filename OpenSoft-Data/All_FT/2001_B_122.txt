Bansilal v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14849/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to entertain this petition at this stage of the proceeding more so by reason of the fact that revision application is pending. Mr. Lalit appearing in support of the petition however contended that it may not be possible for the High Court to take up the matter for years together.
2. That however cannot possibly be a ground in the matter for entertaining the petition. Mr. Lalit's client would be at liberty to approach the High Court for expeditious disposal of the matter and the High Court will do well to dispose of the matter at the earliest.
The special leave petition is thus dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
