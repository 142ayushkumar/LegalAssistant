State of Haryana and Others v Subhash Sharma and Others
Supreme Court of India

28 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16204/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is surprising that the State of Haryana has come up against the impugned direction of the High Court requiring the CBI to investigate into certain allegations wherein a Cabinet Minister of the State Government is involved.
2.  On the basis of a petition filed by a Journalist and after due inquiry, the Court passed the impugned order. The learned Advocate General appearing for the State fairly expressed the view that a criminal case should be registered and inquired into. The request of the Advocate General, 2 however, was that the Vigilance Bureau should be directed to inquire into the matter. The Court however felt, and in our view rightly, that since a Minister of the Cabinet rank is involved, it would be more appropriate if the CBI is directed to inquire into the matter.
3. Ordinarily, the State/its Authorities should have suggested for inquiry by the CBI since the allegations are against a Cabinet Minister of the State Government.
4.  Mr. Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for the State, however, submitted that since the question whether without the consent of the State Government, a Court can direct CBI to investigate into a matter is pending before the Constitution Bench of this Court, this matter should be entertained and kept pending. It is, no doubt, true that the matter is pending since 10th March, 1989, but notwithstanding the same, we are of the considered opinion that we need not entertain this matter and, on the other hand, we direct the CBI to investigate into the matter as expeditiously as possibly and take a final decision on the allegations made.
5.  In fact the High Court itself has made the necessary direction to complete the investigation within six months.
The special leave petition stands dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
