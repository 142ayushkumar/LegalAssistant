Mehmood Mohammed Sayeed v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

16 February 2001
Cr.A. No. 200 of 2001 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 510 of 2001)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Leave granted.
2. Though learned Counsel for the State of Maharashtra opposed appellant to be released on bail we have taken note of the fact that appellant is remaining in custody from 18-1-2000 onwards. The offences alleged against him include Sections 463, 467, 461, 419 read with S. 120 of the Indian Penal Code.
Investigation is completed and the charge-sheet has been laid. What remains is only the trial. We do not know how long the trial will take, particularly, seeing the condition of the trial Courts in Maharashtra.
3. When learned Counsel for the State noticed that we are disposed to release the appellant on bail he alternatively pleaded that stringent conditions may be imposed on him because of the allegations that he has some links with the international terrorists gang. We, therefore, impose the following conditions on him:
1. He shall report to the Worli Police Station, Mumbai on every Monday between 4.00 p.m. and 6.00 p.m. until further orders; and
2. If, he is to leave the limits of Mumbai City Corporation he shall take permission from the trial Court.
4. If he is prepared to abide the above conditions he shall be released on bail on his executing a bond of Rs. 2 lacs with two solvent sureties to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
