The order of the Court was as follows:

Leave granted keeping in view this statement.
2.  It shall be open to the respondents to contend at the final hearing that the appeals are not maintainable because, according to the first respondent, the appellant had not filed an appeal before the Division Bench against the order of the learned Single Judge.
3.  Pending the disposal of the appeals, the order of the High Court, insofar as it relates to the claims of the appellant and the first respondent, shall remain stayed.
Order accordingly.
