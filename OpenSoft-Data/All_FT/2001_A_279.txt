Union of India v Ashwani Kumar Dixit
Supreme Court of India

30 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6840/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The question whether the respondent, an applicant for Indian Forest Service would be entitled to a third opportunity after having failed on two earlier occasions is the subject matter of consideration in the pending Writ Petition before the High Court. The Tribunal, on being approached by the respondent, directed the Union of India to grant such opportunity to the respondent.
Union of India assailed the order of the Tribunal in the Writ Petition. The High Court did not grant stay of the direction of the Tribunal.
2. On an application for contempt proceedings being filed, the impugned order has been passed by the High Court, which is being assailed before us. If the order of the Tribunal is implemented, as directed by the High Court, the Writ Petition would become infructuous. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court ought to have stayed the operation of the direction of the Tribunal.
3.  In the aforesaid premises, we set aside the impugned direction of the High Court, and request the High Court to dispose of the Writ Petition at an earlier date. The question of granting any further opportunity to the respondent at this stage, as contended by Mr. Banerjee appearing for the respondent in implementing of the Tribunal direction, does not arise. The direction of the Tribunal is stayed till final disposal of the Writ Petition.
4. Needless to mention, we express no opinion on the merits of the case.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
