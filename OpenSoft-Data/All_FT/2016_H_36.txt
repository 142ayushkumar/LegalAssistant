1. Heard the learned counsel for the appellants.
2. Leave granted.
3. Looking at the peculiar facts of the case, without issuing notice, we are disposing of these appeals. If the respondents are aggrieved by this order, it would be open to them to approach this court by filing an application.
4. In view of the fact that the State might have to suffer substantial loss, we set aside the impugned judgments whereby Regular First Appeals were dismissed on the ground of delay.
5. It is however clarified that inquiry as directed by the High Court for finding out the person, who was the cause of delay, shall continue and the High Court shall give necessary direction with regard to the same and the authorities shall take appropriate action against the irresponsible persons who caused the delay.
6. The said Regular First Appeals shall be restored to their original numbers and shall be heard on merits along with Regular First Appeal No.6064 of 2015.
6. In view of the above, the civil appeals are disposed of as allowed. No order as to costs. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
