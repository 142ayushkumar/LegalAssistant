Bhim Singh and Others v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

1 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 743/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We do not find any ground to interfere with the concurrent finding of facts. Learned counsel alternatively contended that this case can fall under Exception 4 of Section 300 IPC.
2. In this case the accused had adopted a plea of alibi and hence it is too late in the day for the accused to resort to such an exception in this special leave petition. We do not find any merit in that contention.
3.  Learned counsel made a last plea in respect of the 4th petitioner on the premise that the 4th petitioner was a juvenile when the occurrence was committed.
4.  Learned counsel fairly conceded that the question of juvenility too was raised by the 4th respondent in the form of a petition filed before the trial court and an order was passed against the petitioners on that score and that order has not been challenged till today. In other words the said order has attained finality.
5.  Hence it is not open to the petitioner to raise that contention in the present special leave petition. The SLP is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
