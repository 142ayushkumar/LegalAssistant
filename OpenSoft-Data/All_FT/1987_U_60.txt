S. Kamaljit Singh Sandhu and Others v Union Territory of Chandigarh
Supreme Court of India

20 January 1987
Transfer Petition (Criminal) No. 2 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We are satisfied that there are no sufficient grounds to transfer the case. The application for transfer is, therefore, dismissed.
2. We, however, direct the learned Special Judge to recall all the prosecution witnesses so that they may be cross-examined by the defence counsel who may be engaged by the accused persons if they desire to cross-examine those witnesses.
3. We also direct the Special Judge to arrange for the attendance of a doctor from J.L.N. Hospital, Ajmer, to be present in court every morning to examine the accused persons before the court proceedings begin. With these observations, the transfer petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
