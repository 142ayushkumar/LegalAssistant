The Order of the Court was as follows:
C.A. Nos /2001 (D10175 /2001).
Delay condoned.
Appeals are admitted.
1.  After hearing the Counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that there was a genuine mistake on the part of the appellant's Counsel in not being able to attend the proceedings before the Tribunal which resulted in anex parteorder being passed on 5th October, 1998.
2. In our view, sufficient cause has been shown and the Tribunal ought to have recalled its order and heard the case on merits after giving an opportunity to the appellant to be represented. Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, we set aside the order dated 5th October, 1998 of the Tribunal and direct that the appeals filed by the appellant shall now be decided on merits after giving an opportunity to the appellant to represent its case.
These appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms.
