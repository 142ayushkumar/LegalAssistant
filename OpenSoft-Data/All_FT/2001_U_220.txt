Narayana Shetty v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

9  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16277/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned ASG for the Union of India.
2.  The petitioner submitted his resignation in 1987 which was accepted by the concerned authorities only on 17th of December, 1993 but gave it retrospective effect from 23rd of May, 1987. The appropriate authority was not competent to accept the resignation with retrospective effect.
3. Necessarily therefore, the relationship of Master and Servant continued till 17th of December, 1993. Until that period, the petitioner would be entitled to whatever dues permissible to him under the relevant Rules. But the Petitioner having resigned from service, would not be entitled to the retiral benefits in view of the provisions contained in CCA Pension Rules, 1972.
4.  We therefore dispose of this matter by directing that the petitioner must be held to have resigned w.e.f. the date of its acceptance on 17th of December, 1993 and if he is entitled to any dues till that period, he should get the same.
Petition disposed of.
