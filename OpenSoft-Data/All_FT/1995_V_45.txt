Vishakhapatnam Urban Development Authority v V. Narayana Raju
Supreme Court of India

16 February 1995
C.A. No. ... of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  These appeals are against the High Court's order in civil revisions arising out of the applications made by the respondent under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 for appointment of an arbitrator on the ground that the civil court was not willing to act as an arbitrator and that the appellant was not agreeable to the arbitration.
2.  The claim of the respondent was admittedly above the sum of Rs. 50,000. The question is whether GOMs No. 430 dated 
24-10-1983 (Annexure A) of the paper-books contains the arbitration agreement for adjudication of claims up to Rs.50,000 by arbitration. The respondent's contention is that according to the terms of that GOMs any dispute involving a claim above Rs. 50,000 is to be adjudicated by the Judge of the court of competent jurisdiction acting as the arbitrator.
3. According to the respondent, it is GOMs No. 430 dated 24-10-1983 alone which is material for the purpose since the subsequent GOMs No. 160 dated 1-6-1987 is not mentioned in the agreement between the parties, wherein a clarification of the earlier GOMs has been made. It is on this basis that the respondent claims adjudication of his claim by arbitration in terms of GOMs No. 430 dated 24-10-1983.
4.  Having perused GOMs No. 430 dated 24-10-1983 we have no doubt that it clearly provides for arbitration in respect of claims only up to Rs. 50,000 and not above that amount, making it clear in para 2 that the claims above Rs. 50,000 are to be adjudicated by the court of competent jurisdiction. No doubt the expression "court of competent jurisdiction" is mentioned under the head "panel of arbitrators" since the same para deals with "claims up to Rs. 10,000" as well as "claims above Rs. 10,000 and up to Rs. 50,000".
5. That is however, an inartistic drafting of the GOMs but it cannot be construed to mean that claims above Rs. 50,000 are to be adjudicated by arbitration in which the Judge presiding over the court of competent jurisdiction is to act as the arbitrator. It would be absurd to make such a construction of that part of the GOMs which would oblige the Judge to act as the arbitrator. The subsequent GOMs No. 160 dated 1-6-1987 merely clarifies this fact on account of an attempt by some contractors to misconstrue the earlier GOMs as clearly stated in the subsequent GOMs. The contention of the respondent is wholly untenable.
6.  Consequently, the appeals are allowed. The impugned orders made by the High Court and the trial court are set aside resulting in rejection of the respondent's applications made under Section 8 of the Arbitration Act. No costs.
Appeals allowed.
