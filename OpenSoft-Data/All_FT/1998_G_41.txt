Dar-Us-Salam Educational Trust and Another v Government of A. P. and Others
Supreme Court of India

8  May  1998
C.As. Nos. 2630-2633 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 7010-7013 of 1998) and 2634 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 7405 of 1998) of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted in all the special leave petitions
1.  During the pendency of various writ petitions in the High Court, certain interim directions came to be made on 24-3-1998 with regard to the admissions to be made by the College. Those directions have been put in issue in these appeals
2.  The appellants had sought suspension of the proceedings of the University dated 10-6-1997 nominating two representatives of the University to serve on the Selection Committee for admissions to the appellant-College. By the impugned order, stay has been granted of operation of clauses 7 and 9 of para 2 of GOMs No. 470 dated 4-12-1997 as amended by GOMs No. 491 of 24-12-1970
3.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are not inclined to interfere with the directions given by the High Court on 24-3-1998 but clarify that admissions shall be made to the College strictly in accordance with the directions given by this Court in Shahal H. Musaliar v. State of Kerala, 1993 Indlaw SC 575. To that extent the stay order granted by the High Court shall stand amended.
4.  Learned counsel for the parties do not dispute that the direction of the University in its proceedings dated 10-6-1997, nominating two representatives to serve on the Selection Committee of the appellant-College for admission of students runs contrary to the law as settled by this Court. That direction, contained in the university proceedings dated 10-6-1997, to the extent it concerns admission of minority students, shall stay during the pendency of the writ petitions in the High Court, in modification of the interim directions of the High Court impugned herein
5.  Mr. R. F. Nariman, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants, submits that admissions shall be made in the College, both for minority students and non-minority students strictly in accordance with their merits7. With the above clarification and modification of the impugned directions dated 24-3-1998, the appeals are disposed of. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
