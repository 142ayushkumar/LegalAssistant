State of Andhra Pradesh v Kuna Satyanarayana
Supreme Court of India

14 September 1998
Cr.A. No. ... of 1998 [Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 1365 of 1998]
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard counsel for the parties. In the instant case the respondent was put to trial for offence having been committed under Section 304-B as well as Section 306 IPC in connection with the suicide of his wife. The trial court acquitted the respondent of the offence under Section 304-B but convicted him under Section 306 and sentenced him to five years' RI. In the criminal revision filed by the respondent.
2. The High Court maintained the conviction under Section 306 IPC but reduced the sentence from 5 years to 2 months.
3.  We do not find any reason, leave alone a cogent reason, contained in the High Court's order justifying the reduction of sentence from 5 years to 2 months. In fact, the reduction to two months seems like a mockery of the law. Taking all the facts and circumstances into question, in our opinion, the ends of justice will be met by imposing on the respondent a sentence of RI of 3 years plus fine of Rs 5000 (Rupees five thousand only). Ordered accordingly.
4. In default of payment of fine the respondent will undergo a further imprisonment of six months. The entire amount of fine which will be deposited will be given to the victim's father. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
