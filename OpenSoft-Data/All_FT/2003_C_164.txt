Supreme Court of India

3 April 2003
C.A. No. 3915-3919 of 2001, Dt. 3 April 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  These appeals are filed against the judgment and order dated 13-11-2000, passed in Appeal Nos.C/171/97-Bom, C/172-97-Bom, C/1007/98-Bom., C/1008/98-Bom. and C/36-V/99-Bom. by the Customs Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, West Regional Bench at Mumbai. By the impugned judgment and order the Tribunal dismissed the appeals solely on the ground that they were filed by the power of attorney holder of the appellants.
2. In our view, the said ground is wholly unjustified in view of Section 146A of the Customs Act, 1962.
3.  Therefore, these appeals are allowed and the impugned judgment and order passed by the Tribunal is set aside. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
