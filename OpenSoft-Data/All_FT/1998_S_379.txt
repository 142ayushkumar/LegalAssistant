Sanjay Musale v State of Madhya Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 September 1998
Computer Code No. 6170 of 1998 (Petition for Special Leave to Appeal Civil No. 15971/98)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Delay condoned.
1.  The write petition filed in the High Court by the petitioner concealed material facts as is noticed in the impugned order. The petitioner appears to have filed the litigation for someone. There is no public interest involved in the petition. The High Court rightly found him to be a busy body and, in our opinion, such a meddlesome interloper cannot be permitted to maintain Public Interest Litigation Petition. The courts cannot allow their forum to be misused in the garb of "public interest".
2. This special leave petition is, therefore, dismissed with Rs.5,000/- as costs.
