Umarkhadi Coor Housing Society Limited v Bhaskar Shantawan Tijore and another
Supreme Court of India

22 February 2005
C.A. No. 462 of 2002
The Order the Court was as follows:
1.  By the impugned order the High Court has restored the allotment of Flat No. 46 on the 7th floor to Respondent 1 subject to the payment of the amount due along with interest. The flat was cancelled by the appellant Cooperative Housing Society for default in making payment of a paltry amount of Rs 8097. Respondent 1 was the founding member of the appellant Society. Bulk of the payment had already been made. The dispute was about the charging of increased price which was arguable. We agree with the view taken by the High Court.
2. The High Court has done substantial justice between the parties. We decline to interfere in the matter in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution.
The civil appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
