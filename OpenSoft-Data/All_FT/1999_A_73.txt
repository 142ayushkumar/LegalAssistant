All India Lawyers Forum For Civil Liberties and Another v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 April 1999
W.P. (C) No. 125 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The State of West Bengal has filed an affidavit in which some of the causes for the infiltration of Bangladeshi inhabitants have been pointed out.
2. The learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India submits that he would verify the facts as contained in the affidavit of the State of West Bengal and seek further instructions in the matter from the Union of India.
3.  The matter of infiltration from Bangladesh and the presence of the infiltrators in certain regions in this country is a matter of serious concern. We hope that the Union of India and the States bordering Bangladesh will take effective steps to check infiltration and deport illegal infiltrators and inform the Court about those steps to prevent infiltration and to deport the illegal infiltrators. At the request of the learned counsel for the parties, the matter is adjourned by 8 weeks.
4.  We consider it appropriate to direct that notice be issued also to the States of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. Copy of the petition shall be sent along with the notice to these States and they shall be asked to file their response by the next date of hearing.
Order accordingly.
