State of Punjab and Another v Kaushalya Devi and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 January 1987
C.A. No. 1310 of 1973
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1. But for the fact that the valuation of the subject matter of the appeal exceeded Rs. 20, 000 this Court may well have refused to entertain this appeal.Since, however, a certificate on the basis of the valuation has been granted, this appeal has come up for hearing.
2. The appeal arises out of an award rendered in favour of the dependents of the victim of an accident caused by a motor vehicle belonging to the appellant-State. Learned counsel for the appellants has contended that the High Court has been unduly liberal in applying the multiplier of 27 in making computation of the dependency benefits. It appears to us that on a fair reading of the judgment of the High Court, it is possible to take the view that the High Court has not laid down as a matter of general proposition of law that a multiplier of 27 should be taken in all such cases.
3. The High Court has awarded compensation on the aforesaid footing having regard to the facts and circumstances of this particular case and it will not operate as a precedent for future. On the facts and circumstances of the present case, we do not think, we would be justified in interfering with the award passed by the High Court. The appeal is therefore dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
