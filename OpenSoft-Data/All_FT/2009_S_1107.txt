Rashmi Pal v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 January 2009
Civil Appeal No. 3330 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The writ petitions filed by the appellants questioning the legality of the action taken by the State Government to include Jat Community in the list of OBCs were disposed of by the High Court with the observation that they have already got admission in the Post-Graduate Courses and inclusion of 'Jats' in the list of OBCs by the Government will not affect their right. By now the appellants have completed Post-Graduation and, as such, the appeals have become in fructuous.
2. Therefore, we refrain from expressing any opinion on the legality or otherwise of Notification No. 334/64-I-2000-46/95 dated 10th March, 2000, issued by the Government of Uttar Pradesh under Section 13 of the Uttar Pradesh Public Services (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994.
The civil appeals are, accordingly, disposed of. No costs.
Appeal disposed of
