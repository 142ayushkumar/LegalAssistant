A.M. Shah v Pushpa Sood
Supreme Court of India

15 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12448/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1. We find no justifiable ground to interfere with the order under challenge. The limited notice issued is discharged as we are satisifed that the second floor does not contain appropriate residential accommodation.
2.  However, in the facts and circumstances of the case we grant time to the petitioner to vacate the premises before 31st May, 2002, on his furnishing a usual undertaking to that effect within four weeks from today.
Order accordingly.
