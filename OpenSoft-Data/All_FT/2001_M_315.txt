Messrs Ethiopian Airlines v Messrs Stic Travels Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2001
IA No 1 - 3 In C.A. No.4051/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  This application for direction has been made in an arbitration case pending before an Arbitral Tribunal. The agreements out of which arbitration proceedings arose are dated 5th January, 1980 and 1st July, 1987. It appears that engagement of the respondent as General Sales Agents of the appellant's airlines was terminated by the appellant w.e.f. 20th December, 1994.
2. The matter arising out of the termination of that engagement was taken up in arbitration proceedings on a suit filed under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940. The proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal commenced on 16th September, 1995. The proceedings have not yet seen the end of the day. The very purpose of arbitration by this long delay, in our opinion, is getting defeated.
3.  Mr. F. S. Nariman, learned Senior counsel appearing for the appellant submits that in case the respondent is agreeable to the appointment of a sole arbitrator, who would take up the arbitration proceedings from the stage at which the arbitral proceedings were before the Arbitral Tribunal on 3rd January, 2001, perhaps the matter can be resolved without any further delay.
4. Learned counsel for the respondent submits that he would like to seek instructions on this suggestion made by Mr. Nariman. At his request, we grant him two weeks time to get instructions. List thereafter.
Order accordingly.
