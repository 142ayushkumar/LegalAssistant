However, none of the boxes bore the box number.
15.  Accused-appellant had applied for renewal of licence from time to time and as such transaction of supply of safety fuse wire by Gopal Modi to the accused-appellant was in contravention of the provisions of Explosive Act. The accused-appellant had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators and as such the transactions.to this effect were illegal and were to aid and abet the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat had no licence to deal with gelatine or detonators but he had indulged, in such transaction pursuance to the criminal conspiracy as detailed above. He was having license to deal in gunpowder and 3 cases of safety fuses only.
16.  As regards detonators, in all 5200 special ordinary detonators and 500 electric detonators were recovered from the residence of accused-appellant and 11000 ordinary special detonators were recovered from the godown of T.C.I. Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border which was a part of the consignment booked on 14.11.1990 by the accused-appellant for transportation to Srinagar. These ordinary special detonators were manufactured by I.D.L. Chemicals Limited, Hyderabad and the remaining 500 electric detonators were manufactured by R.E.C.L., Dholpur. The batch number was not given on any of the packets of detonators. The 11000 ordinary special detonators recovered from T.C.I, godown Chikamberpur U.P. Ghaziabad border were supplied by the accused Kuldip Jain, proprietor of M/s. Bharat Explosives and Chemicals, Jaipur, to the accused-appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply company, Jaipur.
17.  Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was engaged in abetting the terrorist activities in J and k and used to procure explosives from the co-accused as preparatory acts for the terrorist activities. Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat used to take the delivery of the consignments so booked by the accused- appellant of M/s Jaipur Acid Supply Company, Jaipur, through the branch office of T.C.I, and Economic Transport Organization.
18.  According to prosecution the above facts and circumstances of the case clearly establish that the accused Mohd. Ismail Bhatt, accused-appellant, Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain have committed offences punishable under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short tha 'IPC') read with Sections 3(1), 5 and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act and Section 3(3) and 6 of TADA Act, Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni has committed offence punishable u/s. 9-B of the Act.
19.  Accused Mohd. Ismail Bhat was absconding and was declared absconder on 25.2.1994. By order of the Designated Court on 1.2.1996, the accused persons facing trial were discharged in respect of offences under Sections 3(3), 4, 6 of TADA Act and accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain were discharged in respect of offence' under Section 5 of the TADA Act. Accused Krishna Gopal Soni was discharged in respect of offence under Section 9-B of Act. Thus, the case of co-accused Khaju Lal, Mitha Lal and Kuldip Jain was transferred to the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jaipur under Section 18 of the TADA Act for trial of the offences relatable to Sections 6 and 9-B of the Act. Prosecution examined 43 witnesses to further its version. Accused appellant pleaded innocence and took a stand that he had a licence for his business, he was not present during search of his house and godowns, and gelatine and detonators were not seized from his premises. Since he had applied for renewal of his licence and there was no letter of cancellation, it is presumed that nothing illegal has been committed by him and he was falsely implicated.
20.  Learned trial Judge found the accused guilty for offences punishable under Section 5 of the TADA Act, Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Act and Section 9-B of the Act, after considering the evidence. He was sentenced to undergo five years imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 with default stipulation in relation to Section 5 of the TADA Act, Similar custodial sentence was imposed for the offence under the Explosive Act and the Act and a fine of Rs. 5,000 for the offence under the Explosive Act and Rs. 3,000 under the Act default stipulation.
The conviction was based on following incriminating circumstances:
(1) Recovery of gelatine and detonators from the room above the godown;
(2) Sale of articles to absconding accused which were seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border when being taken back to Jaipur. The articles were kept in the godown of the two accused who were facing trial separately and
(3) The confessional statement was recorded before the Superintendent of Police strictly in accordance with law, and that was sufficient for finding the accused guilty with the aforesaid findings, the conclusions of guilt and award of sentence were done.
21.  In support of the appeal, it was submitted that conscious possession which is sine qua non for establishing the accusations has not been proved. It was clear from the evidence that the room from where the contraband articles were seized was easily accessible. Even the witnesses have not consistently said that the room and the almirah from where the articles were allegedly kept were not locked. The Explosives Controller's report is not very clear. There is also no material to show where the articles were kept during the date of seizure and the date of report. Some of the witnesses have not specifically said about seizure of the articles. Section 5 refers to possession "in present". Even if it is held that at some point of time possession was there, and same was pursuant to any conspiracy, that cannot stick to the appellant as there was no charge under Section 120B of the IPC. The confessional statement was recorded without granting proper time for reflection.
22. It is also submitted that the appellant is nearly 80 years of age and since accusations under the TADA Act have not been conclusively established and the appellant had already undergone custody for about 4 years, the sentence may be reduced to the period already undergone in case it is held that the accusations have been established.
23.  Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the stand taken about conscious possession is clearly untenable because the room was part of the premises owned by the accused. There was not even any suggestion that somebody else had planted the articles. On the contrary, the suggestion was that one Chitarmal had kept the articles for safe custody. The confessional statement suffers from no legal infirmity and all requisite procedural safeguards have been taken. It is not the date of discovery which is relevant, and earlier possession subsequent to the date of notification is material. Merely because there has been a detection subsequently, it does not take away the rigor of Section 5. So far as the articles seized at the U.P. Ghaziabad border is concerned, a camouflage was made to take out the articles as if they are harmless chemicals. Appellant himself had admitted that he was previously having a licence to deal with explosives, but the licence was subsequently not renewed. Whether the almirah was locked or whether the room was locked or open does not make any difference when possession has been established.
We shall first deal with the question relating to conscious possession.
24.  Whether there was conscious possession has to be determined with reference to the factual backdrop. The facts which can be culled out from the evidence on record is that the accused was owner of the premises. It has not even been remotely suggested that somebody else kept the articles, without his knowledge.
25. It is highlighted that unless the possession was coupled with requisite mental element, i.e. conscious possession and not mere custody without awareness of the nature of such possession, Section 5 is not- attracted.
26.  The expression 'possession' is polymorphous term which assumes .different colours in different contexts. It may carry different meanings in contextually different backgrounds. It is impossible, as was observed in Superintendent & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunia and Ors., AIR (1980) SC 52 1979 Indlaw SC 548, to work out a completely logical and precise definition of "Possession" uniformly applicable to all situations in the context of all statutes.
27. The word 'conscious means awareness about a particular fact. It is a state of mind which is deliberate or intended.
28.  As noted in Gunwantlal v. The State of M.P., AIR (1972) SC 1756 1972 Indlaw SC 558 possession in a given case need not be physical possession but can be constructive, having power and control over the article in case in question, while the person whom physical possession is given holds it subject to that power or control.
29. The word 'possession' means the legal right to possession (See Health v. Drown, [1972] 2 All Er 561 (HL):[1972] 2 W.L.R. 1306. In an interesting case it was observed that where a person keeps his firearm in his mother's flat which is safer than his own home, he must be considered to be in possession of the same. See Sullivan v. Earl of Caithness, [1976] 1 All ER 844 (QBD):[1976] 2 W.L.R. 361.
30.  Once possession is established the person who claims that it was not a conscious possession has to establish it, because how he came to be in possession is within his special knowledge.
31.  The factual scenario noticed by the trial Court is based on the evidence of PWs 2 and 5. The evidence of the Explosive Controller and the analysis made by him has been established. The Explosive Controller's report shows that the seals were intact. In fact the suggestion given by the defence was that the goods were kept for safe custody by one Chitarmal. It strengthens the prosecution version rather than weakening it. Samples (Ext. 25) draw on 19.11.1990. It was found out that the articles were gelatine, electric detonator and detonator. There was an attempt to erase the seals of the manufacturer on the seized containers. The Explosive Controller has indicated about the seals to be intact. In State of Tamil Nadu v. Sivarasan @ Raghu @ Sivarasa and Ors., [1997] 1 SCC 682 1996 Indlaw SC 1833 it was held that the prosecution must prove that the accused was in conscious possession unauthorisedly in a notified area of any specified arms and ammunition. The large quantities of the explosives and other contraband articles not only belies but militates against the very plea of the appellant relating to conscious possession.
32. No further nexus with any terrorist or disruptive activity is required to be proved as a statutory presumption would arise that the said arm or explosive substance was meant to be used for a terrorist or disruptive act. Statements of Ramniwas (PW-7), Nand Singh (PW-5), Prabhu (PW-6) has been analysed in great detail. The Explosive Controller, Dr. S. Kamal was examined as PW-8. As rightly noticed by the trial Court in spite of lengthy cross examination, no crack has been noticed in their statements to discredit their testimony.
33.  It has been noticed by the trial Court that there was only one entrance towards the concerned room which was above the godown at the back of the house. It was not an open place as contended to which any one, without getting into the house itself, can gain entry. In Sivarasan's case 1996 Indlaw SC 1833 (supra) it was observed that gelatine goods were explosive substance within the meaning of Section 5 of the TADA Act. Since it is a complete article or device capable of exploding, ordinary detonator and electric detonators are also complete explosive substances within the purview of Section 5 of the TADA Act.
34. Additionally, the ordinary detonator and electric detonator in huge quantity were seized. The possession of these articles in such large quantity by the accused has been proved and there is nothing to discard the prosecution version that the possession was conscious. Additionally, the confessional statement recorded by PW-4 does not suffer from any infirmity.
35. Though it is desirable that sufficient time gap should be given to the declarant, in addition, to telling him that the statement could be used in law against him, there is no rigid formula as to what would be an adequate time. It would depend upon the circumstances of each case. On the facts of the present case, the time though was not very long, yet cannot be said to be too short to cast doubt on the voluntariness of the statement. At no point of time there was any challenge made that the statement which was produced in the Court in presence of the accused was not voluntary and/or was the result of coercion or undue influence or threat.
36. In fact there was no denial of the fact that the statement was recorded. It has not been shown as to in what manner the accused has been prejudiced by non-granting of longer time. The statement recorded is very elaborate and the accused has inculpated himself with the details like the source of purchase of the articles which were within his personal and special knowledge. There is no reason to discard the evidence of PW-4, and The confessional statement.
37.  In S.N. Dube v. N.B. Bhoir and Ors., [2000] 2 SCC 254 2000 Indlaw SC 560 it was held that neither Section 15 of the TADA Act nor rule 15 contemplates recording of confessional statement in two parts or giving time to the person making a confession to think over and re-consider whether he still wants to make the statement inspite of being told that he is not bound to make it and that it can be used against him. The ratio of this decision has full application to the facts of the present case. In view of these findings, it is not necessary to go into the other question whether the past transactions come within the umbrella of Section 5, though prima facie that appears to be the correct position. That being the position, the appeal is without merit and deserves dismissal, which we direct.
Appeal dismissed
