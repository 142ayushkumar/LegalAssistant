1. Heard the learned counsel.
2. Leave granted.
3. We are impressed by only one submission made by the learned counsel for the appellant that the trial court did not consider the provisions of the amended Section 83 of the Wakf Act, 1995, while relying upon the judgment delivered in Faseela M. Vs. Munnerul Islam Madrasa Committee & Anr. [AIR 2014 SC 2064 = 2014 SCR 613 2014 Indlaw SC 268]. The said judgment pertains to a case filed prior to the amendment of Section 83 of the Wakf Act, 1995.
4. In the circumstances, in our opinion, it would be just and appropriate to remit the matter to the trial court to consider the provisions of Section 83 of the Wakf Act, 1995 and take appropriate decision in accordance with law.
5. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court whereby the order of the trial court has been confirmed.
6. The appeal is allowed with the above observations, with no order as to costs.
7. The parties shall appear before the trial court on 26th October, 2015, so that the matter can be heard further by the trial court. Intimation of this order be sent to the trial court.
Appeal allowed
