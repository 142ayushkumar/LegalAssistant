K. K. Sharma v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3052/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere in this matter as in our view a deputationist cannot claim permanent absorption in the organisation to which he had deputed as a matter of right and the lending authority always have the right to take back the deputationist on repatriation.
2.  Mr. P.P. Rao learned senior counsel however stated that, the organisation to which he belongs, the scheme of voluntary retirement has been introlduced and therefore he ought to have been allowed atleast three months' time for completion of the minimum period to exercise his right of voluntary retirement. We do not know whether he is going to be retrenched on being repatriated or is going to be permitted to continue under the spinning federation.
3. In the circumstances, while we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order we hope that the spinning federation will not immediately terminate his services on being repatriated and will atleast permit him to continue for three months so that he will be able to exercise his right to voluntary retirement.
The special leave petition is dismissed accordingly.
Petition dismissed.
