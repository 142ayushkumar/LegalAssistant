I.A.No.3 IN Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4697/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This Interlocutory Application has been filed by the respondent in the Special Leave Petition seeking modification of the orders of this Court passed on 07.05.1999, 10.09.1999 and 16.09.1999 and permission for Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lokeshwar Prasad to conduct the arbitration proceedings in terms of order dated 09.12.98 passed by this Court.
2.  On 07.05.99 this Court disposed of the Special Leave Petition giving option to the applicant to appoint one of the arbitrators from the panel submitted by Union of India and recording the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the Union of India will appoint an arbitrator of their own.
3. From the panel of three names, the applicant has opted for appointment of Mr. L.M. Sahore, CEDE/Northern Railway/New Delhi as its arbitrator. The Union of India, it is brought to our notice by the learned counsel, has already appointed Mr. Sukhbir Singh, CEDE/CCG, Western Railway, Mumbai.
In view of this position, now the panel of the arbitrators presided over by Mr. Justice Lokeshwar Prasad will conduct and complete the arbitration proceedings in accordance with law.
Having regard to the long history of the dispute we hope that the panel of arbitrator will decide the dispute expeditiously.
Order accordingly.
