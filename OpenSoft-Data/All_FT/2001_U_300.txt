Union of India v S.S. Construction
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18476/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  An award was made on certain disputes arising between the parties and referred to arbitration. The award referred to various points in dispute and the evidence on record as well as to the provisions of law before arriving at the conclusion. The award made by the arbitrator was objected to by the applications filed under Section 30 and 33 of the Arbitration Act and the objections having been overruled by the High Court an appeal was filed unsuccessfully. Hence this appeal by way of Special leave.
2. Having gone through the award and the orders made by the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench, we think that the various contentions urged on behalf of the parties have not been duly considered by the High Court.
3.  Therefore, the orders made by the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench in regard to this proceeding shall stand set aside and the matter shall stand remitted to the learned Single Judge for fresh consideration on merits in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made by us. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
4. In the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
