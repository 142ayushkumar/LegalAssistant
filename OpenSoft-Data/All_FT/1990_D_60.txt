Dr (Mrs) Leena Roy v Dr Subrato Roy and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 October 1990
W.P. (Criminal) No. 846 of 1990 (Along with Cr. M.P. Nos. 2876, 4145 of 1990, S.L.P. No. 10065 and I.A. No. 3 of 1990)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We have considered the entire matter. The parties are present before us and have filed an application for compromise and also for an order for decree of divorce by mutual consent. Since we are not in seisin of the matter it is better to direct the parties to file the application before the City Civil and Sessions Court, Calcutta. If such an application is filed, the Court will dispose of the application as expeditiously as possible preferably within two weeks from the date of filing of such application, in view of the fact that one of the parties intends to go back to America in connection with her service.
2. Regarding the custody of the child in view of the compromise being effected between the parties we direct the writ, applications and the special leave petition to be disposed of in terms of the compromise. There will be no order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
