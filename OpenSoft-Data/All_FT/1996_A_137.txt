Anil Starch Products Limited v Collector of Central Excise
Supreme Court of India

10 October 1996
C.A. No. 523 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. It is apparent from the judgment of the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal that the product in question, Wet Dextrose, is an intermediate used in the manufacture of the final product Sorbitol. It is not marketable as such.
2. Accordingly, as the law now stands, it is not excisable. We find that recently a civil appeal (CA No. 942 of 1988) upon the same point was not admitted.
3.The appeal is allowed and the judgment and order under appeal is set aside
No order as costs.
Apeal allowed.
