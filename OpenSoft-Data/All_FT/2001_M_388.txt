Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.)......./2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay in refiling the petition is condoned.
1.  The Chief Judicial Magistrate is shown as the first petitioner in this special leave petition.
2.  Learned counsel submitted that he may be deleted from the party array as he cannot possibly be a petitioner in this case.
3. Even that apart, we have noted that the impugned order is dated 28.2.2000 which stayed the proceedings for a period of 3 months from that date. It means that order has become lapsed by the end of the three months period.
4.  Learned counsel is not aware as to what happened after the said period of three months. We dismiss this special leave petition without prejudice.
Petition dismissed.
