V.K. Mahajan v Punjab State Warehousing Corporation and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20034/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The action taken by the Executive Committee of respondent No.1- Corporation in relation to the order of absorption of respondent No. 5 was rescinded by the Managing Director inasmuch as the Board of Directors had not approved such absorption.
2.  The question raised before the High Court was whether it was permissible for the Executive Committee or the Board of Directors to take such an action. When the matter itself was in dispute, it was not for the first respondent to have decided such a matter. The High Court should have decided as to which of the authority is competent to decide the matter and thereafter should have given its finding. The High Court without adopting this course has proceeded to ask the first respondent to decide the matter.
3. Therefore, we think that the order made by the High Court is erroneous and is set aside. The matter is remitted and the writ petition is restored to the file of the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance with law.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
