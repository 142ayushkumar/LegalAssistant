State of Uttar Pradesh v Hasan Ali Alias Chhannan and others
Supreme Court of India

4 March 2005
Cr.A. No. 380 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 4278 of 2004)
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard the parties.
Leave granted.
1.  The respondents were convicted by the trial court under Sections 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code (for short IPC) besides other sections and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life. On appeal being preferred, the High Court upheld convictions of the respondents for other offences whereas their conviction under Sections 302/149 IPC has been converted into Sections 304 Part 11/149 IPC and each of them has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years. Hence this appeal by special leave filed on behalf of the State of U.P.
2.  From a bare perusal of the judgment of the High Court, it appears that the only ground which weighed with the High Court for converting the conviction under Sections 302/149 IPC into Sections 304 Part 11/149 was that the parties were close neighbours and they are of the same family. In our view this could not have been a ground for converting the conviction into Sections 304 Part 11/149 IPC. The victim received as many as ten injuries on different parts of the body and out of the same two injuries were on the head. The accused were armed with dangerous weapons and they inflicted injuries thereby. It is opined that the injuries were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.
3. In view of these facts, we are of the view that the High Court has committed an error in converting the conviction of the respondents from Sections 302/149 IPC into Sections 304 Part 11/149 IPC. In our view, the trial court was quite justified in convicting the respondents under Sections 302/149 IPC.
4.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the impugned order rendered by the High Court converting the conviction of the respondents from Sections 302/149 IPC into Sections 304 Part 11/149 IPC is set aside and conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court against the respondents under Sections 302/149 IPC are restored.
Appeal allowed.
