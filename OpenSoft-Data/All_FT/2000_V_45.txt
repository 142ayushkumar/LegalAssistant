C.A. No. 9283 of 1995
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  There has been so gross a breach of principles of natural justice in this case that the High Court 1994 Indlaw ALL 151 was right in setting aside the order on that count and not giving consideration to remitting the matter.
The civil appeal is dismissed with costs.
2.  The amount kept by the Revenue in a fixed deposit in a national bank may now be withdrawn by them.
Appeal dismissed.
