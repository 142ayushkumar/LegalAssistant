1.  By order dated 12-12-2007 made in C.A. No. 5845/2007 arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 6654/2007, this Court has held that an important substantial question of law arises for determination, namely, whether freight paid by the assessee (AOP) to truck owners who in turn are members of the said AOP is subject to TDS under section 194C(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
