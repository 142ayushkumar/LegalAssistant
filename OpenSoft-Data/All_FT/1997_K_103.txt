The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  One of the questions that falls for consideration in these appeals is whether the provisions of S. 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 can be held to be applicable where a rule in the Central Excise Rules is replaced. By notification dated 6-8-1977 issued by the Central Government in exercise of its rule-making power, Rules 10 and G-A were substituted.
The said Rules as substituted in 1977 were replaced in 1980 by Section 11-A of the Central Excise Act
2.  Shri F. S. Nariman, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants in Civil Appeal No. 2132 of 1994, has placed reliance on the decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Rayala Corpn.
