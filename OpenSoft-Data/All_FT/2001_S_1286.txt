Tej Pal v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

20 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 742/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  At the outset, the learned counsel for the appellant drew our attention to the order dated 6th of December 2000 in Criminal Appeal No.1090 of 2000 - Bachhu Singh Surendra Babu & Ors. vs. State of U.P. and submitted that this appeal may be disposed of by passing similar order. By the order dated 6th of December 2000, this Court allowed the Criminal Appeal No.9020 of 2000 which was filed by co-accused. Taking note of the compromise entered between the parties, this Court modified the order passed by the High Court by confining the substantial sentence to the period of imprisonment already undergone.
2.  This appeal filed by accused Tejpal is directed against the judgment which was under challenge in the afore mentioned appeal. The compromise arrived at between the parties also covers the case of the appellant. In the circumstances, we are inclined to accept the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant. This appeal should, therefore, be disposed of by passing similar order as in the above mentioned decided case.
3. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. Order of the High Court imposing the sentence is modified and the appellant is sentenced to undergo imprisonment for the period already undergone which is stated to be from 15th September 2000 till date. The appellant shall be released forthwith, if his detention is not required in any other case.
Appeal allowed.
