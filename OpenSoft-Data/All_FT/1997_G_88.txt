Collector of Central Excise v Gum Products (P) Ltd.
Supreme Court of India

12 March 1997
C.A. No. 110 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The respondent company manufactures coated chewing gum, bubble gum etc. While chewing gum is specifically covered under Item 1-A of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, bubble gum does not find a mention in that entry. The question then is whether bubble gum can be classified under Entry 1-A or under the residuary Entry 68 of the said Schedule.
2.  The Tribunal has taken the view that bubble gum, not having been included in Item 1-A, would fall under Item 68 of the Schedule, more so because it is commercially a distinct item. The Revenue contended that bubble gum was a gum-like chewing gum and would, therefore, fall within Item 1-A(1) of the Schedule. This contention was negatived by the Tribunal firstly because it is not included in Item 1-A(1) and is commercially known as a different item altogether and is not the same thing as chewing gum.
3.  We see no reason why we should take a different view as the view taken by the Tribunal is a plausible view.
4. We, therefore, do not see any substance in this appeal filed by the Revenue and dismiss the same with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
