3. 330thly, that you accused 78 between November 1971 and November 1973, at the said place, in furtherance of the said agreement and conspiracy and in the course of the same transaction abetted accused 1 to 74 corrupt or illegal means or otherwise abusing their official position as public servants to obtain pecuniary advantage for yourselves and others to the tune of Rs. 6, 35, 855.25 as set out in the annexure to charge 326 supra and that you thereby committed an offence u/s. 5(2) read with 5(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Central Act II) 1947 read with 109 Indian Penal Code and within my cognizance.
4. 331stly, that you accused 78 between August 1972 August 1973 Madras in furtherance of the said agreement and conspiracy and in the course of the same transaction habitually accepted or obtained from approver Kannappan for yourself gratification (other than the legal remuneration as a motive or reward as mentioned in S. 161 of the Indian Penal Code ) at the rate of Rs. 2000 per month from August, 1972 to August, 1973 and in all making Rs. 26, 000 and that you thereby committed an offence punishable u/s. 5(2) read with 5(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Central Act II) 1947 and within my cognizance."
2. He approached the High Court under Section 482, Code of Criminal Procedure praying that the last two charges framed against him be quashed on the ground that he is not a public servant within the meaning of S. 21 of the Penal Code.
No evidence in respect of any of these charges has so far been recorded. The High Court has dismissed the petition holding that the appellant is a public servant within the contemplation of Cl. 12(b) of S. 21 of the Penal Code.
3. Hence this appeal.
4. We have party heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties. The learned Advocate-General has contended that clause 10th of S. 21 of the Penal Code will also cover the case. The argument is that as a member of the Taxing Committee, the appellant was concerned with expenditure and preparation of budget and sponsoring proposals of financial character.
It is submitted that evidence will be led to establish facts showing that the appellant is a public servant within the meaning of S. 21 of the Code and decision of this question at this stage when no evidence has at all been recorded, would be purely hypothetical and divorced from facts. We also feel that the question involved is a mixed question of law and fact. It requires evidence for its determination. We therefore think that the High Court was in error in deciding this question purely in the abstract without there being any evidence before it.
5. On this preliminary ground we would allow this appeal, set aside the decision of the High Court and sent the case back to the trial Court for further proceedings in accordance with law on all the charges framed by the trial Court against the appellant. We make it clear that the question as to whether the appellant is or is not a public servant, is left open to be decided at the appropriate stage. The case being old, the trial Court is directed to dispose it off with utmost expedition by undertaking proceedings preferably from day to day.
Appeal allowed.
