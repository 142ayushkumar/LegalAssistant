State of Gujarat and Others v Messrs Prabhat Solvent Extraction Industries Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

22 September 1980
Review Petitions Nos. 164-169 of 1979.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard counsel for the parties. It appears that at the time when we dismissed the special leave petitions, our attention was not drawn to the fact that in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 3438 leave had already been granted where identical point was involved. Civil appeal No. 46(N) of 1975 is ready for hearing and if we do not allow the review petitions, the result will be that there will be possibility of two contradictory judgments coming into existence. In view of these circumstances, therefore, we allow the review petitions subject to the payment of one set of cost of Rs. 2000 to the respondents. The order dismissing the special leave petitions is set aside and all the special leave petitions are granted subject to usual conditions but the cost of the appeals arising out of the special leave will be borne by the appellants in any event.
2. As regards stay, there will be stay of the operation of the judgment under appeal provided that the appellants shall refund the amount if the fail in the appeals with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum within a month from the pronouncement of the judgment. Let these appeals be heard along with Civil Appeal No. 46 of 1975. Printing of appeal record and statements of case dispensed with. Appeals to be heard on S. L. P. Paper-books with additional documents to be filed by the parties within a month. Liberty to mention.
Appeal allowed.
