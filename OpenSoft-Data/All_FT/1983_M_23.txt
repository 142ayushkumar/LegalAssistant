Management of Metal Box of India Limited v Presiding Officer, Additional Labour Court, Madras and Another
Supreme Court of India

3 January 1983
C.A. No. 18(NL) of 1983,
The Judgment was delivered by: V.D. Tulzapurkar, J. and  V. Balakrishna Eradi, J.
Leave granted.
After hearing counsel we are satisfied that it will be futile in this case to retain the order of reinstatement or respondent No. 2 since it is agreed that his superannuation date is 31st January, 1983. We accordingly modify the Award by deleting the portion of the Award in regard to such reinstatement.
1. Respondent No. 2 will be paid all the back wages and other benefits which he is entitled to in law upto the said date of retirement and the same will be worked out by the Principal Labour Court, Madras before whom C.P. No. 126/80 is pending.
The amount of Rs. 94,000/- which has been deposited in this Court will be permitted to be withdrawn by respondent No. 2 on account and be credited towards the satisfaction of the aforesaid dues.
Order accordingly.
