Bhupatrai Maganlal Joshi and others v Union of India and another
Supreme Court of India

9 July 1996
Appeal (Civil) 384 of 1973
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. The question before the High Court was whether the reservation of land for exploitation of mineral resources in the public sector was permissible under the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 read with the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. Relying upon an earlier Division Bench judgment, the High Court answered the question in the affirmative and dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant.
We have gone through the judgment relied upon by the High Court and find no ground to interfere. We agree with the reasoning and the conclusions reached in the said judgment.
2. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
3. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
