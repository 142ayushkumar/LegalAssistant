C.B.I v Hakim Singh
Supreme Court of India

13 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2270/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The impugned judgment does not indicate that the High Court has considered all the parameters required under Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act'). Such are necessary for granting bail to a convicted person for the offence under the said Act vide, Union of India vs. Ram Samujh and Another, Supdt.Narcotics Control Bureau vs. R. Paulsamy and Babua Tazmul Hossain vs. The State of Orissa.
2.  Learned counsel for the respondent find it very difficult to defend the impugned judgment in view of the above decisions. He then pleaded that respondent may be given an opportunity to address arguments before the High Court on various aspects by which he is entitled to get bail. We accede to such request.
3.  In the result we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order. The High Court will now consider the bail application afresh and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law.
Appeal allowed.
