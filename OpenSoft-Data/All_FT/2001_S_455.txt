B. Manivannan v State By Cbi, Madras
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2455/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  From the affidavit filed by the Superintendent of Police, Central Bureau of Investigation, it is crystal clear that the assertions made by Mr. B. Manivannan with regard to the service of affidavit and refusal by the CBI to accept the same, prima-facie appears to be incorrect.
2.  We would therefore call upon Shri B. Manivannan to appear and show cause as to why he shall not be appropriately dealt with for filing a frivolous affidavit in the Court.
3. He must indicate in his show cause as to who was the concerned officer to whom he offered the notice in question and if he was not the appropriate officer, why did he made the vague assertion in Court.
He must appear in person in this Court on 16.01.2002 and file an affidavit.
4. Further appearance of the Director, C.B.I. is dispensed with.
Order accordingly.
