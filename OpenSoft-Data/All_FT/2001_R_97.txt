Rajasthan State Bridge Cons. Corporation Limited v Hanuman Sahai Sharma and Anr
Supreme Court of India

3 April 2001
C.A..No.7358/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the interim order which was passed by the Single Judge and upheld by the Divison Bench, was not entirely correct. Either the Single Judge should have declined to grant stay or if stay was granted an order could have been passed in terms of Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act. It could not have been directed that if the Labour Court's order is not complied with, then the petition will stand automatically dismissed.
2. We, accordingly, set aside the later part of the order of the Single Judge and remand the case back to the Single Judge who will decide the stay application on merits. We further request the High Court to dispose of the main writ petition within six months.
The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.
Appeal disposed of.
