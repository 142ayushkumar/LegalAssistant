Gayadeen v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

20 February 2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  This SLP has been filed challenging the Judgment of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh passed on 11.8.1999 in Crl.Appeal No.794 of 1989. As per the impugned judgment the High Court confirmed the conviction passed on the petitioner under Section 302 of IPC and sentence of imprisonment for life. Inspite of the long interval elpased since the passing of the impugned order, petitioner did not think it necessary to surrender to his  bail. Even today the counsel submitted that he has no instructions whether the petitioner has surrendered or not.
2. We therefore dismiss this SLP. We direct the 1st Addl.Sessions Judge, Chattarpur, Madhya Pradesh to take immediate steps to get this petitioner into custody to be put back in jail for undergoing the sentence imposed on him.
3.  The said Sessions Judge shall report to this Court through the Registrar of the High Court of M.P. as to what has happened in response to this direction.
Petition dismissed.
