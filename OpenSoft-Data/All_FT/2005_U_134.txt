Central Bank Retirees' Assn. and others v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

1 September 2005
W.P. (C) No. 471 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We are of the considered view that this is not a fit case to entertain the petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. The proper course for the petitioners would be to move the High Court. To avoid unnecessary delay, we send the writ petition filed in this Court to the Delhi High Court to be registered as petition under Article 226 of the Constitution.
2. Since the dispute relates to claim of pension, it would be proper if the matter is taken up for early disposal. We request the High Court to dispose of the matter as early as possible, preferably within twelve months from today.
The writ petition is dismissed with the aforesaid observation.
Petition dismissed.
