F.C.I., Bombay and Others v Transport and Dock Workers Union and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 August 1999
C.As. Nos. 5798-99 of 1998 with S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 12657-58 of 1998, 16122-31 of 1998
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  In this bunch of petitions one of the questions argued before us by the learned counsel for the parties relates to the definition of "appropriate Government" set out in S. 2(1)(a) of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970. While it is maintained by the petitioners that the appropriate Government would be the Central Government, the respondents contend that the State Government and not the Central Government would be the appropriate Government. Reference is also made to the definition of 64 appropriate Government
"set out in S. 2(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
This question has been considered by this Court in a number of decisions. While considering the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, a three-Judge Bench in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. v. Workmen 1975 Indlaw SC 1641975 Indlaw SC 164 held that the appropriate Government would be the State Government even though the Company was wholly owned and controlled by the Central Government.
A two-Judge Bench in  Heavy Engg. Mazdoor Union v. State of Bihar 1969 Indlaw SC 343  also took the same view which was followed in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.1975 Indlaw SC 1641975 Indlaw SC 164  and Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh v. Model Mills 1985 Indlaw SC 1651985 Indlaw SC 165 as also in Workers' Union v. Food Corpn. of India 1985 Indlaw SC 1651985 Indlaw SC 165.
The question was again considered by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Air India Statutory Corpn. v. United Labour Union 1996 Indlaw SC 16701996 Indlaw SC 1670.
In the decision it is stated as under : "
2. In Food Corpn. of India case 1985 Indlaw SC 1651985 Indlaw SC 165 the Bench proceeded primarily on the premise that warehouses of the Corporation are situated within the jurisdiction of different State Governments which led it to conclude that the appropriate Government would be the State Government."
3.  On a perusal of the above para it would be clear that although the cases, namely, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. 1975 Indlaw SC 1641975 Indlaw SC 164, R. D. Shetty.  Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India, 1979 Indlaw SC 16  and Food Corpn. of India 1985 Indlaw SC 1651985 Indlaw SC 165mentioned above were decided by a three-Judge Bench, the Hon'ble Judges who constituted the three-Judge Bench in Air India Statutory Corpn. case 1996 Indlaw SC 16701996 Indlaw SC 1670 did not agree with the view already expressed earlier that the appropriate Government would be the State Government and thus there is an obvious conflict of opinion on this question which needs to be resolved.
4.  The other question canvassed before us, namely, the question of automatic absorption of contract labour as a consequence of a notification issued u/s. 10 of the Act is also an important question.
5.  Having regard to the conflict of opinion as also the importance of the question raised before us, we direct that this case shall be laid before a larger Bench for hearing. Let the papers be laid before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate orders.
Order accordingly.
