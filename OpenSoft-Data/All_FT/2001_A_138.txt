Allarakha Dery Babarbhai Malekh and Anr v State of Gujarat and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3441/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The accused assails the order of the High Court cancelling bail granted by the learned Sessions Judge in exercise of power under section 439(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code. It is contended by the counsel appearing for the accused that the High Court has not borne in mind different considerations while exercising power under section 439(5) of the Code, and mechanically cancelled the bail only on considering the gravity of the offence.
2.  The learned counsel appearing for the State, on the other hand, contended that there has been a threat perception from the accused after being released on bail, and on a complaint being filed to the effect that the matter is still pending consideration before the Magistrate, we are not inclined to take that into consideration inasmuch as the High Court never took that into account while cancelling the bail.
3. In that view of the matter, the impugned order cancelling the bail merely on considering the gravity of the offence cannot be sustained.
4.  We therefore set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court in exercise of power under section 439(5). We, however, make it clear that it will be open for the High Court or any other appropriate Court to take into account any subsequent event, if an application for cancellation is filed.
The appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
