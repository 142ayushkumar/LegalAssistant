Mona v Ramandeep Aggarwal
Supreme Court of India

14 February 2005
Transfer Petition (C) No. 460 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Petition admitted.
1.  On the facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to transfer the matrimonial petition from Delhi. Taking into consideration the convenience of the parties and the apprehension entertained by the husband instead of transferring it to Ambala as prayed for by the petitioner, we think it appropriate to transfer the case to Kurukshetra, Haryana.
2. Therefore, we direct HMAQ Case No.643 of 2003, titled Ramandeep Aggarwal v. Mona from the Court of District and Sessions Judge, Tis Hazari, Delhi to the Court of Principal District Judge, Kurukshetra, Haryana who will try the case himself or transfer it to the court of competent jurisdiction for disposal in accordance with law.
The transfer petition is allowed.
Petition allowed.
