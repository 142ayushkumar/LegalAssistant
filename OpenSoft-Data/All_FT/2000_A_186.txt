Gayatri Mohapatra v Ashit Kumar Panda
Supreme Court of India

6 November 2000
Transfer Petition (Civil) No. 273 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner is the wife of the respondent. The respondent filed Original Petition No. 260 of 2000 titled Ashit Kumar Panda v. Gayatri Devi against her, which is pending before the Family Court at Meerut. She seeks transfer of this petition to the Family Court at Cuttack. Orissa.
2.  The transfer is sought on the ground that she is a lady belonging to the weaker section of the society and it will be difficult for her to travel to Meerut and attend the hearing of the case from time to time. There being no male member in the family and the parents being old and not keeping good health, they will not be able to accompany her.
3. In the counter-affidavit filed by the respondent, it is stated that the petitioner has personal houses in Delhi. She is a Director in a company run by her mother, which has its branch office in Delhi. She regularly visits Delhi for official and personal work. It is added, the petitioner travels throughout the country in connection with the company work and that she also travels most of the time with her father who has retired from the post of DGP, Orissa.
4.  In the reply to the said counter the petitioner, inter alia, states that the petitioner has never travelled alone throughout the country in connection with the family business.
5.  From the above allegations and counter-allegations, it is clear that the petitioner has travelled from one place to another and the ground that she will not be able to travel, cannot be a valid ground to seek transfer of the case.
We, therefore, dismiss the transfer petition. No costs.
Petition dismissed.
