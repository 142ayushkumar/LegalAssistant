Citizens Welfare Society v State of Andhra Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18198/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  From the impugned order it appears that the construction of flyover is almost over and the High Court therefore was not inclined to entertain the petition filed before it.
2.  Mr. Gururaja Rao, the learned counsel, states that the aforesaid assumption of the High Court is incorrect and he further states that the earlier judgment does not cover the field. In this view of the matter, it would be more appropriate to move the concerned High Court for review of its earlier order.
3. Mr. Gururaja Rao says that he seeks to withdraw this special leave petition so as to file an application before the High Court.
It is accordingly dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
