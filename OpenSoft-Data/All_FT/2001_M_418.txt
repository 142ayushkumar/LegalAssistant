Kabool Chand v Mishri Lal
Supreme Court of India

27 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10620/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard counsel for the petitioner. We do not find any merit in this petition. The special leave petition is dismissed.
2.  Learned counsel for the petitioner then urged that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises in question immediately, he would be put to great hardship and for that reason the petitioner may be granted some time to vacate the premises. The request appears to be reasonable.
3. We, accordingly, direct that the petitioner shall not be dispossessed from the premises in dispute till 31st January, 2002 subject to filing a usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks' from today.
4.  In case the respondent has any grievance to this part of our order, it shall be open to him to apply for vacation of the same.
Petition dismissed.
