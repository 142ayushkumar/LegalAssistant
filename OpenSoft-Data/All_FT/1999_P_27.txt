The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question is whether there is an act of manufacture when a job worker prints a name on a film which is then utilised for the purposes of packaging.

Glass Industries Ltd. & Ors. 1997 Indlaw SC 1185 = 1997 Indlaw SC 1185 (SC)], where it has been held that printing upon a bottle is not a process of manufacture. No order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
