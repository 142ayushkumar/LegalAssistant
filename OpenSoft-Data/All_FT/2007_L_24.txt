Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai v Laljee Godhoo and Company
Supreme Court of India

21 August 2007
C.A. Nos. 1315-1316 of 2002 withC.A.Nos. 5040-5045, 4961 of 2002 and 6553-6554 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The short question which arises for determination in this civil appeal filed by the Department is whether the process to which the raw asafoetida (hing) is subjected to, resulting in the formation of "compounded asafoetida", constitutes "manufacture" under the Central Excise Act, 1944. We have gone through the process. As rightly held by the Tribunal there is no chemical change brought about by the aforestated process. The product at the starting point of the process and the product at the terminal point of the process remains the same.
2. In the circumstances the Tribunal was right in holding that the essential character of the product remains constant and, therefore, there is no manufacture. The twin tests applicable for making the goods excisable is manufacture and marketability. The first test in the present case is not satisfied. There is no "manufacture" involved in the process.
3.  Therefore, the Tribunal was right in holding that the "compounded asafoetida" were not exigible to excise duty. For the aforestated reason there is no merit in these appeals. The civil appeals stand dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
