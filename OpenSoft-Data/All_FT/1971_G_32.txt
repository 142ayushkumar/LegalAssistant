Commissioner of Income Tax, Uttar Pradesh v Gupta Brothers Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

21 July 1971
The Judgment was delivered by: K. S. HEGDE, J.
1.  This is an appeal by certificate. The question for decision in this appeal is whether the assessee is entitled to setoff the loss of Rs. 21, 881 incurred by him in speculative business towards the profits earned by him in his other businesses of non-speculative nature in the same accounting year. The relevant assessment year is 1953-1954 and the relevant previous year was from July 6, 1951, to June 24, 1952.
2. Following its earlier decision in Jagannath Mahadeo Prasad v. Commissioner of Income-tax, the Allahabad High Court accepted the contention of the assessee that the set- off claimed by him is permissible. The decision in Jagannath Mahadeo Prasad's case was overruled by this court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Jagannath Mahadeo Prasad. Hence, the decision under appeal cannot be sustained.
3.  Mr. S. T. Desai, learned counsel for the assessee, contended that the decision of this court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Jagannath Mahadeo Prasad requires to be reconsidered. After hearing him, we are not satisfied that there is any ground for reconsidering that decision. In the result, this appeal is allowed and the answer given by the High Court to question No. 1 referred to it, namely, whether, on the facts of the case, the loss of Rs. 21, 881 in Tata deferred (speculative transaction) is an admissible deduction in the determination of the net income, profits and gains from " business " u/s. 10 of the Income-tax Act, is revoked and in its place we answer that question in the negative and in favour of the department. Under the circumstances of the case, we make no order as to costs in this appeal.
Appeal allowed.
