The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Petitioner is a blind lady. She applied to the DDA for allotment of a flat. DDA have five types of accommodations under different schemes prepared by it. There is considerable amount of dispute as to whether the petitioner applied for a Janta Flat, an MIG Flat or LIG Flat. The correspondence exchanged between her and the authorities of the DDA indicates reference to different types of flats at different times.
2.   Petitioner is present in court in person and her advocate states on instruction that the petitioner would be prepared to take one MIG Flat on payment of the requisite money as required under the scheme of the DDA The counter-affidavit of the DDA indicates that there is scope for handicapped persons to be treated on out of turn basis for allotment of a flat of any category. 
In the circumstances, we direct the DDA to allot on out of turn basis an MIG Flat to the petitioner.
The allotment should be made within three months of the deposit and preference should be given to the petitioner in respect of the South Delhi accommodation in the ground floor if it is possible.
The special leave petition is accordingly disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
