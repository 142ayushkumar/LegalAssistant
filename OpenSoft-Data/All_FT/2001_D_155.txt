Shanta Yashwant Waghmare v Dhirubhai P. Ghatlia and Anr
Supreme Court of India

10  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7461/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We do not find any justification in issuing notice on this special leave petition. However, we record the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner never prayed for granting of time before the High Court but the High Court has granted her time to vacate the premises on its own.
2. In our view, this submission does not lie in the mouth of the petitioner to say so before this Court. Without the petitioner's praying for time, we are sure, the High Court would not have granted time. Be that as it may, the special leave petition stands dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
