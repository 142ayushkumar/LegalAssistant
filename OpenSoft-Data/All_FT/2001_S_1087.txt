State of Rajasthan and Anr v Banshi Lal Sharma
Supreme Court of India

5 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10640/1999
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave is granted.
1.  Inasmuch as the respondent was empanelled by the Screening Committee as being eligible to be appointed a Nursing Superintendent Grade-II and it was not the case of the appellant before the High Court that on the date of screening there were no vacancies so as to appoint the respondent as a Nursing Superintendent Grade-II, we do not find any illegality in the impugned order of the High Court to warrant our interference.
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
