Thacker Hariram Motiram v Balkrishan Chatrabhu Thacker and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 April 1988
C.A. No. 361 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Interim order staying dispossession was granted by this Court on January 24, 1986. It appears that before the learned Judge of the High Court the learned advocate who appeared for the petitioner, requested that in view of the fact that the decree for actual possession was being passed in second appeal, the tenant might be given some reasonable time for
"handing over vacant possession of the suit premises to the original plaintiffs"
"stating that vacant possession would be handed over within the aforesaid time."
2.   It appears that the undertaking was affirmed on November 9, 1985 wherein it was stated that the appellant would vacate and give vacant possession of the suit premises by December 31, 1985 i.e., to say after one year if
"by that time no stay order from the Supreme Court is received as I intend to file an appeal in the Supreme Court"
3.  In that view of the matter the interim order is vacated and we direct that the appellant should hand over possession to the respondents forthwith.
Order accordingly.
