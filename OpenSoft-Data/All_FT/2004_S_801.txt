Association of Private Dental And Medical Colleges of Uttar Pradesh v State of Uttar Pradesh and others
Supreme Court of India

2 August 2004
W.P. (C) No. 339 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Having regard to the fact that the petitioners are concerned with admission to the medical and dental courses, we are of the view that it is too late to pass any interim order which would disturb the status quo as of today. As such, the only interim order we pass at this stage is as follows:
"1. The petitioners will be at liberty to approach the Committee without prejudice to the merits contained in the present writ petition to raise any dispute as envisaged in Islamic Academy of Education v. State of Karnataka,2003 Indlaw SC 611as they may deem fit.
2. The petitioners are at liberty to admit students on the basis of the common entrance test held in respect of their quota fixed by the State Government. If there is any vacancy in the petitioners' institutions which remain unfilled out of the Government 65% quota, it will be open to the petitioners to fill up such vacancy from the merit list of common entrance test held by their association."
This order is passed without deciding in any manner whether the State Government had any right to fix the quota it did.
2. Interim order passed earlier stands vacated. It is made clear that this order does not in any way enable the non-recognised institutions to admit students.
Order accordingly.
