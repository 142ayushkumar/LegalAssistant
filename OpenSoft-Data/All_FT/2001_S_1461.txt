Swarup Singh v State of Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

3  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 213/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Petitioner is involved in very serious offences including criminal conspiracy of murder of politicians of this country including the former Chief Minister of Gujarat. The application moved by him for bail has been dismissed, against which this SLP has been filed.
2.  Mr. Jaspal Singh, learned senior counsel contended that there is no evidence against the petitioner for bringing him to conviction. We are told that final report has been laid by the Investigating Officer. Mr. Jaspal Singh admitted that he has not seen the report though the copy has been supplied to the petitioner.
3. It is difficult for us to consider his plea for bail even without petitioner himself seeing the final report. After seeing the final report, if the petitioner feels that there is no evidence against him, it is for the petitioner to substantiate before the trial court for his discharge.
4.  We dismiss this special leave petition without prejudice to his right to substantiate before the trial court that no charge can be formed against him.
Petition dismissed.
