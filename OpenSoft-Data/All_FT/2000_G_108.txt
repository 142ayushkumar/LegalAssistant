Commissioner of Income Tax v Gujarat State Warehousing Corporation Limited
Supreme Court of India

23 February 2000
C.A. No. 6650 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Revenue sought reference on the following questions of law for opinion of the High Court
"1. Whether the claim of the assessee for exemption under s. 10(29) of the IT Act, 1961, in respect of the interest income of Rs. 6,03,374, staff quarters rent of Rs. 5,147, miscellaneous income of Rs. 5,647 and supervision charges of Rs. 79, 081 was rightly accepted by the CIT(A) and confirmed by the Tribunal ?
2. Whether the income received by the assessee from any source other than from letting of godowns or warehouses is exempt under s. 10(29) of the IT Act, 1961 ?"
Applications under s. 256(1) and 256(2) by the (Revenue) were dismissed.
2.  Aggrieved, the Revenue came to this Court. The assessment year involved is 1981-82. We find that on similar questions for the two asst. yrs. 1979-80 and 1983-84, this Court dismissed the special leave petitions filed by the Revenue by the following order.
"SLP (C) Nos. 8701 of 1993 and 8808 of 1986
Delay condoned
In view of the judgment of this Court in Union of India vs. U.P. State Warehousing Corporation 1990 Indlaw SC 9211990 Indlaw SC 921, wherein the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in U.P. State Warehousing Corporation vs. ITO 1973 Indlaw ALL 48 has been affirmed, the special leave petitions are dismissed."
3.  Our attention has been drawn to a decision of this Court in Orissa State Warehousing Corporation vs. CIT 1999 Indlaw SC 1200 : 1999 Indlaw SC 1182 which has taken somewhat different view, particularly, with regard to the interest income.We find a conflict between decisions on which earlier special leave petitions were dismissed and Orissa State Warehousing Corporation vs. CIT (supra).
4. Accordingly, this matter may be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for directions for placing the matter before a larger Bench for decision.
Order accordingly.
