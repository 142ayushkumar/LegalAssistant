Bhawar Lal v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

14 December 1999
C.A. No. 5526 of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The civil suit filed by the plaintiff, who is the appellant before us, along with his mother Judav Bai, for a declaration that the appellant was the adopted son of Dhanna Lai who was the husband of Judav Bai, was decreed, but the decree was set aside by the lower appellate court. The decree was affirmed in the second appeal by the High Court. We have gone through the judgments of the High Court as also of the lower appellate court.
2. Since the question of adoption is a pure question of fact, we see no reason to interfere with those findings. The appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
