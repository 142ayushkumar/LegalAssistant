K.M. Saleem v State of Kerala and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 180-181/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing Mr. PP Rao, learned Sr. counsel at length, we notice that the apprehension of the petitioner is particularly with reference to an observation made by the learned single judge of the High Court that:
"there is prohibition for normal grant of bail imposed through Section 37 of the NDPS Act."
2. Learned senior counsel submits that the said observation is likely to be misunderstood by the Court before which the bail application would be moved as one of imposing a total prohibition for granting bail. We make it clear that the said observation is not to be read like that.
3.  The observation only highlights the need to comply with Sec.37 of the Act while considering the grant of bail. It is clarified like that. This is sufficient to allay any apprehension of the petitioner.
4.  It is pointed out that the High Court has given the petitioner a period of three weeks from the date of impugned order for surrendering before the Court and apply for bail and the said period has already expired. We extend the said period by another two weeks. With these observations these SLPs are disposed of.
Petitions Disposed of.
