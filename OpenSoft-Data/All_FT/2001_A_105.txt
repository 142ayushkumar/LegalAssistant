Ajay Kumar and Anr v State of Punjab and Anr
Supreme Court of India

30 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1208/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court suggested in the impugned order that petitioners can surrender and apply for bail. Shri R.K. Jain, learned senior counsel submits that the apprehension of the petitioners is, on account of some political background, that petitioners are likely be subjected to physical torture.
2.  Learned counsel for the State forcibly repudiated this allegation and assured that no such physical torture would be inflicted to them. This is recorded. If petitioners surrender before the authorities concerned, there can possibly be no need of them after the interrogation is completed.
3. We make it clear that once the interrogation is completed the petitioners would make an application for bail and the same shall be disposed of by directing them to execute a bond with two solvent sureties to the satisfaction of the court concerned. We also permit the trial court to impose such other conditions as may be found necessary.
With these observations these Special Leave Petitions are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
