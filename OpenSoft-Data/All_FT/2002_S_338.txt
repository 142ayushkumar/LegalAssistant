Satish Sharma and Another v State of Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

5 December 2002
Cr.A. No. 1284 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Leave granted.
2. While considering an application for grant of bail to accused in a criminal case, the High Court made certain observation in the order under appeal against the appellants that they have tried to over reach the process of law by submitting a report u/s. 169 Cr. P.C. before the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate to discharge all three accused for serious offences arising under Section 114, 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and u/s. 25(1)(c) of the Arms Act.
3. The High Court observed that by filing the cancellation report the appellants had shown scant regard to the proceedings before the Sessions Court and the High Court, as on two occasions the petitions for anticipatory bail were rejected; that, the appellants have not applied their mind in filing such a report u/s. 169 Cr. P.C. and have tried to interfere with the administration of justice amounting to serious misconduct; that, the State Government should take serious action including suspension from service of both the appellants.
4. If at the stage of grant or refusal of anticipatory bail certain aspects of the case are considered but later if the investigation agency files a report u/s. 169 Cr. P.C. it is difficult to perceive that such a step would amount to interference with the administration of justice.
5. We have carefully gone through the observations made by the learned Judge of the High Court and we are or the opinion that those observations are neither justified nor called for in the case.
6. Therefore, we direct that the observations made in the order of the High Court from paragraph 16 till the end of the order, except the operative part thereof, shall stand expunged.
7. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
