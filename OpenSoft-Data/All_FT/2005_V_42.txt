Vijay Kumar, IAS v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

9 December 2005
I.A. Nos. 4-9 In W.P. (Civil) No(s). 1037 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Petitioner was an IAS Officer. By these petitions u/art. 32 of the Constitution, he questions inter-alia the order suspending him and issuing show cause notice as to why the charges levelled against him should not be framed. In our view approaching this Court u/art. 32 is misconceived. The alternative efficacious remedy is to approach the C.A.T.
2. In this view of the matter these Writ Petitions are dismissed with liberty to the petitioner to urge all the rights and contentions raised in this Court before the C.A.T. Petitioner is also at liberty to amend the petition before the C.A.T.
3. We make it clear that C.A.T. shall hear and dispose of the matter uninfluenced by any observations made by this Court.
4. With the aforesaid observations these I.As and Writ Petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed
