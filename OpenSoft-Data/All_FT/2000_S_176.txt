State of Kerala and Others v Shijin K.K. and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12491-12492/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. The impugned order mainly directs to the following effect:
2. We, therefore, direct the Government to place the matter before the empowered committee and obtain the necessary approval for appointing the required number of teachesrs in different subjects. Since the process of appointment of new lecturers may take some time, the Government, as an interim measure, may consider the appointment of guest lecturers for the time being.'
3.  We do not find any error in such a direction including the appointment of guest lecturer as an interim measure. Learned counsel for the respondents states, which is also not denied by the learned counsel for the petitioner that even the embargo not to make any appointment for a period of three years is over on 3rd June, 2000.
4.  Thus, we do not find any merit in these petitions. We do observe this interim measure of counting with guest lecturer should not be extended too long. Authorities concerned will proceed to complete the process in terms of the impugned order at an early date.
5.  With the said observation the present Special Leave Petitions are dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
