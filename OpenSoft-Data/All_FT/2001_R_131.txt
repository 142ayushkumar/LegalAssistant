Rajkumar v State By Inspector of Police, Madras
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2462/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We are not inclined to re-appreciate or re-evaluate the evidence in this case. The High Court altered the conviction from Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code to Section 304(I) on the premise that the injury inflicted by the appellant was on the thigh of the deceased. The situs of the injury on the thigh is located by the doctor as 71 cms above the left knee joint and 14 cms above the left inguinal region.
2. If the High Court found that the infliction of the said injury is only culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the conviction cannot necessarily fall under Section 304(I) of the IPC. The distinguishing feature between the 1st part and second part of Section 304 of the IPC being the intention to cause death, it is difficult to ascribe such an intention to the assailant who inflicted the injury on the situs pointed out above.
3.  We, therefore, alter the conviction from Section 304(I) of the IPC to Section 304(II) of the IPC.
4. In view of the further alteration in regard to the count of the offence, we are inclined to alter the sentence commensurately also. In the circumstances of the case, we think a sentence of rigourous imprisonment for a period of five years would be sufficient to meet the ends of justice. We impose the said sentence.Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
