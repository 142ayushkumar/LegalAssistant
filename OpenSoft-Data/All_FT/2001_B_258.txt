P. Jayasri v Bollu Ravindranath and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19238/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere in the matter. The special leave petition is dismissed.
2.  Learned counsel for the petitioner then stated that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises in question immediately, he would be put to great hardship and for that reason the petitioner may be granted some time to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is reasonable.
3. We, accordingly, direct that the petitioner shall not be dispossessed from the premises till 30th June, 2002 subject to filing a usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks' from today. In the event the undertaking is not filed, the petition shall automatically stand dismissed without further reference to the Court.
4.  In case the respondent has any grievance to this part of our order, it shall be open to him to apply for vacation of the same.
Petition dismissed.
