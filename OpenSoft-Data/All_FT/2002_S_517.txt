Dipesh Kishor Rach and Anr v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

9 January 2002
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 7232-7233/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Though we are not inclined to interfere with the order by which the High Court refused to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioners, we permit them to surrender before the court concerned within three weeks and apply for bail. On such an application the petitioners shall be released on bail on such terms as the court deems fit.
2. One of the term should be that the petitioners shall report to the investigating officer for interrogation at a time specified by the court.
With these observations the SLPs are disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
