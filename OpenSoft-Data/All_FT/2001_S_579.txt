Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 115/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Respondent-State has been served. Notice has also been served on the Standing Counsel for the State of Bihar, who has already filed his vakalatnama. No objections have been filed. Nobody is present on behalf of the State.
We have perused the record.
Leave granted.
2.  Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the controversy between the parties, in our opinion, in the established facts and circumstances of this case and particularly taking note of the fact that no witness has been examined till date, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and direct that in the event of his arrest the appellant shall be released on bail upon his furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.15,000/- (Fifteen Thousand) with two  solvent sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Patna.
3.  The appellant shall, however, join the investigation as and when required and shall not directly or indirectly tamper with the evidence. The appeal stands disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
