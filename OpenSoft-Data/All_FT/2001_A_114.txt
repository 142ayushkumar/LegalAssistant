The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  On the facts and circumstances of this case, we do not find it a fit case to interfere with the impugned order passed by the High Court dated 16th February, 2000 in its revisional jurisdiction.
2.  However, as the matter is pending since long, we make the observation that the parties, especially the tenant-respondent, shall cooperate in expeditious disposal of the matter before the Rent Controller.
3. The parties shall appear before the Rent Controller on the 3rd of April, 2001 and thereafter, the Rent Controller will fix the date for expeditious disposal.
4.  We further observe, the Rent Controller will dispose of the matter preferably within six months of the aforesaid date. With the said observations, the special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
