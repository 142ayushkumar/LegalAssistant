2. Upon perusal of the record and the sale instances, we find that the valuation arrived at by the Reference Court was more just and therefore, we set aside the impugned judgment delivered by the High Court and restore the order passed by the Reference Court under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984.
3. The appeals stand disposed of as allowed with no order as to costs. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
