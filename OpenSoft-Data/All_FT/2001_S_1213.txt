State of Uttar Pradesh and Others v Messrs Vinyl Tubes Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

19 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)..CC.8876/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not satisfied that the delay has been sufficiently explained. However learned counsel has vehemently argued and relied upon the judgment of this Court in N. Balakrishnan vs. M.Krishnamurthy.
2. In that case delay was caused on account of inaction of the advocate and the proceedings were initiated against him before the Consumer Forum. It was in those circumstances the Court thought it fit to condone the delay. However, in this case, we do not find any sufficient cause to condone the delay. IAs 1 and 2/2000 are therefore dismissed.
Consequently the SLP is also dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
