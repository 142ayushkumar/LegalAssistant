Supreme Court of India

19 October 2005
C.A. No. 4352 of 2000 With C.A. No, 4359 Of2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This order shall dispose of both the appeals. The facts are taken from Civil Appeal No. 4352 of 2000.
2.  This is a statutory Appeal under Section 35L(b) of Central Excise Act, 1944 (for short 'the Act') against the final judgment and order bearing No. 72/2000-B, dated 13-1-2000 in Appeal No. E/276/90-B passed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the 'Tribunal')
3.  The duty demand of Rs. 31, 24, 189.11 in the present case relates to the period 1-3-1988 to 31-8-1988, when the classification list filed w.e.f. 1-3-1988, was finally approved on 13-6-1988 under the chapter heading claimed by the respondent-assessee i.e. Chapter Heading 73.26.
4.  Appellant issued two show cause notices to the respondent-assessee in September, 1988 (covering the period 1-3-1988 to 22-6-1988) and November, 1988 (for the period 23-6-1988 to 31-8-1988) proposing reclassification under Heading 87.08 and 84.83.
5.  The Tribunal, relying upon a decision of this Court in the case of Collector of Central Excise, Vadodara v. Cotspun Limited reported in 1999 Indlaw SC 82, held that when the goods have been cleared on the basis of approved classification list, the demand can only be prospective and consequently set aside the demand as unsustainable.
The Legislature intervened and amended the provisions of Section 11A of the Act by Finance Act, 2000 with retrospective effect to take away the effect of the judgment of this Court in Cotspun Limited's case. The amended Act was challenged and this Court in ITW Signode India Limited v. Collector of Central Excise reported in  (relied on) upheld the constitutional validity of the Amending Act i.e. Finance Act, 2000 amending Section 11A of the Act. Resultantly the duty could be levied retrospective as well.
6.  Since the law Jaid down by this Court in Cotspun Limited's case (supra) is no longer a good law, the order passed by the Tribunal has to be set aside and accordingly we accept this appeal and set aside the order of the Tribunal. As the Tribunal did not decide the dispute on the merits, the case is remitted to the Tribunal for a fresh decision on merits.
7.  The Appeals are allowed, as indicated above. Parties shall bear their own costs.
Appeals allowed.
