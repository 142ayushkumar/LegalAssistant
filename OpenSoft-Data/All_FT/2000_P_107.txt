Prakash Road Lines Limited v Commercial Tax Officer and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 September 2000
C.A. No. 5059 of 2000 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (C) No. 2467 of 2000)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court by the order under challenge declined to entertain a revision petition, which it referred to as a reference petition, on the ground that a referable question of law did not arise. It took the view that as the driver of the truck carrying the appellant's goods had failed to surrender the transit pass when leaving the Karnataka border, tax and penalty would necessarily become leviable by reason of the provisions of Section 28-AA of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957.
2.  Our attention has been drawn to the terms of Section 28-AA and to the judgment of this Court in Sodhi Transport Co. v. State of U.P. 1984 Indlaw SC 248 ; 1986 Indlaw SC 136.
3. We think that, in the circumstances, a question of law does arise for consideration in the revision petition.
4.  Accordingly, the order under challenge is set aside. The revision petition is restored to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits. This shall be done expeditiously. All available contentions shall be open to either side.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
