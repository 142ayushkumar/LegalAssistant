The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard counsel for the parties. We do not find any merit in the petition. It is accordingly, dismissed.
2.  Mr. ML Verma, learned senior counsel, appearing for the petitioner states that in case the petitioner is to vacate the premises, he and his family shall put to a great hardship and, therefore, sometime may be granted to vacate the same. This request is not opposed.
3.  We, therefore, direct that the petitioner shall not vacate the premises till 31.12.2001 provided he files a usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from today. The petitioner shall handover vacant and peaceful possession of the premises to the landlord on or before the said date.
