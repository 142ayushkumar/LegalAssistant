New India Assurance Co. Ltd v N.R. Usharani & Ors
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2008
Appeal (civil) 4021 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This appeal has been preferred by the Insurance Company. Admittedly, the claimant was a pillion rider. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in New India Assurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Asha Rani & Ors., (2003) 2 SCC 223 2002 Indlaw SC 1460 has held that the pillion rider is not covered by the policy and, therefore, the Insurance company is not liable to pay compensation.
2.  This appeal is squarely covered by the decision in Asha Rani Case. In view thereof, the order of the High Court is set aside. This appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed
