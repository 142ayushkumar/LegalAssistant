K.S. George (D) By LRs v V. Ramachandra Reddiar and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.5155-5156/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard Mr. V.J. Francis learned counsel for the petitioners and Mr.P.Krishnamurthi learned senior counsel for the respondents.
2.  We are satisfied that no ground is made out to interfere with the impugned order therefore the special leave petitions are dismissed.
3. However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and as the petitioners are running an educational institution, we consider it just and appropriate to grant time to them for vacating the premises in question.
4.  Accordingly we grant time to the petitioners to vacate the premises on or before 31st of May, 2002 subject to their filing an usual undertaking within four weeks from today and paying the amount decreed against them.
It is implicit that during the said period the petitioners will have to pay the monthly rent regularly.
Petitions dismissed.
