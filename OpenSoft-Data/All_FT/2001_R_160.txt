Paras v Ram Dhari and Anr
Supreme Court of India

19 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13874/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The notice on the special leave petition stated that the matter might be disposed of at this stage. The respondent has been served but has not chosen to put in an appearance.
2.  We have heard learned counsel and perused the order under challenge. We are of the view that the order under challenge must be set aside and the matter restored to the file of the High Court to be heard afresh in the light of all the facts and the law, after hearing the appellant before us. The High Court may consider giving notice to Khaderu, who is referred to in the order under challenge, before doing so. It shall be open to the parties to raise all available contentions.
3. We refrain from saying any more because we do not wish to prejudice the case on either side.
4.  The appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The matter (F.A.F.O.No.257/1983) is restored to the file of the High Court to be heard afresh. No order as to costs.
Appeal Allowed.
