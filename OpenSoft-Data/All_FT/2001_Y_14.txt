Yesumarial v Assistant Educational Officer, Kerala and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16265/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr. CS Rajan, learned senior counsel argued first on the point that the leave vacancy was not altogether declared to be illegal as the concerned teacher was permitted to avail half-pay-leave. This does not impress us on the ground that the fact on which she claimed leave was found to be fradulent.
2.  Ld. senior counsel then made an alternative plea that the 5th respondent was not a qualified teacher and if that fact was upheld, the vacancy would become open in which case the petitioner may also get a chance to contest. Though the said point was raised before the learned single judge of the High Court, it appears that it was not urged before the Division Bench. Ld. counsel submitted that the petitioner would be advised to move for review before the Division Bench.
3. In order to facilitate the said course of action, he seeks permission of this Court to withdraw the SLP. It is accordingly dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
