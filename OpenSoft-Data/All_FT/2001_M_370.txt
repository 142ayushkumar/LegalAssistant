Alapan Bandopadhyay v Messrs Nirala Properties Private Limited and
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20965-20968/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This matter was moved before this Court on 10.12.2001 wherein at the initial stage, we thought it expedient to direct that the application should be heard along with the main appeal.
2. But, thereafter, upon hearing some submissions of the parties, we re-considered the matter and directed that the application should appear one week after the holidays on a non-miscellaneous day.
3.  Such recording as is appearing in the order dated 10.12.2001 seems to be not in order. The first three lines upto the `disposal of the appeal', as recorded in the order dated 10.12.2001, shall thus be deleted and let this matter thus come up one week after the holidays for final disposal on a non-miscellaneous day.
Let this order be incorporated in the order dated 10.12.2001.
Ordered accordingly.
