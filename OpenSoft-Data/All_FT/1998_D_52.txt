Supreme Court of India

11 August 1998
C.A. No. 2287 of 1995 (Arising as an appeal by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 10 April 1987, of the Madhya Pradesh High Court at Jabalpur in Miscellaneous Petition No. 4006 of 1986).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have read the judgment and order of the High Court under appeal and we have heard learned counsel. We are satisfied that the crushing of dolomite lumps into chips and powder is not a process of manufacture that brings about a new commercial commodity.
2.  The view taken by the High Court must, therefore, be upheld. The appeal is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
