1.  We see no reason to entertain this petition for special leave to appeal, especially in view of the judgment we have rendered today in Civil Appeal No. of 2007 (arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) No.9739 of 2005). The suit will be tried and disposed of afresh in the light of the directions contained therein.
The petition is dismissed.
