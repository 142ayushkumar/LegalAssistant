Commissioner, Central Excise, Nagpur v Messrs Wainganga Sahkari S. Karkhana Limited
Supreme Court of India

18 April 2002
Civil Appeal No. 496 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  The Tribunal was concerned with whether making trusses, columns and purlines amounted to manufacture. The Tribunal followed an earlier decision in the case of Aruna Industries, Vishakhapatnam v. C.C.E., Guntur (1986) 25 ELT 580 1986 Indlaw CEGAT 224. It did not follow another decision in the case of Structurals and Machineries (Bokaro) Pvt. Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise. (1984) 17 ELT 127 1984 Indlaw CEGAT 19583.
2.  It is submitted on behalf of the Revenue that there are conflicting views taken by the Tribunal and that such conflicting views have been taken even after the impugned order.
3.  In one of these subsequent judgments, in the case of Richardson and Cruddas (1972) Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, [1988] 38 ELT 176 1988 Indlaw CEGAT 474, the case of Aruna Industries 1986 Indlaw CEGAT 224 (supra) has been considered and found to be applicable to a situations where the assessee was erecting the structures at the constructions site and fabricating materials on the spot; it was therefore found that this could not be considered to be fabrication in a factory. Now, in the instant case, the Tribunal noted that it had been found as a fact by the Collector that the assessee had undertaken fabrication work at site. This was a case, therefore, to which the decision of Aruna Industries 1986 Indlaw CEGAT 224 (supra) applied and the Tribunal's order cannot be faulted.
The appeal is dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal Dismissed
