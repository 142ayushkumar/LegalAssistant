Supreme Court of India

3 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil).../1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the State submits that in respect of the parcel of land situate in survey no.419 of Village Gothri, the possession has not been taken. Hence the order in respect of that land will be on par with the order passed by this Court dated 26.4.2001 in CA No.3828/1996.
2. About the other land in survey no.716 of Gotri Village the Government's stand is that the possession has been taken and since the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act 1976 has since been repealed the State of Gujarat is not interested in proceeding with the matter further.
This is recorded and the SLP is closed.
Petition disposed of.
