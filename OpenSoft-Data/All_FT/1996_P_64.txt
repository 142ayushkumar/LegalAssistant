Bharat Builders Private Limited and Others v Parijat Flat Owners' Cooperative Housing Society Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 April 1996
C.A. No. 7032 of 1996 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 6 March 1995 of the Bombay High Court in L.P.A. No. 16 of 1994 in W.P. No. 3092 of 1992)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  While we are hearing the matter on the procedural part of listing for admission of the writ petitions filed under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India in Bombay High Court, Mr. Anil B. Diwan, learned senior counsel for the respondents, has stated that a direction may be given to place this matter before the Division Bench for disposal. We think that the appropriate course would be that the matter may be placed before the Division Bench. The learned, Chief Justice of the High Court is requested to place the matter before the Division Bench presided over by him or some other Bench for final disposal. We are informed that against the suit for specific performance decreed by the Civil Judge, City Civil Court F.A. No.869/92 has been filed and the Court has directed that the appeal also may be tagged along with the writ Petition. We are informed that the matter has already been tagged with the writ petition. In that view of the matter, it would be expedient that both the matters may be disposed of together by the Division Bench. We are informed that the respondents are also anxious to have the matter disposed of. Under these circumstances, we request the High Court have the matters disposed of as expeditiously as possible preferably within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of this order.
The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.
