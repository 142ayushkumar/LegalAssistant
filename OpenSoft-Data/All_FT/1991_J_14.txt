Assistant Commissioner (Assessment), Sales Tax Special Circle, Trichur v Janatha Expeller Company and Others
Supreme Court of India

31 October 1991
C.A. No. 466 of 1987. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 11 July 1986, of the Kerala High Court in W.A. No. 273 of 1983. The Judgment of the High Court is reported at [1987] 64 STC 435 (Ker)
The Order of the Court is as follows
1. This is an appeal from the judgment of the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court holding that the tax payable by the respondents under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956
2. However, an issue regarding the interpretation of s. 8(2A) of the Central Sales Tax Act also seems to have been agitated before the High Court in this matter and the State's grievance is principally against the interpretation of that provision. The interpretation of that provision falls for consideration in other appeals which are listed before us today but, so far as the respondents in this appeal are concerned, it is unnecessary to go into this question. We, therefore, find no merit in this appeal which is dismissed with costs.
3. As stated, the interpretation of s. 8(2A) will be considered by us in other batches of appeals  pending before us.
