Ajit Kumar Dev Ray (Dead) By Lrs v Sujit Kumar Dutta (Dead) By Lrs
Supreme Court of India

20 November 2003
C.A. No.5231 Of 1997

The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal has been preferred against the Judgment rendered by the Gauhati High Court in a second appeal. It appears that the suit was dismissed by the trial court. On appeal being taken the lower appellate court decreed the suit. When the matter was taken to the High Court in second appeal, at the time of admission, the only substantial question of law, which was framed, was whether the learned Munsif had jurisdiction to try the instant suit. From the impugned Judgment it appears that the High Court has not gone into this question and without framing any other substantial question of law at the time of hearing, has gone into the facts of the case and reversed the decree passed by the lower appellate court and restored the decree passed by the trial court.
It is well settled that in a second appeal, at the time of hearing, if the court feels that any other substantial question of law arises, the same shall be framed and thereafter the court shall proceed to decide the same. As in the present case no other substantial question of law was framed by the High Court at the time of hearing of the appeal, we feel it would be just and expedient to remit the matter to the High Court for deciding afresh.
2.  The appeal is, accordingly, allowed, the impugned Judgment rendered by the High Court is set aside and the matter is remitted to that court for deciding the appeal afresh in accordance with law and after framing substantial question of law, if any.
No costs.
Appeal allowed.
