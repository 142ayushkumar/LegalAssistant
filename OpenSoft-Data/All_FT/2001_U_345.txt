United India Insurance Company Limited v Kundan Lal Mahaldar
Supreme Court of India

12 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11202/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Though notice has been duly served, but no one has entered appearance.
2.  The Arbitrator has awarded interest 18% P.A. from 15.09.1992 till the awarded amount is paid. This obviously was beyond the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator as he could have allowed interest only till the order is made a rule of the Court and a decree is passed thereon, because subsequently it is only the Court's power to grant interest any further.
3. In view of the judgment of this Court in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. M.K.J. Corporation, it would be reasonable to hold that the interest should be 12 per cent instead of 18%. We, therefore, modify the award to that extent. This petition stands disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
