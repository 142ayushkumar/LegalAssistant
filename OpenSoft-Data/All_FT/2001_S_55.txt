S.N.Kulkarni v S.P.Gayawal and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17447/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  On 6.12.1999, this Court directed status quo to be maintained in the meantime. We are told that between the parties a partition suit is pending before Civil Judge, Junior Division, Bhor, District Pune. Though we are very much distressed if not stunned when we heard that it was a suit of 1986 which has not even reached the stage of preliminary decree.
2. Learned counsel for the parties appearing now submitted that a motion would be made before the trial court for expeditious disposal of the said suit. Till the said suit is disposed of by the trial court, the status quo will continue. This is without prejudice to the power of the trial court in the partition suit to pass any interim orders relating to the subject matter of the suit.
3.  In view of this order, it is needless to say that the suit for injunction from which the present appeal arose has become infructuous. The parties can now seek their reliefs in the partition suit mentioned above. With these observations, the appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
