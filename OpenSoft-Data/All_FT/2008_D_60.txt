Delhi Transport Corporation v Mool Chand
Supreme Court of India

2 December 2008
Civil Appeal No. 7258 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This Appeal has been filed against the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 06th November, 2001. It appears that there was a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (for short 'VRS') in the Delhi Transport Corporation, hereinafter referred to as the 'Corporation', in 1993 which contained a provision for pension. The respondent herein did not apply under that VRS Scheme.
2.  Subsequently, the Corporation framed a new Scheme dated 13.12.1995 in which it was specifically stated that those employees who opt for VRS under the new Scheme will not get pension. Respondent, admittedly, applied under this scheme.
3.  Since, there was a specific provision in the VRS Scheme dated 13.12.1995, we fail to see how the High Court has held that the respondent will get pension in addition to VRS benefits.
In view of above, we find that the impugned judgment of the High Court is erroneous and it is hereby set aside.
The Appeal is allowed accordingly. No Order as to costs.
