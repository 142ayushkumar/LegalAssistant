Ahammedkutty v Abdullakoya
Supreme Court of India

3 August 2007
Cr.A.No.1013 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  Compensation can be directed to be paid both in terms of sub-section (1) of Section 357 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as also sub-section (3) thereof. However, while exercising jurisdiction under sub-section (3) of Section 357, no direction can be issued that in default to pay the amount of compensation, the accused shall suffer simple imprisonment. Such an order could have been passed only in terms of sub-section (1) of Section 357 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 If the compensation directed to be paid by the Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under sub-section (3) of 357, Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is not deposited, the same can be realized as fine in terms of Section 421 of the Code.
2. We are, therefore, of the opinion that that part of the impugned order whereby and whereunder the appellant has been directed to undergo imprisonment for a period of one month, in the event of default to pay compensation under subsection (3) of Section 357, is set aside. Rest of the order of the High Court is upheld.
The Appeal is disposed of with the aforementioned observations.
Appeal disposed of.
