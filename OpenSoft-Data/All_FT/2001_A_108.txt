State, Government of Nct of Delhi v Ajay S. Lal
Supreme Court of India

12 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.)......./2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  When one of the accused was deleted from the array of the parties by the impugned order dated 13.1.2000 it occurred to the State Government of Delhi to move this court only on 2.5.2001. The inordinate delay has not been explained. The State Authorities did not give instructions to the counsel as to what transpired from the trial case regarding the trial against the remaining accused.
2. Possibly, number of witnesses could have been examined by the trial court, if not, the trial against them had reached the final stage.
We deprecate the manner in which the State Government caused this undue delay in approaching this Court and rendered the very Special Leave Petition infructuous at the belated stage.
We, therefore, dismiss this Special Leave Petition.
Petition dismissed.
