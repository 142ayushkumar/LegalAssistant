Union of India v Balbir Singh and Another
Supreme Court of India

21 January 2000
C.A. No. 476 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In similar circumstances delay had been condoned vide order dated 17-9-1999 in Union of India v. Nathu Singh. In the circumstances of this case, we are inclined to condone the delay, particularly, because it is in the public interest as public money is involved.
Leave granted.
2.  We heard Mr. K. C. Kaushik, learned counsel for the appellant. In view of the decision of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 4405 of 1997 in which the land value has been fixed at Rs. 16,750/- per bigha for lands covered by the same notification, there is no reason not to adopt the same value as for the land involved in this appeal also. Accordingly, we allow this appeal and reduce the land value to the above extent. The impugned order stands modified accordingly.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
