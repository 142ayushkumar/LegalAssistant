Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16619/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The interim order granted by the High Court on 20.9.1991 was vacated nearly ten years later even before the final hearing of the matter.
2.  In the circumstances we think the interim order granted earlier by the High Court should have been continued till disposal of the appeal. The order made by the High Court vacating the interim order shall stand set aside and the same shall remain continued until disposal of the appeal before the High Court. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
