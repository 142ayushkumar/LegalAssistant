CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.1267 OF 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. The trial court convicted the appellant under Section 325 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay fine of Rs. 500/-; in default, to undergo further imprisonment for a period of four months. On appeal being preferred, the High Court confirmed the conviction and sentence.
Hence, this appeal by special leave.
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant pressed this appeal on the question of sentence and made a prayer that as the appellant has remained in custody for about one year, sentence for imprisonment awarded to him may be reduced to the period already undergone.
3. In our view, the ends of justice would be met in case the sentence of imprisonment awarded to the appellant is reduced to the period already undergone.
4. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed in part. While upholding the conviction of the appellant, sentence of imprisonment awarded to him is reduced to the period already undergone. The appellant, who is on bail, is discharged from the liability of bail bonds
Appeal allowed
