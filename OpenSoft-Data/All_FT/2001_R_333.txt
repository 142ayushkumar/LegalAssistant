Rotary Club of Begusarai v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.1793/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
1.  We are surprised to find the attitude of Rotary Club of Begusarai-petitioner to approach this Court against an order passed by the Patna High Court in a Public Interest Litigation. In our view, sufficient costs should have been awarded against the Rotary Club who has encroached upon the National Highway by constructing a building, which building was grossly detrimental to the public interest and, therefore, on a Public Interest Litigation direction to demolish has been passed. The authorities or persons who have decided to approach this Court, have forgotten their own moto for which the club had been established and obviously, the moto was not to encroach upon the Government land.
This petition accordingly stands dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
