Supreme Court of India

9 August 1995
C.As. No. ... of 1995 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 13426 of 1987) with Nos. ... of 1995 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 13270 of 1987, 4702-04 of 1986, 2844-51, 2686, 2758, 2765, 2771, 2772, 3346-47 and 11337 of 1987) 3499 of 1987 and 5626 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Special leave granted in all the special leave petitions.
1.  By Notification No. GSR 1152 dated 24-7-1967 issued under Section 25(1) of the Customs Act, the Government exempted iron ore fines falling under Item 29 of the Second Schedule to the Tariff Act when exported out of India from so much of the duty leviable thereon as is in excess of Rs. 3 per metric ton, where the iron content in the iron ore fines was below 62% and where it exceeds 62% so much of the duty as is in excess of Rs. 4 per metric ton. By another Notification dated 31-8-1968 the Government exempted lumpy iron ore falling under Item 28 of the Second Schedule to the Tariff Act when exported out of India from so much of the duty as was in excess of the duty shown in Column (iii) depending on the iron content in the iron ore.
2.   It may be mentioned here that the duty had to be determined on the basis of weight of the commodity at the relevant point of time. In the case of lumpy iron ore where the percentage of iron was 60% or more but less than 63% the duty was restricted to Rs. 6 per metric ton, where it was 58% or more but less than 60% it was restricted to Rs. 5 per metric ton and where it was less than 58% it was restricted to Rs. 4 per metric ton.
3.  It will thus be seen that under both the notifications referred to above the duty was relatable to weight depending on the iron content in the ore or the ore fines. The question which was posed before the High Court was whether the percentage of iron content had to be determined after ignoring moisture in the lump or the percentage had to be determined taking all the impurities including moisture into account. The Revenue opted for the first method whereas the assessees contended that the percentage had to be determine taking all the impurities including moisture into account. The learned Single Judge in the High Court ruled in favour of the assessee and the Division Bench agreed with the view taken by the learned Single Judge and hence these appeals.
4.  Mr. Baypee, the learned counsel for the Revenue, strongly contended that the method of determining the iron content in the iron ore and the iron fines is to first eliminate the moisture and then the other impurities and ascertain the content of iron and determine its percentage without taking the moisture into consideration. This, he submitted, was the method which is normally employed under the ISI standard as well as by Chemical Analysts who are called upon to determine iron content in lumpy iron ore or iron ore fines.
5.   It is immaterial what method one adopts for the purposes of separating the iron content from the lumpy iron ore but the percentage has to be determined from the total weight which was available at the given point of time after the iron content is determined. That is because the duty is relatable to weight and, therefore, once the iron content is determined keeping in mind the total weight the percentage can be determined separating the iron content from the rest of the impurities inclusive of moisture and thereafter ascertain in which category the lumpy iron ore would fall for the purposes of charging duty under the aforesaid notifications.
6.  This view which the learned Single Judgment took and which came to be affirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court appears to us to be the correct view to take, for the reason that if the percentage of iron content is determined after ignoring the moisture the percentage would not be relatable to the lumpy iron ore weighed at the relevant point of time for the purposes of charging duty. We therefore, do not think that the High Court committed any mistake in the view it took. Even if two views were possible the view taken by the High Court being a plausible one would not call for intervention by this Court.
7.  In the result, the appeals fail and are dismissed with no order as to costs. The question of refund will be considered in accordance with law where refund is not already given.
Appeals dismissed.
