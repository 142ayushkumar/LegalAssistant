Special leave granted.
1.  The appellant has been convicted of an offence u/s. 332 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three months and a fine of Rs. 500, the sentence in default of payment of fine being rigorous imprisonment for a month. It would suffice for the ends of justice to convert the unexpired portion of the substantive sentence of imprisonment into a fine of Rs. 1500, so that the sentence imposed upon him, as amended hereby, would be rigorous imprisonment for the period of already undergone (which is 29 days) and a total fine of Rs. 2000.
2. We order accordingly. If the fine is not paid the appellant shall suffer rigorous imprisonment for three months. Out of the fine realised, a sum of Rs. 1000 shall be paid to respondent 1 as compensation.
With the above modification in the sentence, the appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
