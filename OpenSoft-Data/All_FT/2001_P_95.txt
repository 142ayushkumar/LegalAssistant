Patel Mohanbhai Ravjibhai v Bharat Kumar Mansukhlal Buddhadev and Anr
Supreme Court of India

17 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2513/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
First respondent is an accused in a murder case.
1.  After completing the investigation the police filed a charge-sheet in the case alleging that the first respondent alongwith the co-accused is guilty of Sec.302, 352 etc of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
2. By the impugned order a learned single Judge of the High Court of Gujarat allowed the first respondent to be released on bail. The aggrieved complainant has filed this appeal by special leave.
3.  We do not want to give detailed reasons for upsetting the impugned order except saying that learned Single judge has not considered the bail application from the angle provided under Sec.437(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
4.  This Court has emphasised time and again the need for adopting the said angle while considering the question of enlarging the accused on bail when the offence involved is punishable with death or imprisonment for life, vide Prahlad Singh Bhati vs. NCT Delhi and in Ram Prakash Pandey vs. State of U.P.
5.  In the result we set aside the impugned order. We direct the first respondent to surrender forthwith.
6.  It is open to the first respondent to move the High Court for bail afresh. If any such application is made it will be disposed of in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made above.The appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
