Rajaram Manohar Vahikar and another v Shri Narayan Kisan Shirsalkar
Supreme Court of India

15 January 2003
C.A. No. 293 of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 20981 of 2001)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Leave granted.
2. Heard the learned counsel for the parties exhaustively.
3. The short question involved in this appeal is whether the judgment and decree dated 10.9.1980 passed by the High Court in Special Civil Application Nos. 2762/1976, 2764/1976 and 3562/1976 between the parties attaining finality could be reversed in Execution Proceedings on the ground that respondent had become lawful sub-tenant after amendment of S. 15 sub-s. (2) of The Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Rent Act').
3. It is stated that against that judgment and decree dated 10.9.1980 respondent preferred Civil Appeal No. 2374/1980 before this Court. That appeal was dismissed as abated on 19.2.1992. Hence, the said judgment and decree became final between the parties. Thereafter, the execution proceedings were dragged on for more than ten years.
4. Admittedly, when the petitions were decided on 10.9.1980, S. 15(2) of the Rent Act was not amended. However, the amendment in S. 15 sub-s. (2) was introduced on 1.10.1987 and it was given retrospective effect from 1.2.1973.
5. Further, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that in the present case there is no question of considering the provisions of S. 15(2) because of following finding of fact recorded by the High Court in the aforesaid petitions on 10.9.1980. The Court specifically held as under:-
"That fact is not sufficient to concluded that Narayan was in occupation as a sub-lessee of Udhavrao. From these documents the learned Joint Judge was clearly in error in jumping to the conclusion that Udhavrao had inducted Narayan as a sub-tenant prior to the year 1959. Save and except these five documents, there is nothing on record to establish the claim of sub-lease in favour of Narayan. It must be appreciated that the creation of sub-lease by contract between the parties is required to be established by specific and clear evidence. The mere allegation that from the year 1949 Narayan was in exclusive occupation is not sufficient. Both Kamalabai and Narayan were unable to furnish the date from which Narayan was in occupation as an unlawful sub-tenant. The mere fact that Narayan was in occupation and was running the business was, in my judgment, insufficient to conclude that Narayan was an unlawful sub-tenant prior to 1959 and was entitled to protection of Rent Act. Both the courts were in error in refusing decree infavour of the landlord on the ground of unlawful subletting".
6. Considering the aforesaid finding it is clear that there was no sub-tenancy in favour of the respondent in 1980. That finding of fact is binding and conclusive between the parties in an execution proceedings.
In this view of the matter, in our view, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court in W.P. No. 2211/1995 on 3.7.2001 is, on the face of it illegal, erroneous and without referring to the judgment rendered by the court in previous proceedings between the parties.
7. In the result, the appeal is allowed, impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is set aside. As the proceedings are pending between the parties since years, the Executing Court is directed to finalise the proceedings within four months from today and to see that possession of the property is handed over to the appellant.There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
