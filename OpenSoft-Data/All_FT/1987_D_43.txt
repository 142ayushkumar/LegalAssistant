Diannatius v State of Kerala
Supreme Court of India

14 January 1987
Cr.A. No. 28 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Special Leave granted. Heard both the sides.
2. In view of the fact that the amount of Rs. 18, 000 said to have been defalcated has been restored to the Kerala State Financial Corporation and the appellant has remained in jail after he surrendered till he was released on bail, we are of the opinion that this is a matter where the sentence deserves to be reduced.
3. We accordingly allow the appeal insofar as the question of sentence is concerned and reduce the sentence from one of one year's rigorous imprisonment to that of the period already undergone. The appellant need not, therefore, surrender.
Appeal allowed.
