National Insurance Company Limited v Parmar Mahiben and others
Supreme Court of India

19 July 2000
C.As. Nos. 8686-87 of 1983 with No. 2807 of 1992
the Order of the Court was as follows:
CAs Nos. 8686-87 of 1983.
1.  The question raised in these appeals is, whether a passenger travelling in the goods vehicle is required to be insured. This matter is squarely covered by the judgment of this Court in favour of the Insurance Company, reported in Mallawwa v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. 1998 Indlaw SC 1321 where it is held that he is not required to be insured. We make it clear that these cases are also a case under the 1939, Act.
2. Accordingly, the appeals succeed in favour of the Insurance Company to the extent of its liability. The High Court judgment is set aside to that extent. Costs on the parties.
CA No. 2807 of 1992.
3.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. The appeal stands concluded as against the appellant and in favour of the Insurance Company reported in Mallawwa v. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. 1998 Indlaw SC 1321.
4. In view of the order passed by this Court in CAs Nos. 8686-87 of 1983, this appeal is dismissed. Costs on the parties.
Appeals disposed of.
