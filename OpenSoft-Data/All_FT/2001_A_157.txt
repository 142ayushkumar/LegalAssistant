Ami Lal v Sita Ram and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14427/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The order under challenge was passed on a civil revision petition. It refers in one brief paragraph to what counsel for the petitioner argued, in another brief paragraph to what the counsel for the first respondent argued and then in another brief paragraph quashes the order appealed against because no infirmity is found in the view taken by the first court.
2. We do not think that this is an appropriate way in which a civil revision petition should be decided. If it proposes to set aside the order of the court below, there should be a far greater discussion of the reasons for so doing.
3.  The civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The civil revision petition (No. 3847 of 2001) is  restored to the file of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana to be heard and disposed of afresh, having due regard to what we have stated. This shall be done expeditiously.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
