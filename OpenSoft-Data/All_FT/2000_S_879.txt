Swadeshi Polytex Ltd v Collector Of Central Excise, Meerut
Supreme Court of India

20 July 2000
C.A. No. 4728 of 1992, Dt. 20 July 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Tribunal in the present case has remanded the matter to the Collector for a fresh decision after coming to the conclusion that there had been a denial of the principles of natural justice. While remanding the case, the Tribunal, however, upheld the finding of the Collector that the appellant herein will have no right to cross examine the witnesses on whose statements the Collector had relied upon.
2.  The point in issue in the present case was whether a commodity which is categorised as waste by the appellant can be regarded as good quality fibre by the department and excise duty levied thereon. In order to justify the levy of excise duty, the Collector had referred to and relied upon the statement of some persons who are alleged to have utilised the said waste for the purposes of spinning yarn.
3.  The learned Counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant should be given an opportunity of cross-examining those witnesses in order to determine whether the waste in question could be categorised as fibre for the purposes of levy of excise duty. He does not wish to cross-examine any other witness on those other statements to which reference may have been made.
4.  In the facts and circumstances of the present case, we consider that this contention is well founded. When the Collector has to decide afresh, he should, if he intends to rely upon the statement of any such person, give an opportunity of cross-examination to the appellant. The appeal is disposed of in the aforesaid terms. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
