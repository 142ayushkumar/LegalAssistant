Supreme Court of India

16 October 1986
W.P. No. 574 with W.P. No. 633 of 1986
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  We are glad that as a result of these writ petitions and the various orders made from time to time in the writ petitions the Government of Tamil Nadu has come forward with a scheme which has met with the approval of the Sub-Collector of Kodaikanal as well as of Shri Mehboob Batcha, Commissioner appointed by this Court. The scheme sets out various measures which are proposed to be taken by the State Government for rehabilitation of 157 families who were working in the Kodaikanal hills and for whose benefit the present writ petitions have been brought.
2.   We have no doubt that the scheme will be implemented properly and effectively and several suggestions which have been made by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners will be considered and to the extent found feasible they will be taken into account in implementing the scheme. With these observations the writ petitions will stand disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
