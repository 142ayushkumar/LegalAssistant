Maniklal Jain v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 120/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant stands convicted under Section 304-B of IPC and a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for seven years. He filed an appeal before the High Court.
2.  During the pendency of the appeal, he moved an application for suspending the sentence but the High court declined to do so by this impugned order.
3.  In view of the decision of this Court in Bhagwan Rama Shinde Gosain and Ors vs. State of Gujarat  there is no reason to refrain from suspending the sentence as the State could not show any exceptional ground in this case. We therefore make the order dated 8.1.2001 absolute.
The appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
