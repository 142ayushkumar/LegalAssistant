Sabir Hussain and Another v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 November 1995
Civil Appeal No. 3487 of 1979 with Civil Appeal No. 3488 of 1979
The Judgment was delivered by : K. Ramaswamy, J.
1.  Though the case has been called twice, the appellants are not present in person. We have taken the assistance of Shri K.S. Chauhan, learned counsel appearing for the State. The controversy raised in this case is covered by the judgment of this Court in Ramesh Chand v. State of U.P. [(1980) 1 SCR 498] 1979 Indlaw SC 367 where this Court had held that "failure to specify number of services would not invalidate the draft scheme under Section 68 C or the approved scheme under Section 68D of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939". Same is the question in these appeals also. Under these circumstances, the omission to specify the number of services in the approved scheme does not invalidate the scheme already approved.
The appeals are accordingly dismissed but in the circumstances without costs.
Appeal dismissed
