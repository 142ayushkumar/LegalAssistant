Union of India v Pooranchandra Rao
Supreme Court of India

20 January 1982
C.A. No. 431 of 1976.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
This appeal is filed against the judgment and order dated December 11,1974 in Writ Appeal No.324 of 1973 dismissing a letters patent appeal against the order of the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Writ Petition No.940 of 1972 issuing a writ in the nature of mandamus to the appellants directing them to interview the respondent for the post of Assistant Director of Census Operations in the office of the Director of Census Operations, Hyderabad and to decide whether he could be appointed in the said post.
The Division Bench, which heard the letters patent appeal has held that the application of the respondent who was the petitioner in the writ petition had not been duly considered by the Union Public Service Commission and that there was violation of Art. 14 and Art. 16 of the Constitution. On going through the judgment of the learned Single Judge and of the Division Bench we are of the opinion that the finding that the Union Public Service Commission had not duly considered the case of the respondent is unassailable.No question of law arises for consideration.
1. The judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court does not call for any interference. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
