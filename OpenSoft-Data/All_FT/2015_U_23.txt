(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Anil R. Dave, J.
1. We do not find any substance in these appeals. The civil appeals are dismissed.
2. However, looking at the peculiar facts of the case, to put a quietus to the litigation and to bring an end to all the claims made so far or which could have been made by the appellants, we direct that in all a sum of Rs.1 lakh (Rupees One Lakh only) be paid to Appellant No.1, Smt. Nirmal Verma, the widow of Late Shri S.K. Verma, by the respondent-Corporation by way of ex-gratia payment. The appellants shall not initiate any litigation against the respondent-Corporation in future.
3. It is clarified that dismissal of these appeals would not entitle the respondent-Corporation to recover the amount, if any, already paid to the appellant.
Order accordingly
