Executive Engineer, Punjab v Pargat Singh
Supreme Court of India

22 February 2005
C.A. No. 3464 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the appellant.
1.  By the impugned order the High Court has upheld the award made by the Labour Court directing the reinstatement of the respondent workman with back wages. The Labour Court came to the conclusion that the appellant while issuing the notice of retrenchment as contemplated under Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act neither gave one month's notice nor in lieu of the notice gave one month's salary which has been upheld by the High Court.
2. Learned counsel for the appellant is not able to satisfy us how the impugned orders of the Labour Court as well as the High Court are contrary to the law.
3.  In the said view of the matter we find no merit in this appeal. The appeal is dismissed accordingly.
Appeal dismissed.
