Vinod Kumar Shantilal Gosalia v Gangadhar and Others
Supreme Court of India

24 July 1980
C.As. Nos. 1440-1443 (N) of 1970.
The Judgment was delivered by: FAZAL ALI, J.
After having heard counsel for the parties we reserved judgment.
1. On going through the judgment of the Judicial Commissioner and the documents and after a careful consideration of the arguments of the parties, we find that these appeals involve a substantial question of law of great importance which likely to govern a number of cases arising out of mining leases in the present territory of Goa, Daman & Diu.
2. We, therefore, direct that this case be placed before a larger Bench. Let these appeals be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for orders.
Order Accordingly.
