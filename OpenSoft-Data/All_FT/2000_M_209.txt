Narain Cold Storage and Allied Ind. Pvt. Ltd v Messrs Delhi Finance Corporation
Supreme Court of India

24 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13518-13519/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1. Inspite of the concession of the counsel appearing for the petitioner before the High Court this Court proceeded to see if there was any agreement by the parties for simple interest and if any injustice was done in computing compound interest rather than simple interest.
2.  Elaborate arguments have been advanced before us on the last two occasions as well as today and we find that after the compromise on 6.4.77 in which it was mentioned 14% rate of interest will be charged, the Corporation was debiting compound interest every six months as per the account sheet produced in the Court and the compromise itself specifies that interest to be debited after every six months This is how the Corporation understood the terms of the compromise for over 10 years.
3. It is not possible to believe that the petitioner did not know the manner in which the Corporation was maintaining its accounts for over 10 years. The petitioner is a commercial concern and it must normally be presumed that it must be aware of the manner in which the Corporation is maintaining its accounts. At any rate as per commercial practice, interest statements would normally be sent to the clients after every six months or atleast once in a year. The petitioner has also not produced before us the manner in which it was maintaining its income tax accounts. It normally to be presumed that for the purpose of income tax, the petitioner must have got the Bank statements and known its contents and never complained against levy of compound interest.
For the aforesaid reasons and in view of the contemporaneous and subsequent conduct and particularly for the reason that Corporation was debiting compound interest for over 10 years, the SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
