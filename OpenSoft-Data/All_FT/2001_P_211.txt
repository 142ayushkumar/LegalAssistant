2.  Therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is justified. We, therefore, grant time till 31.12.2001, to the petitioners to vacate the premises on their filing usual undertaking in this Court within three weeks from today.
3. In case the respondents have any objection to this part of the order, it shall be open to them to apply for vacation of this order.
