DLF Universal Limited v Dipti Bhalla Verma and others
Supreme Court of India

19 February 2004
C.As. Nos. 6502-20 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal arises from an interim order passed by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission dated 25-9-1998. Broadly speaking, the dispute relates to the entitlement of the appellant to charge enhanced costs in respect of allotted flats. This Court had, by an order dated 18-1-1999, granted interim stay on the condition that those who have deposited/paid 75% of the extra charges as demanded by the appellant within three months, such complainants will deposit balance amount of 25% in this Court with the Registrar. On deposit of such amount, such persons would be entitled to get the possession. By a subsequent order dated 9-8-1999, this Court directed that
"the various amounts deposited by the complainants in this Court with the Registrar be invested in a fixed deposit with any nationalised bank for a period of one year and shall be renewed thereafter if the appeals are not heard".
2.  While there appear to have been some orders relating to the withdrawal of the amount deposited by the respondent on 8-1-2001 and 14-8-2003, the parties have now agreed that the appellant may withdraw the amount without prejudice to the rights and contentions of either party before the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission. Ordered accordingly.The civil appeals are disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
