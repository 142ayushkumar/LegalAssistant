The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  We have heard the learned counsel for the parties. These matters relate to regularisation and payment of wages to the respondents who were employed on daily wage basis. By the impugned judgment the Division Bench of the High Court, while affirming with modification the order passed by the learned single Judge has directed that all employees who have completed five years of continuous service should be considered for regularisation in accordance with the terms of G.O.Ms. No. 212 dated April 22, 1994 and that they should be paid their wages at par with the wages paid to the permanent employees of that category. As regards payment of wages there is no dispute between the parties that the same have to be paid from the date of regularisation.
2. In so far as regularisation is concerned, we are of the view that the High Court has rightly directed that on the basis of the Notification G.O.Ms. No. 212, the respondent employees shall be regularised will effect from the date or dates, they completed five years' continuous service.
3.  It is, however, made clear that the other conditions laid down in the said G.O.Ms. No. 212 will have to be satisfied for the purpose of regularisation. The special leave petitions are disposed of accordingly. No costs.
Petition disposed of.
