V. Gopal v Assistant Commissioner
Supreme Court of India

12 November 2002
Cr.A. Nos. 588-590 of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appellant was prosecuted on filing of complaint under provisions of section 276(c)(i) and section 277 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and under sections 193, 196 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Three complaints were filed in respect of three assessment years, namely, 1980-81, 1981-82 and 1982-83.
2. The applications filed by the appellant seeking discharge under section 245(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code were dismissed by learned Magistrate. The petition filed under section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code were also dismissed by the High Court. Hence, these appeals.
3.  In these appeals learned counsel seeks quashing of the proceedings in view of the subsequent events, namely, the order passed by the Tribunal on 29th June, 1995 setting aside the penalty proceedings and the order passed by the High Court on 21st January, 1997 declining reference of the Assessing Authority under section 256(1) of the Income-Tax Act.
4. We refrain from expressing any opinion about the effect of those orders on the complaint pending before the Magistrate. That was not the issue before the High Court nor was it before the Magistrate when applications for discharge were filed by the appellant. In case the appellant filed any application before the Magistrate on that ground, it will be decided by the learned Magistrate in accordance with law. Insofar as the impugned order is concerned, we find no infirmity, therefore, the appeals are dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
