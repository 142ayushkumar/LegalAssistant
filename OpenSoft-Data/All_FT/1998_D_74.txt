Dr. Paramjit Singh Ranu v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

1  May  1998
S.L.P. (C) No. 23360 of 1997 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 26 November 1997 in CW.P. No. 14337 of 1997 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh)
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  Our attention has been drawn to a news item which has appeared in the Chandigarh Newsline published by the Indian Express group from Chandigarh on 30-4-1998. The heading of the news item reads "SC orders removal of Homeo Council Chief'. The news item is based on the report of Mr. K. B. Kapur and has Ludhiana, April 29, as the date line
2.  Not only that, the heading of the news item is absolutely incorrect and misleading and even the contents are misleading. We take a very strong view of this matter. The newspaper has taken liberties with the order of the Court. The case referred to is being heard by the Bench
3.  A notice shall issue to the Reporter - Mr. K. B. Kapur, to be served through the Editor, Indian Express, Chandigarh; as well as to the Editor, Indian Express, Chandigarh, to show cause why proceedings for committing contempt of court be not initiated against them. The notice shall be made returnable within 10 days. Mr. R. S. Sodhi, learned counsel for the State of Punjab, is directed to have the notices served through the State Agency on Mr. Kapur and the Editor of the Indian Express at Chandigarh
List after 10 days. Registry to give the date.
Order Accordingly.
