State of Uttar Pradesh and others v Vinod Kumar
Supreme Court of India

18 February 2016
Civil Appeal No. 11405 of 2011
(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Anil R. Dave, J.
1. Heard the learned counsel for the appellant.
2. It is an admitted fact that the respondent was working as a daily wager Chawkidar and his services had been terminated in the year 1986. Looking at the fact that the respondent had hardly worked for one year and more particularly, in view of the fact that he had not been given appointment through employment exchange or by following regular procedure, we do not feel it proper to direct reinstatement with backwages.
3. Looking at the peculiar facts of the case, we direct the petitioners to pay Rs.1 Lakh (Rupees One Lakh only) to the respondent by way of compensation as a full and final settlement of his claim within two months from today. No further litigation on this subject shall be entertained by any Court thereafter.
4. In view of the above direction, the appeal is disposed of as partly allowed with no order as to costs.
Pending applications stand disposed of.
Appeal disposed of
