Rama Shankar v N.C.T. of Delhi
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3486/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  On perusal of the record and on consideration of the submissions made, we are of the view that the High Court was not right in rejecting the appellant's prayer for bail. It appears from the records that he has been in jail from the 28th September, 1991 and has completed more than 10 years in custody.
2. His conduct in jail has also been certified to be good. On the consideration of the matter, we set aside the order dated 2.8.2001 of the Delhi High Court in Criminal Misc.No.1701/2001 in Criminal Appeal No.319 of 2001 and direct release of the appellant on bail on executing a bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.
The appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
