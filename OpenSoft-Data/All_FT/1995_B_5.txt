Leave granted. Heard.
1.  We are satisfied that there was no ground available to the High Court for setting aside the trial court's order refusing to grant the injunction for holding the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of the company. We are informed that the extraordinary general meeting is scheduled to be held on March 30, 1995.
2. The injunction granted by the High Court is, therefore, vacated. Moreover, the appellants also undertake to circulate a copy of the letter dated January 7, 1995, annexure "B" to the shareholders who attend the extraordinary general meeting before commencement of the extraordinary general meeting.
The appeal is allowed in these terms. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
