Sunil Kumar Sinha v State of Bihar and another
Supreme Court of India

16 September 2002
Cr.A. No. 953 of 2002 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 90 of 2002)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In the instant case, during the trial for an offence alleged to have been committed under Section 302 IPC, Dinesh Singh, the respondent, was on bail. He was convicted by the Sessions Judge by order dated 1-10-1999 and thereafter, he was in custody. His application for bail was rejected by the High Court thrice, but, on further application being filed, the High Court directed that he should be released on bail, inter alia on the ground that there was no chance of the appeal being taken in the near future.
2.  With respect we deem it to be a highly improper approach to the point in issue. After a full-fledged trial, Dinesh Singh was convicted and sentenced under Section 302 IPC to undergo life imprisonment. It is open to the High Court to say which facts were such that merited Dinesh Singh getting bail. But, merely because the High Court is unable to hear the case in the near future would be no ground, by itself, for releasing the accused who has not even been in custody for three years.
3.  While allowing this appeal and setting aside the impugned order, we would like to impress upon the High Court to take up those appeals which are pending under Section 302 IPC, especially those where the accused are not on bail, on priority basis and dispose of them as expeditiously as possible.
4. It will be open to the accused in this case to apply to the High Court for bail on merit at a later date, which it goes without saying shall be considered in accordance with law.
The appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
