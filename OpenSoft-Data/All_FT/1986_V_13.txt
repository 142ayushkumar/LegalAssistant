Assistant District Registrar, Co-Operative Housing Society Limited and another v Vikrambhai Ratilal Dalal and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 November 1986
C.As. Nos. 2153 of 1972 and 5-7 of 1973.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The only question in this appeal is about the vires of Section 96(1)(c) of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961.
2. This provision has been struck down by a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court in Rasiklal Patel v. Kailasgauri Ramanlal Mehta.
3. We have perused the judgment of the Gujarat High Court and we are unable to find any justification for interfering with the view taken by the Gujarat High Court. We may also add that the decision of the Gujarat High Court has stood for sixteen years and many thousands of transactions must have taken place on the basis of correctness of this judgment.
4. We see no justification for interference in this case. The decision in Maganlal Chhagganlal (P) Ltd. v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay 1974 Indlaw SC 2701974 Indlaw SC 270, on which reliance was placed by learned counsel for the appellant has no relevance whatsoever. These appeals are accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeals disposed of.
