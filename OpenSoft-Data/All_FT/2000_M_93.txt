State of Rajasthan v Madan
Supreme Court of India

6 November 2000
Cr.A. No. 939 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The respondent was tried for an offence under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code on the allegation of having committed rape on a minor girl aged about 11 years. The occurrence took place on 2-3-1996. Vide judgment and order dated 28-6-1997 the trial court recorded an order of acquittal against the respondent. The appeal filed against acquittal by the State was dismissed by the High Court on 11-3-1999 on the ground of "inordinate delay". The delay in filing appeal before the High Court, as we notice from the record, was only of 31 days.
2.  We would not like to express any opinion on the merits of the case, but suffice it to notice that a perusal of the medical evidence as also the testimony of the prosecutrix, did warrant the High Court to examine the case on merits and not to dismiss it on the ground of delay of 31 days only. Keeping in view the unfortunate rise in crime against women and particularly minor children, the courts owe an obligation to the society to examine such cases with utmost sensitivity. In our opinion, the order of the High Court dismissing the appeal against acquittal on the ground of inordinate delay cannot be sustained, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case.
3. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the order of the High Court dated 11-3-1999 and remand the matter to the High Court for a fresh disposal in accordance with law. The High Court shall admit the appeal against acquittal to hearing and dispose of it on merits as expeditiously as possible.
Appeal allowed.
