State of Jharkhand and Anr v Citizens Cause and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15805/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Application for intervention is dismissed.
1.  On 8th August, 2001, the High Court recorded in its order which is under challenge:
"Be that as it may, since the Minister has now undertaken to vacate the house, we hereby direct that for a period of six weeks from today, our aforesaid two orders with respect to the aforesaid house shall not be implemented. The Minister, Urban Development, State of Jharkhand, shall vacate this House during this period."
2.  When this special leave petition reached hearing on 24th September, 2001, notice was ordered and it was stated:
"Having regard to the undertaking of the Minister concerned to vacate the house by 8th November, 2001, the order under challenge shall remain stayed insofar as that house is concerned."
3.  We are now told on behalf of the Minister concerned (and intervenor) that he has not vacated the premises. We think that it is appropriate to direct the High Court to proceed suo motu against Mr. Bachcha Singh, the Minister concerned, in contempt. Had there been any good reason not to vacate, an application to be relieved of the undertaking ought to have been filed within the period specified in our order, i.e., by 8th November, 2001.
4.  Having regard to the fact that the petition is by the State of Jharkhand, of which the intervenor is a Minister, the special leave petition is dismissed.
5.  This order shall be communicated to the Registrar General of the High Court at Jharkhand expeditiously for further action.
Petition dismissed.
