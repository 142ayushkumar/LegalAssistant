C.As. No. 432 of 2004 With Nos. 433-36 of 2004, 4131, 15649-52, 18534, 6069, 6071, 6072, 6073, 6086-87, 6074-77, 6080-81, 6083-85 of 2005, S.L.Ps. [(C) Nos. 9992-93 of 2005], 21685-701, 22621 of 2005, 5592, 5598, 5890 Of 2004, 24213-14 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This batch of appeals/S.L.Ps. involves an important issue regarding right of recovery of debts by the cooperative banks constituted under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912 of the States of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. The issue has arisen in the context of enactment of the Recovery Of Debts Due To Banks And Financial Institutions Act, 1993. Under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912 there is a mechanism for recovery of debts by the banks constituted under those Acts which are also called cooperative banks.
2. After the enactment of the Recovery Of Debts Due To Banks And Financial Institutions Act, 1993, question arose as to whether such cooperative banks would have the right of recovery under the respective Co-operative Societies Act, 1912 or they will have to proceed under the Recovery Of Debts Due To Banks And Financial Institutions Act, 1993. These aspects and some other issues, includes the issue of legislative competence of the States to enact the provisions relating to cooperative banks, came up for consideration before the Bombay High Court and the High Court Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad. Both the High Courts have pronounced judgments on the issues and these judgments are under appeal in these cases. Looking to the issues involved and the far-reaching consequences which such a decision will leave, we are of the view that these matters be decided by a larger Bench.
3.  It has also been brought to our notice that as a consequence of the impugned judgments of the two High Courts, recoveries worth thousands of crores of rupees are held up and for that reason these matters need to be decided as early as possible.
4.  Let these matters be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriate larger Bench for early disposal of these cases.
5.  We are informed that so far as the batch of appeals/S.L.Ps. arising from the judgment of the Bombay High Court is concerned, the stay applications have already been disposed off. The stay applications in the appeals/S.L.Ps. arising from the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court are yet to be finally disposed off. Let the stay applications in the matter arising from the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court be placed before this Court on Wednesday, 7th December, 2005. If any party is desirous of filing any reply, the same be filed by Monday, 5th December, 2005.
Delay condoned.
Issue notice.
6.  Dasti service, in addition to the usual mode of service, is also permitted.
Order accordingly.
