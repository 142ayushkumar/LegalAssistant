Khemchand Om Prakash Sharma v State of Gujarat and Another
Supreme Court of India

25 February 2000
Cr.A. No. 234 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The short question that arises for consideration in this appeal is whether the respondent Jasumatiben, who claimed maintenance, being the wife of the applicant, can be allowed any maintenance on the admitted position that the applicant's first wife is alive and there has been no annulment of marriage by a decree of divorce or otherwise. During the subsistence of the first marriage, any second marriage is null and void, and therefore, the courts below committed a mistake in granting maintenance in favour of Jasumatiben, who claimed maintenance as the second wife of the applicant.
2. We, therefore, set aside the grant of maintenance in favour of Jasumatiben alone. Needless to mention the children, namely, Trupti and Vaishali will continue to get maintenance, as directed. The appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
