State of Uttar Pradesh v Mandleshwar Singh
Supreme Court of India

29 January 1987
S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 2761 of 1985 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 14 May 1985 of the High Court of Allahabad in Habeas Borpus Petition No. 2052 of 1985)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. In this matter the detention order has been quashed in May 1985. This special leave petition is coming up more than 1 1/2 years after the quashing of the order and in a way it has become irrelevant if not infructuous. When we pointed out this aspect to learned counsel for the petitioner it was stated that such a situation is faced in a large number of matters and even when the decision of the High Court is erroneous and unsustainable on merits it is not possible to get a decision of this Court to settle the law since we are reluctant to entertain such a petition more than one-and-a-half years after the detention order was quashed.
2. In the result the point would always remain unresolved and the matter could never be set right. When it was pointed out that counsel should seek an order for listing the matter at an early date by mentioning before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India, counsel requested that the matter may be placed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India to bring this aspect to focus in order to seek appropriate directions to overcome such a situation in matters of this nature.
3. Accordingly, we direct that this matter may be listed before the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India for admission.
Order accordingly.
