Heard parties.
1.  This Appeal is against the Order dated 5th February 2004 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. By this Order delay of 29 days in filing Revision has not been condoned and the Revision has been dismissed.
2.  We are of the view that sufficient cause had been disclosed for condoning a small delay of 29 days. We therefore set aside the Order of the National Commission and remit the matter back to the National Commission. The delay shall stand condoned.
3.  The National Commission shall dispose of the Revision on its merits in accordance with the principles laid down by this Court in Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65 2004 Indlaw SC 941.
The Appeal stands allowed accordingly. No order as to costs.
