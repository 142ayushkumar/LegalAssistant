Cr.A. No. 495 of 2001 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 1124 of 2001)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant has been convicted under Section 22, of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as "the NDPS Act") and was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years, on the allegation that he illegally possessed 3 ampoules each containing 2 ml of buprenorphine.
2.  In the light of the decision of this Court in Hussain v. State of Kerala 1999 Indlaw SC 1575 no person can be convicted for possessing 3 ampoules of buprenorphine. It is unnecessary to narrate the reasons because the said judgment contains all the reasons.
3. We therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence passed on him. He is directed to be set at liberty forthwith unless he is required in any other case.
Appeal allowed.
