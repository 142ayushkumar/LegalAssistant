Muppa Sankara Rao v State of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

9 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3325/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Appellant was convicted under Section 511 read with Section 376 of the IPC. He is sentenced to undergo RI for three and a half years. This appeal is confined to the question whether the conviction can be altered to section 354.
2. Since it is admitted that no rape has been committed the maximum that can be inferred from the fact situation is that appellant had used force and thereby outraged the modesty of the victim. Hence the offence can be brought down within the purview of Section 354 of the IPC. We do so.
3.  We are told that the appellant and the prosecutrix have come to terms and an application for compounding the offence has been filed. Permission is granted for compounding the same.
4. We, therefore, acquit the appellant under Section 320(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
