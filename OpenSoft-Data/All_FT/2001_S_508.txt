G. Kumar v State of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

19 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 611/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant in this case has been convicted under Section 338 of the Indian Penal Code. He was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/-. He filed an appeal but the same was dismissed while confirming the conviction and sentence passed on him. The High Court did not interfere in revision.
2. We are told that the appellant had already been in jail in connection with this case for a period of about 3 months. The plea is made that the imprisonment part of sentence may be reduced to the period he has already undergone.
3.  In view of the fact that the conviction is only of the offence under Section 338 of the Indian Penal Code we are amenable to agree to the said submission.
4.  We, therefore, reduce the imprisonment part of the sentence to the period already undergone by the appellant.
The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
