Messrs Hind Lamps Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax, U.P.
Supreme Court of India

30 January 1987
C.A. No. 1398 (NT) of 1974
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The following question came up for consideration before the High Court of Allahabad u/s. 256(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, (hereinafter called the 'Act').Whether on the facts and in the facts and in the circumstances of the case, it was rightly held that:
(1) proposed dividends,
(2) provision for taxation
(3) credit balance of profit and loss account
(4) depreciation reserve (being excess of book depreciation over depreciation allowed in the income tax assessment) represented 'reserves' and were to be included in the computation of capital under the Super Profits Tax Act, 1963?
2.  The High Court by its judgment and order dated December 23, 1971 answered the question on the different items. The High Court was of the view that the four items, namely, (1) proposed dividends, (2) provision for taxation, (3) credit balance of profit and loss accounts and (4) depreciation reserve, that is, excess of book depreciation over depreciation allowed in the income tax assessment did not represent reserves and should not be included in the computation of capital under the Super Profits Tax Act, 1963 and answered the question in the negative is favour of the assessee.
3.  The assessee came up in appeal before us. So far as the items called proposed dividends, provision for taxation and credit balance of profit and loss account are concerned in view of the decision of this Court in Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. CIT, 1981 Indlaw SC 3911981 Indlaw SC 3911981 Indlaw SC 391 and the decision in CIT v. Century Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., 1953 Indlaw SC 231953 Indlaw SC 231953 Indlaw SC 23, the questions answered in the favour of the revenue by the High Court must be held to have been rightly answered.
4. So far only item No. 4, that is to say, depreciation reserve (being excess of book depreciation over depreciation allowed in the income tax assessment) is concerned, a sum of Rs. 2, 23, 185 which was described as depreciation reserve, it was found by the High Court that it was the excess of the book depreciation over the income tax depreciation allowed. The High Court found that there was no evidence that this was put to any future use. There is no evidence that this was meant to be or intended to be put up for use in future. If that is the position, then it cannot be said that these formed part of the reserve even though they were in excess of the actual depreciation allowed by the Income Tax Act, unless there is a conscious decision to set apart a certain amount for future use, it cannot be called reserve.
5.  So far as the depreciation reserve is concerned, it is not quite clear as to how this amount was treated. In view of the position in law as discussed by the authorities mentioned before us as well as in CIT v. Elgin Mills Ltd., 1986 Indlaw SC 8191986 Indlaw SC 3571986 Indlaw SC 819, we remand the case back to High Court with a direction to remand the matter back to the Tribunal to find out as to how this reserve was dealt with by the assessee, as was done in the case of Vazir Sultan Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. CIT, 1981 Indlaw SC 3911981 Indlaw SC 3911981 Indlaw SC 391.
6. The question therefore is answered by saying that the High Court was right so far as the proposed dividends, provisions for taxation, credit balance of profit and loss account was concerned and so far as item depreciation reserve is concerned, the matter is remanded back to the High Court in the manner indicated above, with no order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
