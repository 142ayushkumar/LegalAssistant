Tata Chemicals Limited v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

24 August 2000
S.L.P. (C) Nos. 9423-32 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Amendment allowed.
1.  The office report draws our attention to order dated 11 -5-2000 in SLPs (C) Nos. 8203-212 of 2000, (Saurashtra Chemicals Ltd. v. Union of India 2000 Indlaw SC 3483 filed against the judgment and order dated 21-1-2000, of CEGAT. In the said order, the SLPs were dismissed with the observations that the orders of the designated authority were recommendatory; that an appeal lay against the determination; and that determination had yet to be made by the Central Government.
2.  Mr Chidambaram draws our attention to the appeal which was filed before Cegat. The said appeal was filed not only against the determination of the designated authority but was filed also against the Customs Notification dated 27-10-1998, whereby anti-dumping duty was imposed. This aspect was apparently not brought to the notice of this Court when it passed the order dated 11-5-2000, and the order of cegat itself does not refer to the Customs Notification dated 27-10-1998, and that is why, probably, the Court was led to believe that the appeal had been filed before the issuance of the notification of determination.
3. It is clear from the facts brought to our notice that determination as contemplated by Rule 18, had taken place with the issuance of the Notification dated 27-10-1998, and, therefore, an appeal under Section 9-C, would be maintainable to Cegat. Issue notice returnable after four weeks. Dasti service, in addition, is permitted.
Order accordingly.
