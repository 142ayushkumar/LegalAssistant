State of Uttar Pradesh v Jagdish Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

26 April 1988
Cr.A. no. 291 of 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave to appeal is granted.
1.  This Court has observed before, in more than one case, that when the High Court disposes of a criminal appeal it should set forth the reasons, even though briefly, in its order. That is a requirement necessitated by the plainest considerations of justice.
2.   We are constrained to remark that the repeated observations of this Court have not received the attention which they deserve. The impugned order before us does not disclose the reasons for making it. We trust that it will not be necessary for us to make these observations in any future case.
3.  The impugned order dated March 27, 1987 of the High Court is set aside and the case is remanded to the High Court for a fresh hearing of a appeal to be followed by an order setting forth the reasons therefore.
4.  The respondents shall be released on bail forthwith to the satisfaction of the learned Special Sessions Judge, Muzaffarnagar. It will be open to the High Court to make such further orders as it considers necessary in regard to the continuation of bail or cancellation of bail to the accused.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
