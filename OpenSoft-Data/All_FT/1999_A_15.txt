State of Andhra Pradesh v A. P. State Road Transport Corporation
Supreme Court of India

29 September 1999
C.As. Nos. 367-78 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appellant is the State of Andhra Pradesh. The respondent is the A.P State Road Transport Corporation. The respondent is wholly owned by the appellant.
2. The dispute is in regard to the sale by the respondent of old tyres, tubes and the like. According to the appellant, the respondent is liable to pay sales tax on such sales. According to the respondent, it carries on no business and therefore, is not liable to pay.
3.  To our mind, this is a waste of the Court's time, given that the appellant wholly owns the respondent. It will benefit, in real terms, neither the appellant nor the respondent, whichever way we decide.
4.  We note that the issue no longer survives because the law stands amended with effect from 1996. We also note that this is the only matter before us and that there is no material to indicate that any matter pertaining to a private assessee has not been disposed of because the decision on these appeals is awaited.
The appeals are adjourned by twelve weeks and the Court expect then to be told that they have been settled between the owner and the owned, namely, the appellant and the respondent.
The appeals shall now not be listed before a Constitution Bench.
Order accordingly.
