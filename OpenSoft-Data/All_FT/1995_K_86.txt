Koyana Pre-Stressed Products Private Limited v Collector of Central Excise
Supreme Court of India

1 November 1995
C.A. No. 6407 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Order which was controverted in the submissions of the department also. Therefore, contends the learned counsel for the assessee, the Tribunal had committed an error in observing that the assessee had not controverted the findings of the Collector. That is not accurate. We think that there is justification for this contention. We therefore, deem it appropriate to remit the matter to the Tribunal for a decision on this question.
2.  The further contention of the learned Counsel for the assessee was that when the Tribunal was remitting the entire matter, it ought not to have foreclosed its contention based on the proviso to Section 11A of the Act. We do not propose to go into this contention.
3. Since we are remitting the matter to the Tribunal on the question whether the Collector was right in concluding that the assessee was guilty of suppression and wilful mis-statement, the further order that the Tribunal may have to pass would be dependent upon the conclusion that it may reach on this issue.
4.  We allow this appeal and remit the matter to the Tribunal on the aforementioned short question. Since the issue is short, we hope the Tribunal will be able to give priority to the matter and dispose it of at an early date so that the matter which is remitted to the Collector may not get delayed.
5.  We were not called upon and do not interfere with any other part of the order.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
