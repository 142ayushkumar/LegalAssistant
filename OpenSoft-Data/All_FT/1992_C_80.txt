Commissioner of Income Tax v Ram Laxman Sugar Mills
Supreme Court of India

16 January 1992
C.A. No. 100 of 1977
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal by the Commissioner of Income-tax relates to a decision of the High Court pertaining to the assessment year 1957-58. The objection is to the disallowances of a sum of Rs. 28,422 paid to the members of a management board appointed to manage the affairs of a firm for some time, under section 10(4) (b) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.
2.   Having regard to the small sum involved, the huge lapse of time, and the fact that the assessee-firm was having as many as nine partners, we do not consider it necessary to express our opinion on a question which is not of recurring importance, and was decided on the special facts of the case. We, therefore, dismiss the civil appeal with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
