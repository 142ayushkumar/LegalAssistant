State of West Bengal and Others v Nirmal Kumar Sarkar and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.21298/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the petitioners.
1.  The submission is that the High Court by inadvertence referred to the impugned order to be dated 15.9.98 which on the face of it is incorrect. The submission is, on account of this the consideration of appeal and the observation that there was no explanation for the six months is not sustainable.
2.  We feel, if this be the fact, the proper course open for the petitioners is to move for review in the High Court. In view of this, this special leave petition is dismissed.
3. However, this is without prejudice of the rights of the petitioners to seek its remedy, if any, before appropriate forum.
Petition dismissed.
