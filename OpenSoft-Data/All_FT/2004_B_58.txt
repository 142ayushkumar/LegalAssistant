Balpatil and another v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

29 July 2004
C.A. No. 4730 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The National Commission for Minorities (for short "the Commission") constituted under the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 (for short "the Act") made its recommendations on 3-10-1994, to the Government of India to include "Jain" community in the notification dated 23-10-1993 issued u/s. 2(c) of the Act.
2. Since no action was taken by the Union of India on the recommendations made by the Commission, the appellants filed Writ Petition No.5009 of 1997, in the High Court of Bombay, seeking a mandamus, directing the Government to include the Jain community in the notification dated 23-10-1993. The said writ petition was disposed of by the High Court on 20-10-1997, observing that:
"Heard. Mr Chandrachud, the learned counsel for the petitioners made a limited grievance that the Minority Commission had recommended the status of minority to the Jain community. According to him the decision is to be taken by the Government in its Cabinet meeting. He further stated that the matter is pending since long.In view of this, we direct the Central Government to take the decision in the matter expeditiously and as early as possible having regard to the significance of the question involved. With this direction, the petition is disposed of."
3. In spite of the directions given by the High Court, no decision was taken by the Central Government.
4. Aggrieved by such inaction on the part of the Government, the appellants again filed Writ Petition No. 4066 of 1998 in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
5. The Union of India in its counter-affidavit took the stand that the point raised in the writ petition was pending for consideration in the Supreme Court in T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka 2002 Indlaw SC 1375. It was averred that the question could not be adjudicated upon and decided in haste and/or in a time- bound schedule. However, in the light of decision of the Apex Court in the matter of T.M.A. Pai Foundation 2002 Indlaw SC 1375  and after considering the protest notes of the Jain community itself on the matter in issue, as well as the protest notes of the Members of Parliament, a conscientious decision would be taken in relation to the matter in issue on its own merits and in accordance with law. That the Government was unable to take a final decision till T.M.A. Pai Foundation case 2002 Indlaw SC 1375 was decided by this Court.
6. The High Court disposed of the writ petition by the impugned order by observing:
"Having regard to the aforesaid averments contained in the affidavit-in-reply, more particularly the assertion that a conscientious decision will be taken in relation to the issue at hand after the decision of the Apex Court in the matter of T.M.A. Pai Foundation 2002 Indlaw SC 1375 we do not find that any useful purpose will be served by keeping the present petition pending.
Present petition, in the circumstances is accordingly disposed of. All the contentions raised in the present petition are kept open."
7. T.M.A. Pai Foundation case 2002 Indlaw SC 1375  was disposed of by the Constitution Bench on 31-10-2002. The High Court disposed of that writ petition.
8. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation case 2002 Indlaw SC 1375  the point raised in this appeal was neither raised nor decided. A final decision has now to be taken by the Government on the aforesaid recommendations made by the Commission.
9. Since the recommendations are pending for consideration before the Central Government for the last ten years and a final decision has to be taken, we adjourn this case to enable the Government to take a final decision on the point within four months from today. It is made clear that no further time shall be granted to the Union of India.
10. To be listed in the second week of December 2004.
Order accordingly.
