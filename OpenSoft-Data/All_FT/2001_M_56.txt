M. Soundrapandiyan v C. Edward and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1175/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.
1.  The learned counsel has pointed out that in the main judgment , the Court has specifically observed that because of the efflux of time, the Court was not proposing to initiate criminal proceedings in a criminal court against the petitioner.
2.  However, some erroneous noting is made after the end of judgment in the true copy given to the petitioner to the following effect:
"Disposing of the petition with observations to direct the respondents 2 to 6 to register a crime case against the first respondent etc., as stated within."
3.  Prima facie it appears that there is some substance in what is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner. However for this purpose this petition is not required to be entertained as it is open to the petitioner to approach the High Court for appropriate correction. Hence this petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
