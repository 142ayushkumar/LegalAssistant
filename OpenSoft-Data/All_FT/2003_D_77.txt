New India Assurance Company Limited v Dhirendra Nath Saha and Another
Supreme Court of India

7 October 2003
C.A. No.6285/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard parties.
1.  This appeal is against an order of the High Court dated 17th December, 1999. Briefly stated, the facts are that an accident took place on 6th February, 1986 whereunder a 25 year old boy was killed. Initially a claim was filed, before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal by the father of the boy i.e. the first Respondent (herein).
2. However, subsequently, the mother of the boy was also added as a claimant. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal awarded to both the claimants a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- with interest at the rate of 10% p.a.
3.  An appeal was filed by the appellants before the High Court. In that appeal the mother was not made a party. It appears that this fact was not noticed by the High Court. However, the High Court has dismissed the appeal on merits.
4. This appeal has been filed against that judgment. In this appeal also the mother, who was one of the original claimant, has not been made a party.
5.  In our view, in the absence of a necessary party, this appeal cannot be entertained. Even if we find merit in this Appeal and were inclined to modify this Award, we could only do it qua the father. The Award, which is joint, would stand, qua the mother.
6. Thus, entertaining this appeal would mean that there could be conflicting awards. This cannot be permitted. It would also be an exercise in futility. The Award qua the mother has become final. She can always execute it and recover the entire sum of Rs.5,00,000 Lacs with interest thereon.
7.  Therefore, we dismiss this appeal on the ground that a necessary party is not before the High Court. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
