Union of India v Baijnath Melaram
Supreme Court of India

24 July 1997
C.A. No. 7233 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
We have heard learned Counsel for the parties.
1. Having regard to the facts of this particular case which goes to show that the Vessel in question was with the Indian Navy and it was purchased by the respondent through M.S.T.C. Ltd. and it cannot be said that the ship after its export has been reimported into India, we do not therefore find any merit in this appeal.
The same is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
