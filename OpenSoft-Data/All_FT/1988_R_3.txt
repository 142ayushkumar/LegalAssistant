Supreme Court of India

30 November 1988
C.A. No. 4222 of 1988 (Appeal Arising out of S.L.P. No. 11848 of 1988)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Having regard to the scope of this appeal and having considered the report of the Special Officer, dated 13-11-1988, made pursuant to the order of this Court, we are of the opinion that the scheme supported by the workers and unsecured creditors of Raj Kumar Nemani, be accepted and a detailed scheme on that basis be formulated. It is desirable that the scheme be implemented as soon as possible and the workers and the creditors should be paid in accordance with the scheme approved today.
2. Further, the appeal is disposed of with a direction to work out the scheme by the learned Company Judge, Calcutta High Court, who is seized of the matter. It is contended by some of the secured creditors that by the operation of the scheme, the assets of the secured creditors should not be allowed to be affected. This contention of the secured creditors may be agitated before the Company Judge, if they are so entitled. All intervention applications are dismissed without prejudice to their rights, if any, to applicants to move the Company Judge, Calcutta High Court.
3.  We express our appreciation of the work of the Special Officer and on the report he has submitted. The remuneration of the Special Officer is fixed at Rs.5500/- and is to be paid out of the assets of the Company. The orders of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench are modified to the aforesaid extent.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
