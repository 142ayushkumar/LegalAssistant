Dresser Rand, S. A v K. G. Khosla Compressors Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 February 1994
S.L.P. (C) No. 3897 of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The interim order of the High Court purports to injunct the petitioner who is defendant 1 in the two from taking any steps in arbitration for the purpose of adjudication of the dispute which is the subject-matter of the suit.
2.  In a matter of this nature where questions of amenability of a dispute to international arbitration arise it is not proper to let loose and keep at large orders of injunction of this kind for unduly long periods. It is inconsistent with the principles governing international arbitration.
3.   It is of utmost importance for the domestic courts to be circumspect in granting such interlocutory interdictions. At any rate, the court must ensure that the matters are dealt with and disposed of with utmost despatch.
4.  We, therefore, request the High Court to dispose of the question whether the injunction should be vacated or not most expeditiously. Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the matter, we request the High Court to dispose of this question within two months from today.
The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
