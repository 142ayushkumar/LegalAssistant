Limited notice was given at the time of admission on the following questions whether the land in dispute which is a solitary plot surrounded by the Ansal properties could be put to any meaningful use and shows the planning development?

"Release of contracted portion of area from acquisition would be proper."
2. Learned senior counsel for the appellant submits that these aspects require to be considered.
3.  After hearing learned counsel for the respondents, we are of the view that on these limited aspects, there should be fresh consideration by the High Court of the writ petition.

The matters are remitted to the High Court for disposal of the writ petition in regard to this limited question.
