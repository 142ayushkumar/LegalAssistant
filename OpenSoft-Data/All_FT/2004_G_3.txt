State of Andhra Pradesh v G. Bhaskar Reddy and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 April 2004
Cr.A.No. 466 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is an appeal preferred by the State against the judgment of a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. Fourteen accused were tried by the Sessions Court for offences under Sections 147, 148, 448, 302 r/w 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Sessions Court found A-1, A-5 and A-9 guilty of offence punishable under Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and A-2, A-4, A-10 and A-12 guilty of offence under Section 302 r/w 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860. A-6 to A-8, A-13 and A-14 were acquitted of all charges framed against them.
2. The High Court found A-1, the first accused, guilty of offence under Section 304 Part-I Indian Penal Code, 1860 instead of Section 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for a period of seven years. The other accused were also sentenced for various imprisonments for various minor offences. The finding of the High Court is challenged before us.
3.  We have heard learned counsel for the State as also Mr.V.R. Reddy, learned senior counsel for the respondents. Learned counsel for the State submitted that all the accused came to the residence of the deceased and attacked the deceased as well as other inmates of the house and caused serious injuries and that there was an unlawful assembly and all the accused were liable to be convicted under Section 302 read with 149 Indian Penal Code, 1860.
4.  We have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the prosecution. "The Division Bench considered the medical evidence adduced in this case and held that the fatal injury might have been caused by the first accused and there was no evidence to show that all other accused have shared the common object in causing death of the deceased and that there was any unlawful assembly."
5. Learned counsel for the respondents also pointed out from the medical evidence that for the serious internal injury, there was no corresponding external injury mentioned and, therefore, it might have been caused by a blunt weapon and, in view of this medical evidence, it is not possible to attribute the involvement of all other accused in this case.
6.  Having considered the material on record and having in mind the fact that this being an appeal against acquittal, we do not think that the State has made out a case for interference with the impugned judgment.
The appeal, accordingly, fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
