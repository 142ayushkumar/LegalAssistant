Supreme Court of India

15 December 1999
Cr.A. No. 1364 of 1999 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 3454 of 1999)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellants have been convicted under Sections 302/149 Indian Penal Code, 1860 by the learned Sessions Judge and have been sentenced to imprisonment for life. Against the said conviction and sentence their appeal to the High Court is pending. Before the High Court application for suspension of sentence and bail was filed but the High Court rejected that prayer indicating therein that the applicants can renew their prayer for bail after one year. After the expiry of one year the second application was filed but the same has been rejected by the impugned order. It is submitted that the appellants are already in jail for over 3 years and 3 months. There is no possibility of early hearing of the appeal in the High Court.
In the aforesaid circumstances the applicants be released on bail to the satisfaction of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Sehore. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
