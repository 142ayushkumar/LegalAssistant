Shehnaz Mudbhatkal v Arvind Ramakrishna and Another
Supreme Court of India

15  May  1998
S.L.P. (C) No. 5968 of 1998 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 12 March 1998 in LPA No. 46 of 1998 in W.P. No. 374 of 1998 of the High Court of Bombay)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is a transfer application. The petitioner herein is the wife and the first respondent, the husband. The cause between the parties initially was before the 4th Family Court, Bandra, but at a point of time was transferred to the 7th Family Court. Proceedings before the 7th Family Court remained stagnant because there was no Presiding Judge. The position continues to be the same. The Principal Family Court then transferred the case to the 4th Family Court. The petitioner has certain grievances against the functioning of the 4th Family Court when the matter was before it. Certain unfounded allegations have been made against the Presiding Judge of that Court.
2. The a apprehensions of the petitioner that she will not get justice there, are without any basis. All the same, since the family matters are sensitive in character and the Judges of the Family Courts have to play a greater participatory role, that objective can only be achieved if a rapport is established by the Judges of such court with the parties concerned. In these circumstances, we leave it to the Judge concerned whether he would prefer to keep hearing this matter or recommend a transfer to another Family Court within the same jurisdiction. We leave that option to the learned Judge. Having remarked thus, we dispose of this special leave petition.
Petition disposed of.
