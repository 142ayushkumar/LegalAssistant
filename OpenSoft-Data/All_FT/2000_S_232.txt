Sonu v Prakash
Supreme Court of India

25 February 2000
Transfer Petition No. 53 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is a petition for transfer of a divorce petition filed by the respondent husband before the Family Court, Bangalore. The petitioner is the wife and she is residing at Udaipur and hence she prays that the divorce petition pending in the Bangalore Family Court be transferred to the Family Court at Udaipur.
2.  The respondent has appeared in person. He is not disputing the prayer of the petitioner that the case must be transferred to Udaipur as he also admits that the petitioner is a resident of Udaipur. All that he prays for is that a direction may be given to the Family Court of Udaipur to post the case on a day-to-day basis when he reaches Udaipur so that the petition can be disposed of.
3. We feel that the said prayer is very reasonable considering the very far distance he has to cover for prosecuting the divorce petition.
4.  In the result we allow this petition and order transfer of MC No. 479 of 1988 from the Family Court, Bangalore to the Family Court at Udaipur. We make a direction to the Judge of the Family Court that the day when the respondent husband appears for prosecuting his petition, the same shall be posted thereafter on a day-to-day basis until the evidence is closed and the petition shall be disposed of in the same rhythm. This is to afford relief to the respondent who has otherwise to travel long distance on account of the transfer granted as per this order.
Transfer petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
