International Electron Devices Private Limited v Collector of Central Excise
Supreme Court of India

21 August 1995
C.A. Nos. 6875-80 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In the Tribunal's order, the Tribunal has quoted with approval the statement of fact in the order of the Collector to the effect that one of the requirements of Rule 56 C, namely, holding of a licence both by the primary manufacturer and the secondary manufacturer is an essential requirement and that in this case no material was produced to show that the primary manufacturer was holding central excise licence.
2.  Learned counsel for the appellant says that both the primary and secondary manufacturers did possess central excise licences at the relevant time and that the said licences were also produced before the Tribunal but that the Tribunal has failed to notice the same.
3. Learned counsel further says that with effect from March 1986, Rule 56 C does not operate and the Notification No. 214/86 requires merely filing a letter and that this requirement was fulfilled in February 1988 which is a sufficient compliance. He says that this point was also argued before the Tribunal but that the Tribunal has not dealt with the same.
4.  If these are the contentions of the learned counsel, it is open to him to approach the Tribunal and invite its attention to the said circumstances and ask for appropriate orders according to law. We express no opinion on the correctness or otherwise of the said contentions.
With the above observations, the appeals are disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
