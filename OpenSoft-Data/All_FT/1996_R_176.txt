Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited v Seva Singh and another
Supreme Court of India

18 July 1996
C.As. Nos. ... of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 9334-39 of 1996) with S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 13395-400 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Civil Appeals Nos.... of 1996 (arising out of SLPs (C) Nos.9334-39 of 1996)
Special leave granted.
2.  Heard counsel on both sides. Admittedly, the role attributed to the respondents was that they had instigated the illegal strike. There is no doubt that the strike was illegal. There is also no doubt that the respondents had participated in the strike. Even if the High Court felt that the punishment of dismissal from service was harsh, we fail to appreciate how the management can be directed to pay 50% by way of back wages for the fault of the respondents.
3. We think that the loss of wages for the period in question should be a sufficient lesson to the respondents not to indulge in such activities in future. If they do so, it would be taken as an aggravated misconduct and may have to be dealt with accordingly. We, therefore, modify the order by directing the deletion of the direction regarding payment of 50% back wages. The appeals will stand disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs. The order of reinstatement may be implemented within a month's time.
SLPs (C) Nos.13395-400 of 1996
4.  In view of the order passed in civil appeals arising from SLPs (C) Nos.9334-39 of 1996, these petitions will stand disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
