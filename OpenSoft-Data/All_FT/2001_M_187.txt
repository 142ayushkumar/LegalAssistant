Managing Director, A.P.S.R.T v K Venkata Krishnaiah
Supreme Court of India

26 September 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3317/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Respondent's father who was a Driver in the Establishment of the appellants died on 20.12.1986 while still in employment. On his death an application was made by the respondent for appointment on compassionate grounds. The appellants not having appointed him, he filed a writ petition before the High court.
2. The High Court after examining the Scheme applicable directed that the appellants should provide an employment to the respondent if necessary by creating a supernumerary post of cleaner or any suitable post within three months from the date of receipt of the order, if he is otherwise qualified and in accordance with the circulars in force.
Hence this appeal.
3.  The grievance made on behalf of the appellants is that there are difficulties in creation of new posts particularly to the post of a Cleaner or any other post.
4.  All that they can do is to include the name of the Respondent in the appropriate waiting list meant for compassionate appointment and give him a suitable appointment on priority basis. We think the suggestion made on behalf of the appellants is reasonable and the view taken by the High Court in giving a direction to create a supernumerary post cannot be sustained at all in the light of our several earlier judgments, including, in the case of A.P.S.R.T.C.and  Ors.Vs. Kaiser Begum 1997 Indlaw SC 1251.
5. Hence the order of the High Court is modified and this appeal is allowed in part as stated above.
Appeal allowed.
