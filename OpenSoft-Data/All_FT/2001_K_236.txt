Messrs National Fertilizers Limited and Others v Kulbhushan Singh
Supreme Court of India

19 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.2484/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Respondent was appointed as early as on 12th April 1991 and after he was relegated to remedy of Civil Suit by the High Court, where he had filed a writ petition (Civil Writ Petition No.2822 of 1997) complaining of refusal to release his full salary; he filed a suit for mandatory injunction for release of full salary before the learned Civil Judge, Junior Division, Jagadhri, which was decreed on 5th June 1999.
2. First Appeal filed by the petitioner failed on 4th May 2000 and the Second Appeal filed by the petitioner also met the same fate with the High Court holding that no substantial question of law was involved in the second appeal.
3.  In these facts and circumstances, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order through this special leave petition. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed. We, however do not express any opinion on the question of law raised by the petitioner.
Petition dismissed.
