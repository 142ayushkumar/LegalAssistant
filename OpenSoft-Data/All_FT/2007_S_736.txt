The appellant subsequently surrendered and has suffered custody for more than two years.
6.  The position in law as to what happens in case of acquittal of similarly placed co-accused on the same set of facts and on similar accusations has been considered by this Court in several cases.
7.  A departure may be made in cases where the accused had not surrendered after the conviction in addition to not filing an appeal against the conviction. But as in the present case, after surrender, the benefit of acquittal in the case of co-accused on similar accusations can be extended.
8.  The appeal is allowed and conviction and sentence as recorded by the trial court and upheld by the High Court is set aside.
Appeal allowed.
