5. We may add that Mr. L. N. Sinha, learned counsel appearing for the Union of India in all these case, sought the permission of the court to urge a ground in respect of the interpretation of Article 371-D of the Constitution of India, 1950. he contended that the power of judicial review, even construed as a basic feature of the Constitution, was not precluded by the provisions of Article 371-D of the Constitution of India, 1950 and therefore the judgment of this Court called for review. We are not satisfied, however, that we should interfere6. The review petitions are disposed of accordingly
