Bandhua Mukti Morcha and another v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 September 1986
W.P. Nos. 12125 of 1984 and 11643 of 1985
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  We find that the State of Uttar Pradesh has not yet filed the lists setting out the particulars of the criminal cases which have been filed against the carpet manufacturers and are pending trial in the courts, even though the State Government was directed to do so within four days from the date of our order dated August 18, 1986.
2.  The State Government has also not put forward any scheme for rehabilitation of the children employed in the carpet manufacturing industry. We have directed the State Government to do so and an assurance was given to us that the needful will be done by the State Government within a short time. It is a matter of regret that the orders made by this Court should be blatantly flouted by the State Government. It looks as if the State Government is not interested at all in eliminating child labour in the carpet manufacturing industry though the said child labour is prohibited under the Employment of Children Act, 1938, no does the State Government seem to be interested in providing for the rehabilitation of the said children.
3.  We would give one final opportunity to the State Government and adjourn the writ petition to September 29, 1986 and direct the Secretary to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, Labour Department to remain present in court at 10.30 a. m. to answer why the directions given by this Court have not yet been carried out.
Order accordingly.
