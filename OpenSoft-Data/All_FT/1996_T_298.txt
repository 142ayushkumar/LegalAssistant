Tripura State Cooperative Union Limited and Another v Bimal Kanti Bhattacharjee and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 April 1996
C.A. No. ... of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 5204 of 1995)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Leave granted.
2. The Respondent 1 was appointed as a contingent worker on the post of Photographer-cum-Clerk with the Tripura State Cooperative Union Limited, Appellant 1 (hereinafter referred to as "the Cooperative Union") on 25-6-1986. He was being paid a fixed amount of Rs. 600 per month. In May 1992 he filed writ petition (Civil Rule No. 129 of 1992) in the Gauhati High Court, Agartala Bench, seeking the relief of equal pay for equal work on the ground that photographers in other government departments were being paid higher pay for doing the same work. He also sought regularisation on the a post. The learned Single Judge of the High Court, by judgment dated 24-5-1993, allowed the said writ petition and directed that Respondent 1 be regularised in the regular pay scale on the post of Photographer with effect from 1-7-1986. Writ Appeal No. 8 of 1993 filed by the appellants against the said judgment of the learned Single Judge has been dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court by the impugned judgment dated 30-9-1994. The learned Judges constituting the Division Bench of the High Court have held that the Cooperative Union was "State" under Article 12 of the Constitution 
 since it is under the control of the State Government of Tripura.
3. The learned Judges have further held that Respondent 1 possesses the qualifications required of a photographer and had, in fact, been working in all these years as a photographer and, therefore, there was no reason why an instrumentality of the State should deny him the benefits of the well-recognised principle of equal pay for equal work. The Division Bench of the High Court has also upheld the direction given by the learned Single Judge regarding regularisation of Respondent 1 on the post of Photographer. The learned Judges have distinguished the decisions of this Court in State of Haryana v. Piara Singh 1992 Indlaw SC 7771992 Indlaw SC 7771992 Indlaw SC 777 and Delhi Development Horticulture Employees' Union v. Delhi Admn.  1992 Indlaw SC 9571992 Indlaw SC 9571992 Indlaw SC 957 on the ground that the present case is of a lone employee.
4. We find it difficult to agree with the said view of the learned Judges of the High Court. On the question whether the Cooperative Union can be regarded as "State" under Article 12 of the Constitution 
 we find that the High Court has not dealt with the nature and extent of the control exercised by the State Government over the Cooperative Union. Though reference has been made by the High Court to the decisions of this Court in Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi  1980 Indlaw SC 2441980 Indlaw SC 2441980 Indlaw SC 244, International Airport Authorities case 1979 Indlaw SC 512 ,1979 Indlaw SC 16, Indian Council of Agricultural Research case 1985 Indlaw SC 2121985 Indlaw SC 2121985 Indlaw SC 212 and All India Sainik Schools Employees' Assn. case  1988 Indlaw SC 2171988 Indlaw SC 2171988 Indlaw SC 2171988 Indlaw SC 217, but the High Court has not considered the matter in the light of the tests laid down by this Court for determining whether a particular undertaking is an instrumentality of the State and can be regarded as "State" under Article 12 of the Constitution.
5. Similarly, with regard to the qualifications of Respondent 1, we find that the case of Respondent 1, as set out in the writ petition, was that he holds a diploma in Printing and Graphic Art (Commercial Photography) and has also passed two years' certificate course in Art and Craft. By letter dated 10-1-1995, the Cooperative Union sought a clarification from the Principal of Regional Institute of Printing Technology, State Council for Engineering and Technical Education, Government of West Bengal, regarding the qualifications possessed by Respondent 1. In response to the said letter the Principal of the Regional Institute of Printing Technology, by his letter dated 12-1-1994, informed the Administrator of the Cooperative Union that the diploma which has been granted to Respondent 1 was only with regard to photography and that it has no connection with the Technology of Printing.
6. The other statement made by Respondent 1 that he has passed two years certificate course in Art and Craft is also not correct because all that he has been able to show is that he was a student of the second year of the said course and there is nothing to show that he has passed the two years' course. The Principal, Government College of Art and Craft, Agartala, by his letter dated 12-1-1995, has informed the Executive Officer of the Cooperative Union that Respondent 1 discontinued his studies in the second year preparatory course in 1981-82 and that he neither passed the preparatory course nor passed five years' diploma course as per the office record of the Government College of Art and Craft, Agartala. It would thus appear that Respondent 1 has made incorrect statements about his qualifications.
7. As to the direction give by the High Court with regard to regularisation, it may be stated that there is no post of Photographer as such in the Cooperative Union and Respondent 1 was discharging the work of clerk. As a result of the direction given by the High Court for regularisation of Respondent 1, the Cooperative Union would be required to create a post of Photographer for the purpose of such regularisation. Such a direction was not permissible. Since there is no post of Photographer in the Cooperative Union the principle of equal pay for equal work can also not be applied.
8. For the reasons aforementioned, we are unable to uphold the judgment of the High Court. The appeal is, therefore, allowed, the impugned judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court dated 30-9-1994 as well as the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 24-5-1993 are set aside and the writ petition (Civil Rule No. 129 of 1992) filed by Respondent 1 is dismissed. It is clarified that in case the Cooperative Union makes a regular appointment on a post and if Respondent 1 fulfils the qualifications prescribed for the said post and applies for it he shall be considered for such appointment and the age requirement shall be relaxed for that purpose. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
