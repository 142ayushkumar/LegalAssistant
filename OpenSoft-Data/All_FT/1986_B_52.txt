S. C. Basavraja and Another v Boraiah
Supreme Court of India

17 December 1986
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 13853 of 1986 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 31 July 1986 of the High Court of Karnataka at Bangalore in C.R.P. No. 1045 of 1986).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The decision passed by the civil court has been held to be without jurisdiction by reason of the fact that neither the petitioners nor the respondent brought it in the notice of the civil court that the decision rendered by the Land Tribunal holding that the respondent was not a tenant had been set aside by the High Court in a writ petition.
The proper course for the petitioners therefore, would appear to be to approach the civil court and produce a copy of the order passed by the High Court remanding the matter of the Land Tribunal and request the court to set aside the decree passed unaware of the fact that the decision of the Land Tribunal had been set aside. The petitioners can apply to the civil court to exercise inherent powers in this behalf and to keep the suit pending till a final decision as regards the status of the respondent, who claims to be a tenant, is taken by the Land tribunal, subject to the order that may be passed by the High Court Tribunal, subject to the order that may be passed by the High Court in the writ petitions, if any, arising therefrom.
2.   We hope that the Land Tribunal which is seized of the matter in view of the order of the remand passed by the High Court will proceed to decide the matter expeditiously having regard to the fact that it is a very long drawn litigation.
3.  Subject to these observations, we see no reason to interfere with the order passed by the High Court.
The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
