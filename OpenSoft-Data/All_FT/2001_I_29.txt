Indian Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v G.S.Atwal and Company (Engineers) Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

29 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10926/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard the learned Solicitor General for the appellant and Mr. Gopal Subramaniam, Sr. Adv. for the respondent.
2.  The First Appeal FMAT No. 1646/2001 is pending disposal before the Calcutta High Court. During the pendency of the appeal the impugned order has been passed. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court completely erred in passing the impugned order.
3. We therefore set aside the impugned order of the Division Bench of Calcutta High Court dated 22.6.2001.
4.  The High Court is requested to dispose of the appeal at an early date. This order of ours is without prejudice to the contention of the parties as to the maintainability of the appeal before the High Court.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
