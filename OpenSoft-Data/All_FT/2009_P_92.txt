Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai v Pepsico India Holdings Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

14 January 2009
C.A. No. 3979 of 2004 With C.A. Nos. 1385 of 2006 and 1605 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In these Civil Appeals broadly two questions arise for determination, namely, whether the assessee was entitled to deduction in respect of trade discount; secondly, whether "machine usage charges" forms part of the assessable value of the product in question?
2.  On the first question the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that there is no flow back/return of the trade discount and consequently the assessee was entitled to claim deduction for the trade discount. We see no reason to interfere with the factual finding recorded by the Tribunal.
3.  As regards the second question, we find from the records that the vending machine stood installed by the holding company. Nonetheless, ownership of the vending machine vested in the marketing company. The machine charges were payable to the marketing company and not to the holding company.
4. In the circumstances, the said charges were not includable in the assessable value.
5.  Before concluding we may mention that the Civil Appeals filed by the Department are confined only to the afore-stated items, therefore, we are not required to examine the larger issue concerning valuation.
6.  The Civil Appeals are accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
