Lakshmi Narayan Mukhopadhyay v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

20 February 2002
Civil Appeal Nos. 4759-60 of 1996
The Judgment was delivered by : S. N. Phukan, J. and P. Venkatarama Reddi, J.
1. These appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Calcutta Bench dated 24.2.1995 and 29.6.1995 in O.A. No. 1170 of 1993 and Review Petition in M.A. No. 117 of 1995 respectively.
2. The appellant was employed in the ministry of railways as Inspector of works in-charge. He voluntarily retired from service on 30.11.1991. Since the post-retirement benefits were not paid to him in full, he approached the Tribunal. The Tribunal, on perusal of the record produced by the respondents, held that the appellant, Inspector of works supplied to contractors excess of material and a sum of Rs. 49,536 was recoverable from the appellant's gratuity amount. The impugned order dated 24.11.1992 was upheld.
3. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the Tribunal has erred in law inasmuch as this amount was arrived at by the respondent without giving opportunity to the appellant. On the other hand, learned counsel for the Union of India has contended that by letter dated 12.6.1991, the appellant was asked to explain and thereafter, the Divisional Railway Manager (Engg.), by letter dated 24.11.1992, i.e., after the voluntary retirement of the appellant, directed that the amount should be recovered from the amount of gratuity of the appellant. We extract below the relevant part of the letter which was produced before the High Court.
"It has been observed that Sr. L. N. Mukhopadhyay while functioning as IOW/SNY issued the following excess materials to contractors M/s. Hiramoti Construction (P.) Ltd., Jamshedpur without observing the guidelines issued by the Head Quarters Office and this office.
Competent authority issued orders for recovery of Rs. 19,535 from the DCRS and other dues of Sri L. N. Mukhopadhyay, Ex-IOW/SNY. You are, therefore, requested to make necessary recovery of Rs. 49,536 from the settlement dues of Shri L. N. Mukhopadhyay, Ex-IOW-SNY with an intimation to him and the recovery particulars may be intimated to this office to close the same.

4. There is nothing in the letter to show that this amount was arrived at after giving opportunity to the appellant or that the amount due was quantified by the date of retirement. The alleged letter dated 12.6.1991 giving show cause notice has not been brought on record or referred to in the impugned order. Moreover, what guidelines were not followed by the appellant, was also not indicated in the letter.
We, therefore, hold that in view of the aforesaid circumstances, the impugned order of the Tribunal dated 24.2.1995 in O. A. No. 1170 of 1993 is not sustainable and is accordingly set aside. We direct the respondents to pay the amount within two months. Learned counsel for the appellant prays for interest at the rate of 12%.
5. In the facts and circumstances of this case, we direct the respondents to pay a sum of Rs. 10,000 in lumpsum to the appellant in addition to the above said amount. The amount shall be released within a period of two months.
6. In view of the above order, there is no need to go into the correctness or otherwise of the order of the Tribunal dismissing the review application.
7. Appeals are accordingly disposed of.
