Ravindra Kumar Dutta and others v Union of India and another
Supreme Court of India

22 July 1986
W.Ps. Nos. 393, 394 and 442 of 1972 with W.Ps. Nos. 8212, 4478 and 7646 of 1982, 2359-60, 8260, and 1401 of 1981 and 17056 and 14107 of 1984
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Dr Chitale has squarely raised the question of vires of Rule 5 of Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964 the effect of which is to ban government employees from participation in any form of political activity. He contends that the ban offends Article 19(1)(a) and (c) and that it is not protected by clauses (2) and (4) of Article 19 as it cannot be said to have been imposed in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order or morality. Dr Chitale relies upon the decisions of this Court in Acharya Jagdishwaranand Avadhuta v. Commissioner of Police 1983 Indlaw SC 431 and State of M.P. v. Ranashanker Raghuvanshi, 1983 Indlaw SC 73 which to the extent that they go, appear to support his contention.
2. The question raised is of great importance and the acceptance of the contention may lead to complete revision of the accepted Civil Service Philosophy. We think it is desirable that these matters should be heard by a Constitution Bench. The Registry will seek appropriate directions from the Hon'ble Chief Justice.
Order accordingly.
