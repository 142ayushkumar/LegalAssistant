Raosaheb v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

8 October 2003
Cr.A. No.456 Of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard the learned senior counsel for the appellant and the learned counsel for the respondent.
2.  After hearing the learned counsel and having gone through the judgments of the courts below and the evidence on record to which our attention was invited, we feel that this is a case which on facts proved is covered by Exception IV to Section 300 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and, therefore, not under 302 Indian Penal Code, 1860
3. Taking into account the genesis of the occurrence, the manner and circumstances in which it was shown to have taken place which led to the death of the deceased, and the further fact that there was almost a free for all situation with mutual exchange of blows among large number of persons, , in the course of which, deceased lost his life on account of the blow given by the appellant, we alter the conviction into one under Section 304 Part II Indian Penal Code, 1860 The custodial sentence of eight years already undergone, would meet the ends of justice, so far as sentence is concerned.
The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.
4.  If the period of eight years indicated has already been suffered by the appellant, he shall be set at liberty forthwith, unless required in any other case.
Appeal partly allowed.
