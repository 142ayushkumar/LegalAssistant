The Order of the Court was as follows:
SLP(C) Nos.20617, 20726/2000 and 6004/2001
1.  Learned counsel for the workmen-respondents agrees that workmen would not claim any back-wages if they are re-instated in service on or before Ist October, 2001. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner-Board states that appropriate orders re-instating the respondents, as per the directions of the High Court, would be issued on or before Ist October, 2001. It is made clear that the respondents-workmen will not be entitled to any back-wages. With this modification in the impugned order passed by the High Court, the petitions stand disposed of.
SLP(C) No.6005-6009/2001
2.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner-Board submits that respondents-workmen in-connivance with the Officers have produced forged Award passed by the Labour Court. For this purpose he relies upon the certificate issued by the Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Varanasi on 13th December, 1999 wherein it has been inter-alia stated that Adjudication Case No.151/90 entitled Ravi Prakash S/o Sh. Rama Shankar and Adjudication Case No.209/90 Krishnamani S/o Sh. Rajender have not been registered in before the Labour Court. Therefore, it was not possible to give any certified copy of the Award.
3. In our view, this is a serious thing for which appropriate action is required to be taken if in reality respondents-workmen have committed any fraud. For this purpose it would be open to the petitioner to approach the High Court for review of the impugned judgment and order. Hence, this petition is disposed of accordingly.
4.  Petitioner to file review application before the High Court and High Court would decide the same in accordance with law, and in any case, would see that appropriate orders are issued for finding out whether, in reality, Adjudication Case Nos.151 and 209/90 were decided by the Labour Court in favour of the workmen. Meanwhile interim order passed by the High Court shall continue.
Petitions disposed of.
