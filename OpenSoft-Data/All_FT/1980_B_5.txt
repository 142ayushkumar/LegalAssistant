Municipal Corporation of Delhi v Baboo Ram Shyam Sunder and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 March 1980
Cr.As. Nos. 500 and 497 of 1978.
The Judgment was delivered by : Fazal Ali, J.
1. It is conceded by the learned counsel for the respondents that this case is clearly covered by our decision in the case of State of Kerala v. Alasserry Mohammed, 1978 Indlaw SC 3301978 Indlaw SC 3301978 Indlaw SC 330.
2.  The respondent however has argued that since the offence was committed in 1975 and in view of the sudden change of the law laid down by this Court, a logical view of the matter may be taken.
3.  As the order of acquittal passed by the magistrate was wrong in law, we set aside the same and convict respondent 1 (Firm known as M/s Baboo Ram Shyam Sunder) and respondent 2 (Baboo Ram) u/s. 7 read with S. 16 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954.
4. As regards the sentence, in view of the peculiar circumstances of this case and of the fact that the law was changed by this Court long after the acquittal of the respondent, we release respondent 2 on probation for a period of two years on execution of a bond of Rs 5000 with two sureties each in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi. We also impose a fine of Rs 3000 on respondent 1 and one of Rs 2000 on respondent 2. In default of payment of fine imposed on respondent 2, he shall suffer a rigorous imprisonment for six months. The fines shall be deposited within two months from today. Respondents 1 and 2 shall further give an undertaking to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate that they shall not indulge in any kind of adulteration in future.
Acquittal of respondent 3 (Shyam Sunder) is maintained.
Appeals disposed of.
