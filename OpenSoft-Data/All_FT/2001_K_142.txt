Punjab Agricultural University v Karam Singh and Anr
Supreme Court of India

12 December 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO.1950 OF 2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  The High Court disposed of the matter by an order under appeal stating that the first respondent be given the appointment as Head of the Department for the remaining period of four years of his tenure. That order was made on May 3, 1999. Inasmuch as that order has already been complied with, no useful purpose will be served by examining the various questions raised in this appeal.
2. However, the question of law is kept open for consideration in an appropriate case. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
