The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that in a connected matter this court has passed an order when special leave petition was filed in this Court, which is extracted below:
"Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the High Court was not told about the compromise which happened on 4.3.98. Hence a review petition can be filed before the High Court showing that fact. He, therefore, seeks leave of this Court to withdraw these SLPs without prejudice to his right to move the High Court in review. The SLPs are accordingly dismissed as withdrawn."
2. Learned counsel requests that this SLP may also be dismissed with the same observations.
SLP is dismissed as withdrawn with the above observations.
Petition dismissed.
