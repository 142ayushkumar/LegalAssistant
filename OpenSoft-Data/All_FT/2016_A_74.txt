1. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
2. Leave granted.
3. We remand the matter to the High Court for a simple reason that the High Court has not properly framed and answered the substantial questions of law which were supposed to be framed and answered by it before deciding the Second Appeal.
4. In these circumstances, we set aside the impugned order.
The High Court, after hearing the parties, shall dispose of the Second Appeal as soon as possible and preferably within six months from the date of intimation of this order.
5. The appeal stands disposed of as allowed.
There shall be no order as to costs.
Order accordingly
