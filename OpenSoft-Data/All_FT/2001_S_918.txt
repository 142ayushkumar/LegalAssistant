Sharad Jain v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

27 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2913-2914/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The plea is made that the benefit contemplated in the judgment in Bhagwan Rama Shinde Gosai and others vs. State of Gujarat may be extended to this appellant, as the sentence imposed on him by the trial court for imprisonment is only for seven years.
2.  Learned counsel for the respondent - State was not able to point out any reason to take a different view on the facts of this case. We are therefore inclined to suspend the sentence passed on the appellant. Hence the sentence will remain suspended during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court.
3. We, therefore, direct that the appellant be released on bail on executing a bond for such amount as the trial judge may fix with two solvent sureties to the satisfaction of the trial judge.These appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeals disposed of.
