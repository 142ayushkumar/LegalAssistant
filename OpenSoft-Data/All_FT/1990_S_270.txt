Parkash Chandra Agnihotri v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

24 July 1990
Cr.A. No. 160 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The courts below have maintained the conviction of the appellant under Section 304-A Indian Penal Code. We have gone through the judgments of courts below and we find no infirmity therein. We uphold the conviction. The occurrence took place on February 18, 1972. The appellant has throughout been on bail. He has been sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 250.
2. We are of the view that it would be rather harsh to send the appellant to jail after 18 years of the occurrence. The ends of justice would be met if the appellant is asked to pay a fine of Rs. 2000. The sentence is thus converted to a fine of Rs. 2000. On realisation the amount shall be paid to the family of the deceased girl. The amount be deposited with the trial court within two months from today and the trial court shall disburse the same to the parents of the girl and in the absence of the parents to the next of kin of the girl. In default of the payment of fine the appellant shall undergo imprisonment for six months.
3. Criminal appeal is disposed of in the above terms.
Appeal disposed of.
