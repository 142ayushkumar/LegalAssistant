U.O.I v Maha Singh (Dead) By LRs. and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6634/1999
The Order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1. The High Court enhanced the land value in this case to Rs.25, 000/- per bigha on the basis of an earlier judgment rendered by the High Court in RFA No.544 of 1992. Now Mr. K.N.Rawal, learned Additional Solicitor General invited our attention to a subsequent development in which this Court has set aside the High Court judgment in the aforesaid RFA 544/92 and fixed up the land value at Rs.16, 750/- per bigha.
2. Annexure P.3 is the copy of this court's judgment to show the said fact.
3.  Though we issued notice to the respondent no body had turned up to contest this appeal. In view of the aforesaid change and also in view of the fact that the High Court judgment is entirely based on the earlier decision which has subsequently been set aside by this Court we have to allow this appeal and fix the land value at the rate of Rs.16, 750/- per bigha. This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
