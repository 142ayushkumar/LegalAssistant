The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard the parties.
1.  By the impugned order the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as 'the National Commission') has refused to condone delay of 57 days in filing the appeal before it and dismissed the same as barred by limitation. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that the National Commission should have condoned the delay in filing the appeal.
2. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned order is set aside, delay in filing the appeal before National Commission is condoned and the matter is remitted to it for disposal of the appeal on merit in accordance with law after giving opportunity of hearing to the parties. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
