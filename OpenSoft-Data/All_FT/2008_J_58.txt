Isab & Ors. v Jan Mohammad & Ors
Supreme Court of India

5 February 2008
Appeal (civil) 2849 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In our view, this appeal is now concluded by the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the High Court as well as by the tribunals below on the question whether the appellants were liable to pay batai or chakota under the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953. After going through the judgment of the High Court as well as of the tribunals below, we do not find any infirmity in the said concurrent findings of fact recorded by the courts below.
2. Accordingly, we are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the High Court and the tribunals below.
3.  However, we direct that the appellants shall deliver peaceful vacant possession to the respondent by 31st of May, 2008 after filing usual undertaking within a fortnight from this date.
4.  The appeal is thus dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed
