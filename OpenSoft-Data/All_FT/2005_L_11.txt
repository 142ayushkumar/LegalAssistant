Jasvir Singh and others v Land Acquisition Officer, Rampur and another
Supreme Court of India

12 September 2005
C.As. Nos. 5914-15 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The learned counsel for the appellants submits that apart from the fact that he is aggrieved by the compensation as has been awarded by the High Court, the High Court has failed to award interest under Section 23(1-A) of the Land Acquisition Act.
2. It is further submitted that other statutory benefits like solatium have not been awarded to the appellants. Secondly, it is submitted that there is no basis for arriving at the figure of Rs. 30,000/- per acre.
3.  The learned counsel appearing for the respondents is unable to dispute any of these averments made on behalf of the appellants.
4.  Accordingly, the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside and the matter is remanded back to the High Court for decision afresh on merits and in accordance with law. Since the matter is quite old, the High Court will take steps to dispose of the matter expeditiously.
The appeals are disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
