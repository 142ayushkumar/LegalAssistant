State of Madhya Pradesh and Others v Shyama Charan Shukla
Supreme Court of India

6 September 1990
C.A. No. 185 of 1976. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 8 April 1974, of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Miscellaneous No. 178 of 1966. The judgment of the High Court is reported at [1974] 34 STC 504 (FB)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against the judgment of a Full Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dated April 8, 1974, quashing orders of the sales tax authorities on a petition by the respondent under article 226 of the Constitution of India, 1950.
2.   After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we find no good reason to interfere with the High Court's order as the High Court has quashed orders of sales tax authorities following the decisions of this Court in Ghanshyamdas v. Regional Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax and Anandji Haridas and Co. (P.) Ltd. v. S. P. Kushare. The appeal fails and accordingly dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
