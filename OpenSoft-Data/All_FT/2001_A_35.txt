30 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20474/2000
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We do not find any merit in this petition. The special leave petition is dismissed.
2.  Learned counsel for the petitioners states that in case the petitioners are required to vacate the premises in question immediately, they would be put to great hardship and for that reason the petitioners may be granted some time to vacate the premises. Learned counsel for the respondent has no objection.
3.  We, accordingly, direct that the petitioners shall not be dispossessed from the premises till 31st December, 2001 on filing a usual undertaking to this effect in this Court within four weeks from today.
Petition dismissed.
