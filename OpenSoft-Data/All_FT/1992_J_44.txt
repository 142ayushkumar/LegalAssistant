Jogi Jha v State of Bihar and Another
Supreme Court of India

4 December 1992
C.A. No. 1407 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This Civil Appeal is directed against the Judgment of the Patna High Court dated July 11, 1984. The appellant had filed a suit on April 6, 1967 challenging his order of dismissal from service dated June 27, 1960. The dismissal was challenged inter alia, on the ground that the Additional Superintendent of Police who had passed the order of dismissal was not his appointing authority and was lower in rank to the Superintendent of Police and as such the order of dismissal was violative of Article 311 of the 
 ConstitutionIssue No. 4 in the suit was framed in the following manner:
"The dismissal of the plaintiff from his service is illegal, void and without jurisdiction."
2.   Under this issue, the trial court held that the Additional Superintendent was an officer not of the same rank and grade as that of Superintendent of Police who was his appointing authority and as such the order of dismissal by the Additional Superintendent was wrong and illegal. The trial court however dismissed the suit on the ground that the suit was barred by limitation in view of the fact that cause of action for filing the suit arose on June 27, 1960 while the suit was filed on April 26, 1967. An appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed by the learned Second Additional District Judge and Second Appeal was also dismissed by the High Court in limine by order dated July 11, 1986.
3.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. In Civil Appeal No. 10275 of 1983 Raghubir Jha v. State of Bihar 1983 Indlaw SC 3111983 Indlaw SC 311, decided on November 7, 1983 this Court had taken the view that the period of limitation for filing the suit will be counted from the date of the final order passed by the State Government in Revision filed under the rules. It is not disputed in the present case that the residuary article shall govern the period of limitation. The suit filed on April 26, 1967 shall be within the period of limitation as the Revision in the present case filed under Rule 853-A of Bihar and Orissa Police Manual, 1938 was dismissed by the Government on October 28, 1965 and communicated on October 29, 1965 to the appellant.
4.   A Constitution Bench of this Court in S.S. Rathore v. State of M.P. 1988 Indlaw SC 3561988 Indlaw SC 3561988 Indlaw SC 356 has also taken a similar view. It was however contended on behalf of the respondents that Additional Superintendent of Police was included in the definition of Superintendent of Police under the Rules. We are not expressing any opinion on this point as we are remanding the appeal as the suit was dismissed on the ground of limitation.
5.  In view of these circumstances, we allow this appeal, set aside the Judgment and decree of the High Court and remand the case to the High Court with a direction to decide other questions according to law. In view of the fact that this is a very old matter, the High Court may decide the appeal within three months of the receipt of this order. The parties are directed to appear before the High Court on January 5, 1992. No order as to costs.
Appeal Allowed.
