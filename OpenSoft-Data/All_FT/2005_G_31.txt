Hari Shankar Singhania and others v Gaur Hari Singhania and others
Supreme Court of India

6 September 2005
C.A. No. 126 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the parties.
1.  Having regard to the nature of dispute and the fact that the contesting parties are close relatives, we are clearly of the view that it is still better that such dispute is resolved through conciliation, so that the past ill-feelings/misunderstandings, if any, are evaporated in the thin air with the resolution of the dispute. In response to our suggestion the parties agree to refer to a conciliator to be appointed by the Court.
2. Accordingly, we appoint Hon'ble Mr Justice N. Santosh Hegde, retired Judge of this Court to be the conciliator to resolve the dispute through conciliation. The terms and conditions and the place of sitting shall be decided by the conciliator himself. The fees and other expenses of the conciliator shall be borne equally by the three disputing parties.
3.  We hope and trust that the parties will resolve their dispute through conciliation with a view to maintain good relationship between the parties. This order is passed without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties that may arise in the proceedings. But it must be grasped that the approach of the parties must be accommodative and keep no records of wrong.
List it after three months.
Order accordingly.
