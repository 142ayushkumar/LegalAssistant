Sirajuddin Ansari v State Of Bihar & Ors
Supreme Court of India

5 December 2002
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Civil) No.11159/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave is granted.
1.  The only grievance of the appellant is that when he applied to the authorities pursuant to the notification issued with regard to the correction of date of birth, his application was rejected by a cyclostyled order dated 13th December, 2000. That order is filed as Annexure P-4 in this appeal. A perusal of the order shows that it is a proforma order which does not depict application of mind. That order was challenged but the High Court declined to interfere in the writ petition as well as in the writ appeal. So, theappellant is before this Court.
2. Having regard to the nature of the order impugned in the writ petition, we are afraid, we cannot sustain the order which is devoid of application of mind.
3.  We, therefore, quash the order dated 13th December, 2000 and direct the authorities to consider the application afresh and pass a reasoned order in accordance with law. The order under challenge is set aside and the civil appeal is, accordingly, allowed. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
