The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The dispute is between the revenue and M/s.Jeesop and Co. Ltd. and Richardson and Creddes (1972) Ltd. and the nature of the question for decision is such that it would arise only in respect of the liability of the Public Sector Companies for the payment of the duty. The course to be followed when the parties to the litigation of this kind has been indicated by this Court in Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. Collector of Central Excise, 1991 Indlaw SC 17 which has later been clarified with an order of the same time in Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. Collector of Central Excise, 1994 Indlaw SC 74.
2.

This has not been done in the present cases. The course indicated in those orders passed by this Court has to be adopted by the revenue.
3.  These appeals have, therefore, to be disposed of in terms of those orders. It is directed accordingly.
