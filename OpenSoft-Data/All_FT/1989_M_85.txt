Supreme Court of India

21 April 1989
S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 2707 of 1988 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 5 July 1988 of the Bombay High Court in Cri. P. No. 745 of 1988)
The Judgment was delivered by: RAY, J.
1.  On January 27, 1989 this Court heard the petitioner-in-person and considering her willingness to compromise all cases pending against respondent 1 if reasonable compensation is paid to her, notice was directed to be issued to respondents 1 and 2 for final disposal of the case at the notice stage itself. Pursuant to that notice respondents 1 and 2 appeared before this Court through their counsel and stated that respondent 1 is willing to pay a sum of Rs. 15, 000 as compensation to the petitioner if the petitioner withdraws all the criminal cases brought by her against respondents 1 and 2.
2.   The petitioner who appeared in person before this Court is not inclined to withdraw her cases on accepting the said sum but wanted a much higher sum
3.  The special leave petition is against the judgment and order made by the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dismissing the application for contempt and discharging the rule. We do not find any merit in the application for special leave and as such we dismiss the same. There will be no order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.
