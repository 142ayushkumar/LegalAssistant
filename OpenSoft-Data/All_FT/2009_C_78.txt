Chandra and others v State of Uttarkhand
Supreme Court of India

15  May  2009
Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No(s). 6484/2008
1. This matter has been mentioned on behalf of the petitioners in respect of the order passed by us on 4th May, 2009, rejecting the prayer for bail made on behalf of the petitioner No.4. While doing so, it appears that the Special Leave Petition was also dismissed and the hearing of the appeal before the High Court, was expedited.
2. However, since there is no pending appeal before the High Court, recording that the hearing of the appeal before the High Court be expedited, is obviously incorrect. Accordingly, let the order be corrected to read that leave is granted as far as the Special Leave Petition is concerned and the hearing of the appeal be expedited. Let the corrections be made by the Registry.
Order accordingly
