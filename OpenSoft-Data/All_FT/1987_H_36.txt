R. P. Kapur v Hon'ble Chief Justice, Delhi High Court, New Delhi
Supreme Court of India

17 February 1987
W.P. No. 120 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We do not think that we can issue any writ under Article 32 of the Constitution as prayed for. The complaint of the petitioner is that three of the cases to which he is a party, had been pending in the High Court for several years and that though they are listed for hearing they are not being heard. He also states that there are several cases like the cases to which he is a party which though pending for years have not been taken up for hearing by the High Court. It is within our province to arrange the calendar of the High Court. It is entirely a matter for the High Court.
2. The petitioner suggests the need for drastic reform in the procedural laws at least by amending the Rules of the High Court. While we agree that there is need for immediate reform we cannot issue a writ to direct the High Court to make rules to incorporate the suggested reforms.
3. We therefore dismiss the writ petition with a request to the High Court to consider the question whether the old cases referred to by the petitioner may not be heard at an early date perhaps subject to the part-heard case as was ordered by the High Court on January 20, 1986.
Petition dismissed.
