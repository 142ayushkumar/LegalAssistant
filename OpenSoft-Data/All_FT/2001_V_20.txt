Secretary To Government Of Tamilnadu and Others v V. Surenthiran
Supreme Court of India

26 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12365/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Normally we would not have entertained a petition of this nature since the same relates to an interim order.
2.  The facts in issue stand peculiar to itself and complications are bound to arise by reason of the grant of interim order. The High Court by its interim order not only directed publication of the result of the concerned student but mandated issuance of necessary certificate therefor. We do feel it expedient to record that such an interim order cannot be sustained under any circumstances.
3.  The impugned interim order thus stand set aside and quashed. The High Court shall deal with the pending appeal in question with utmost expedition and preferably within a period of six months from the date of the communication of this Order. The parties would be at liberty to mention the matter before the High Court in regard to expeditious disposal of the matter.
4. Let it be recorded that we are not expressing any opinion on the merits of the case. The civil appeal is allowed. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
