2. We, therefore, direct the learned District Sessions Judge, Sriganganagar, to make an enquiry into the matter and submit a report within one month from the date of the receipt of this order, after adducing opportunity to the parties to lead evidence on the question whether the petitioner, Mukhtiar Singh, is in fact the person whose detention is intended. It will be open to the District Sessions Judge to direct release of the detenu Mukhtiar Singh on parole if he considers it necessary for the purpose of inquiry.
Order accordingly.
