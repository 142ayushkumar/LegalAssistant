Union of India v Smt. Mamta Sethi
Supreme Court of India

11 August 2000
Cr.A. No. 661 of 2000
The Judgment was delivered by: THOMAS, J.
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  Respondents were convicted under ss. 276C and 277 of the Indian IT Act, but they were released under the Probation of Offenders Act. Appellant union challenged the said order before the High Court in a criminal appeal. But a learned single Judge of the High Court dismissed the appeal with one sentence.
"I find no reason to interfere with the order of the trial Court, hence, dismissed."
2.  The contention of the appellant union is that the trial Court as well as the High Court missed to notice s. 292A of the Indian IT Act containing an express bar against the invocation of the provisions of the Probation of OffendersAct in respect of the offence enumerated in the IT Act.
3. Prima facie, the said interdict is insurmountable but learned counsel for the respondents contended that they are able to convince the High Court that they are not liable to conviction at all under s. 276C or 277 of the Indian IT Act. It is open to the respondents to canvass for the said position in the appeal which union filed against them. Without prejudice to their right in raising such contention we set aside the impugned order and send the criminal appeal back to the High Court for disposal afresh according to law.
This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
