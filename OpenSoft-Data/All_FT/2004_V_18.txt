Vasantrao S. Shinde v Rajguru G. Shinde and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 October 2004
C.A. No. 5926 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  During the course of hearing, the learned counsel for the parties submitted that a civil suit has been filed by the respondents for possession against the appellant, which is pending.
2. In the said suit, issue of tenancy has also been raised and it has been referred to a tenancy court under Section 85-A of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948.
3.  This being the position, it is unnecessary to examine the respective contentions of the parties in this appeal. It is enough to state that the parties shall be governed by the decree that may be passed in the said suit. The said suit shall be decided by the court independently on its own merits uninfluenced by any of the observations made in these proceedings. It is needless to state that till the said suit is disposed of, the possession of the appellant shall not be disturbed.
The civil appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
