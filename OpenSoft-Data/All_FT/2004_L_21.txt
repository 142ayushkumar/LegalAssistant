Laxminarayana and others v North East Securities Limited and others
Supreme Court of India

14 September 2004
Cr.A. No. 390 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  By the impugned judgment a prayer made in terms of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short "CrPC") was rejected. On going through the orders of the High Court we find no infirmity in the conclusions arrived at. It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellants that in a connected matter the Court while considering whether charge is to be framed, discharged accused persons, the appellants and that too in a case which involved same parties. Mere dismissal of the application under Section 482 CrPC does not take away the right of an accused to place materials at the time when the question of framing charge is taken up to show that the materials do not justify framing of charge.
2. It shall be open to the appellants to place such materials as are legally permissible to be placed before the court when the question of framing charge is taken up by the court concerned. We express no opinion upon that aspect. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
