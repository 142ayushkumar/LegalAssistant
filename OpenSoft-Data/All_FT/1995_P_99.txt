Prof. Shradha Kumari v Hon. High Court of Allahabad and Others
Supreme Court of India

24 January 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this appeal conviction recorded under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 is the subject-matter  challenge.
The High Court has found the appellant guilty for not obeying its interim order whereby a student suffered and could not gain the advantage he had acquired under the interim orders of the High Court pending a writ petition. The appellant tried to justify her conduct and, in the alternative, tendered an unqualified apology. The High Court did not advert to this aspect of the matter but rather went on to reject her justification whereafter if imposed on her a fine of Rs. 500 and also issued a reprimand to her.
2.   We are told that the appellant has since retired. The ends of justice in the changed scenario would now be met if we remit the fine. She stands reprimanded by the impugned order and we cannot unreprimand her by mere words. The matter can, thus, rest on the remission of fine. It is so done. And this disposes of the appeal.
Appeal disposed of.
