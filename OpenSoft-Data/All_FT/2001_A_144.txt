Amarjeet Singh Amjeet Singh v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

19 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3272/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We have heard Shri Gaurav Agarwal learned counsel for the petitioner and Shri R.N. Trivedi learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondent.
Leave granted.
2.  In the last paragraph of the order dated 9.10.2001 in Cr.Misc.No.21200/2001 the High Court while rejecting the prayer for bail observed that if the trial is not concluded till 12.4.2002 the petitioner may renew his prayer for bail after the said date. Similar orders postponing the consideration of the petition for bail on merits were passed on the bail petitions filed by the petitioner earlier. We are of the view that the High Court should have considered the petition for bail and passed appropriate orders on merits. The manner in which the successive petitions filed by the petitioner have been dealt with, does not commend us.
3.  Though charges have been framed, the trial is yet to begin. The petitioner has been in jail for more than a year. In the circumstances, the order passed by the High Court is set aside and it is ordered that the petitioner shall be released on bail on executing a bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court, subject to further conditions that he will be present in Court during trial unless exempted and that he will not do anything to tamper with evidence or influence any witness for the prosecution and he shall not leave the jurisdiction of the trial court without the leave of Court. The criminal appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
