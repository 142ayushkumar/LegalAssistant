Supreme Court of India

10 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20465-20466/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having regard to the impugned order of the Division Bench dated November 23, 2000, which inter alia mentions as follows:
"We have already granted liberty to the appellant by our order dated 20th November, 2000, to bring a fresh suit. All these issues can be urged by him and the trial court will give its finding thereby."
2. In our view no interference in the impugned order is warranted. The Special Leave Petition is, therefore, dismissed. We make it clear that this order does not preclude the petitioner from availing liberty given the petitioner in the said order.
Contempt Petition (C) Nos. 120-121/2001.
The Contempt petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
