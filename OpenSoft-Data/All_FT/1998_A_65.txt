Ananta Prasad Jena v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

27 August 1998
C.A. No. 2439 of 1993
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The appointment of the appellant as Extra-Departmental Sub-Postmaster has been set aside by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Cuttack on the ground that the appellant was also working as an agent for Life Insurance Corporation, Peerless and for selling National Saving Certificates. The Tribunal has proceeded on a wrong assumption that an Extra-Departmental Sub-Postmaster cannot have any other avocation in life. This assumption is wrong.
2. In fact, in the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the Department of Posts, it has been stated that there is no bar against an Extra-Departmental Sub-Postmaster from earning income elsewhere, in the present case, as an agent of Life Insurance Corporation. In view thereof, the impugned order of the Tribunal is set aside and the application filed before the Tribunal is dismissed.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
