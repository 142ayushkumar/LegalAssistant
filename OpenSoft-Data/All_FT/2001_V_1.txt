V. Antony v State Bank of India and Anr
Supreme Court of India

9  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7558-7559/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner was dismissed on 7th April, 1984 by the Bank of Cochin after an enquiry had been held. In 1985, the Bank of Cochin amalgamated with the State Bank of India. The petitioner has now challenged his dismissal and wants reinstatement.
2. At the time when the petitioner was removed from service, he was admittedly an employee of a private bank. This being so, the relief of reinstatement could not be granted if the petitioner had chosen to file a civil suit and consequently even if a writ petition could have been filed such a relief could not have been granted.
3.  We may here notice that the authorities have come to the conclusion that the petitioner was not a workman within the meaning of that expression under the Industrial Disputes Act.
The special leave petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
