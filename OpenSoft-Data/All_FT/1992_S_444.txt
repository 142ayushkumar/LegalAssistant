T. N. Document Writers' Association Represented By Its Secretary v State of Tamil Nadu and Another
Supreme Court of India

24 September 1992
C.A. No. 3187 of 1991.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In our opinion the High Court's judgment calls for no interference in so far as it has given relief to the appellant and directed that document writers should get higher grade typewriting qualification only in one language either English or Tamil but not both.
Otherwise the requirement that the document writers should have a higher grade qualification in typewriting does not appear to be an unreasonable restriction and we agree with the High Court in this respect.
2.  It appears to us, however, that having regard to the sudden change in qualification prescribed by the Government, it is necessary and it will also be equitable on the part of the Government to give to the members of the Association, having their licences in earlier years, an adequate opportunity to qualify themselves as required by the amended rules.
3. We, therefore, consider it reasonable to hold that the new rules should not be implemented in respect of persons who had been having licences prior to August 4, 1989, unless they fail to qualify in the higher writing examination within such reasonable period not less than three years from today as the Government may prescribe. We hope the Government will implement this by issuing orders to this effect immediate.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
