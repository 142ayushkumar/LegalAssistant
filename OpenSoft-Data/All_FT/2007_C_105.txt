Leave granted in special leave petitions.
1.  In this batch of civil appeals we are required to consider the scope of S. 78(5) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994 which is in pari materia to Section 22A (7) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954.
2.  For the sake of convenience we may mention the facts in Civil Appeal No.5197 of 2005 M/s. Guljag Industries v. Commercial Taxes Officer 2007 Indlaw SC 888.
3.  On 21.1.95 near the Banar Road Check Post a vehicle was checked in which 47 barrel of chemicals were transported from Vishakapattanam. Along with the goods, outward gate pass No.4331 dated 16.9.95 of Andhra Petro-Chemicals Ltd. and consignment No.920 dated 16.9.95 of M/s. AVR & Co. were found in which the name of the consignor was shown as M/s. Andhra Petro-Chemicals Ltd. Vishakapattanam and the name of the assessee was mentioned as M/s. Guljag Industries (assessee - appellant herein). Along with the goods, Form ST 18A No.236084 was also found in which the goods transported was not declared though the same was duly signed. Under the above circumstances the A.O. came to the conclusion that there was a contravention of the provisions of Section 22A(3) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954 (for short, 'RST Act 1954') read with Rule 62A(3) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Rules, 1955 (for short, 'RST Rules 1955'). He accordingly issued notice under Section 22A(7) of the RST Act 1954 calling upon M/s. Guljag Industries to show cause why penalty was not leviable for violation of Section 22A(3) of the RST Act 1954.
In response to the said notice M/s. Guljag Industries submitted that there was mistake in filing the declaration form and, therefore, there was no intention of tax evasion. It was further submitted that the said declaration Form ST 18A (Form No.18A) was supposed to be filled in by the consignor but due to lack of knowledge of Hindi language the same could not be filled in by the consignor. The AO did not accept the Explanation given by M/s. Guljag Industries. The AO refused to accept the unfilled form as a declaration. Accordingly, he imposed the penalty under Section 22A(7) of the RST Act 1954. Aggrieved by the decision of the AO, M/s. Guljag Industries preferred Appeal No.77/RST/JUC/95-96. By order dated 10.8.99, Dy. Commissioner (Appeals) came to the conclusion that under Rule 25(3) of RST Rules 1955 the purchasing dealer was required to give the requisite declaration in Form ST 18A to the selling dealer.
4.  According to the appellate authority, the responsibility to fill the form was on M/s. Guljag Industries. That, M/s. Guljag Industries carried on business from Rajasthan. It was familiar with Hindi language. Therefore, the unfilled Form No.18A cannot be accepted as a declaration. The appeal was accordingly dismissed. Aggrieved by the decision of Dy. Commissioner (Appeals), M/s. Guljag Industries carried the matter in second appeal to Rajasthan Tax Board, Ajmer being Appeal No.1375/99/Jodhpur. By that time Rajasthan Sales Tax Act 1994 (for short, 'RST Act 1994') came to replace RST Act 1954. However, S. 78(5) of RST Act 1994 was in pari materia to Section 22A(7) of RST Act 1954. By order dated 27 February 2002 the Board came to the conclusion that penalty could not be imposed without establishing guilty mind (mens rea) on the part of M/s. Guljag Industries (assessee). The appeal was allowed.
5.  Aggrieved by the decision of the Board, the Department carried the matter in revision to the Rajasthan High Court. By order dated 14.10.03 the single Judge held that presence of mens rea was not a sine qua non for levying penalty in case of contravention of Section 22A(3) of the RST Act 1954 (S. 78(2) of the RST Act 1994). By the said order the learned single Judge held that in the present case Form No.18A was totally blank though signed by the consignee; that it was the duty of the consignee or his agent to see that the form was returned to the transporter with complete details by the consignor. It was further held that the filling up of the form was the duty of the consignee/importer. The learned single Judge held that in the circumstances since the consignee was from Rajasthan and since the form was unfilled it cannot be said that the error was accidental.
6. That, moreover in both the States, namely, Andhra Pradesh (Vishakapattanam) and Rajasthan, there are Hindi-speaking persons. In the circumstances, the learned single Judge held that the form was deliberately not filled in which indicated an intention of the assessee M/s. Guljag Industries to evade the tax. Accordingly, the order of the Board was set aside. Aggrieved by the order passed in revision by the single Judge the assessee (M/s. Guljag Industries) has come to this Court by way of Civil Appeal No.5197 of 2005.
7.  In Civil Appeal No.5240 of 2005 Assistant Commercial Taxes Officer v. M/s. Guljag Industries Ltd. preferred by the Department the facts are as follows.
8. On 1 Novemeber 90 at Abu Road Check-Post, a vehicle was checked which was carrying goods. On search the driver furnished GR No.1 dated 31 October 90 issued by M/s. Delhi Bombay Road Lines. The consignment was shown to be M/s. Sumit Marbles, Abu Road. There was Bill No.122 dated 31 October 90. That Bill referred to 50.31 sq. meters of granite priced at Rs.34,494 and the name of the recipient was shown M/s. Sri Parashwanath Granites. On verification of the vehicle, the goods were found to be more than the quantity shown in the bill. On searching the vehicle two envelopes were found one of which was of M/s. Sri Parashwanath Granites and other was of M/s. Hindustan Granites. Being suspicious of the evasion of tax, notice under Rule 54 of RST Rules 1995 was issued on 16 November 90.
9.  The representative of the assessee appeared. He deposited the disputed penalty amount and goods were released. In reply to the show cause notice given to the assessee proposing levy of penalty under Section 22A(7) of the RST Act 1954, it was submitted by the assessee that he had delivered the relevant documents to the transporter which were found to be in the vehicle at the time of the seizure of the goods and, therefore, the assessee was not liable to be penalized under the said Section. According to the assessee (M/s. Sri Parashwanath Granites), the driver of the vehicle had made a mistake in not producing the documents which were with him at the time of checking and, therefore, the assessee was not liable to be penalized for breach of Rule 62A RST Rules 1955. This explanation was not accepted.
10.  On appeal, the Dy. Commissioner (Appeals) confirmed the levy of penalty. The appellate authority held that non-production of the Bill at the check-post indicated guilty mind of the assessee to evade tax. On further appeal, the Rajasthan Sales Tax Tribunal vide order dated 31.3.93 took the view that mere non-production of document by the driver at the check-post cannot result in levy of penalty. Against the order of the Tribunal, a revision was filed before the single Judge of the High Court, however, on constitution of Rajasthan Taxation Tribunal, it stood transferred. The Tribunal took the view that it was obligatory on the part of the consignee or his agent to carry with him the requisite documents and also to produce the documents at the check-post on demand by the officer. The Tribunal took the view that contravention of Section 22A of the RST Act 1954 cannot be obliterated by producing subsequently the documents at the time of assessment. The Tribunal took the view that Rules 62A and 63 of the RST Rules 1955 have no application. The said rules applied at the stage of assessment.
11. Accordingly, the Tribunal held that penalty was automatic once the driver on demand failed to produce the document lying with him or if he fails to produce the documents accompanied the goods under Section 22A(3) of the RST Act 1954. According to the Tribunal, once the offence is complete subsequent furnishing of the documents even if bona fide will not relieve the owner of the goods from liability of penalty. This decision of the Tribunal was challenged by M/s. Sri Parashwanath Granites. By judgment dated 2 June 2004, the High Court held that the levy of penalty was not automatic in the case where the goods in movement are found to be unaccompanied by the required documents. According to the High Court, the question of levy of penalty would arise only before the goods are delivered to consignee and if it is found that the goods are in movement unaccompanied with documents.
12.  On facts the High Court found that if for some reason the driver failed to produce these documents at the check-post which were subsequently produced and which were not false or forged, it could not be said that there was intention to evade the tax. The High Court held that merely because the driver had not shown the documents given to him by the assessee, could not make the assessee guilty of contravention. Consequently, the High Court held that notwithstanding the failure on the part of the driver to show the bill accompanying the goods at the time of checking but in fact recovered from its possession later on ruled out the possibility of the document being subsequently prepared, accordingly, the order imposing penalty was set aside. At this stage, we may state that even in this ruling of the High Court in the case of Sri Parashwanath Granites, the High Court has clarified that the case of Sri Parashwanath Granites was not the case of the documents being incorrect. On the contrary, the High Court found that the document, namely, the bill accompanying the goods was correct in all respects and, therefore, there was no tax evasion. Consequently, the order imposing penalty was set aside. This decision of the High Court in Sri Parashwanath Granites has been followed by the High Court in the case of M/s. Guljag Industries. Hence, aggrieved by the said decision, the Department has come to this Court by way of Civil Appeal No.5240 of 2005.
13.  Existence of mens rea is an essential ingredient of an offence. However, it is a rule of construction. If there is a conflict between the common law and the statute law, one has to construe a statute in conformity with the common law. However, if it is plain from the statue that it intends to alter the course of the common law, then that plain meaning should be accepted. Existence of mens rea is an essential ingredient in every offence; but that presumption is liable to be displaced either by the words of the statute creating the offence or by the subject matter with which it deals. A penalty imposed for a tax delinquency is a civil obligation, remedial and coercive in its nature, and is different from the penalty for a crime.
14.  Therefore, the short point which arises for determination in this batch of civil appeals is : whether the above presumption, namely, that mens rea is an essential ingredient in every offence is displaced by the words of S. 78(5) RST Act 1994.
15.  To decide the above question we quote hereinbelow Section 22A of the RST Act 1954 which reads as under:
"22A Establishment of check-post or barrier and inspection of goods while in transit.
(1) If the State Government or the Commissioner considers it necessary that with a view to prevent or check evasion of tax under this Act in any place or places within the State it is necessary so to do, it may; by notification in the Official Gazette, direct the setting up of a check-post or the erection of a barrier or both at such place or places as may be specified in the notification;

35. Since the RST Act 1954 has been substituted verbatim by the RST Act 1994 we prefer to analyse the RST Act 1994.
36.  The said RST Act 1994 came into force on 1st October 1995. S. 3 of the RST Act 1994 states that if the turnover of a dealer exceeds Rs.50,000/- in case he is an importer and if his turnover exceeds Rs.1,00,000/- in other case, he shall be liable to get registration under the Act. Under Section 4, the tax payable by a dealer shall be at a single point in the series of sales by successive dealers. Under Section 6, it is stated that in case of a dealer other than a manufacture or processor whose total accessible purchases in a year does not exceed Rs.10 lakhs may be allowed by the AO to pay tax on aggregate basis. S. 7 refers to payment of self-assessed tax. S. 12 refers to levy of tax on the turnover at each point of sale by the dealer. Section 13A deals with levy of turnover tax. Chapter VIII deals with inspection, search, seizure and anti-evasion provisions. Under S. 78(1) the Commissioner has the power to set up check-posts at such place and for such period as may be specified. S. 78(2) requires the driver or person incharge of a vehicle or incharge of the goods to carry with him goods-vehicle record (including challans and bills, despatch memos, bills of sale and prescribed declaration forms. Under Explanation (iii) it is stipulated that for the purposes of Chapter VIII the goods in movement shall mean the goods which are in possession of the transporter. Under S. 78(5) the competent officer has to give hearing to the owner or his representative and after enquiry the competent officer is empowered to impose on the owner a penalty equal to 30 per cent of the value for movement of goods in contravention of S. 78(2).
37.  The facts enumerated above in Civil Appeal No.5197 of 2005 is the lead case in which one finds that the goods in movement were carried with blank declaration forms though signed by the consignee. The material particulars like quality, weight and description of the goods required to be filled in by the assessee (consignee) were left blank. Therefore, in this batch of civil appeals we are concerned with cases where the goods in movement were carried with blank Form ST 18A. In our view, on the face of it there was contravention of S. 78(2) of the RST Act 1994. Under Rule 53 of the RST Rules 1995 (Rule 25C of the RST Rules 1955) every registered dealer who imports taxable goods, for sale within the State, is required to furnish declaration Form 18A completely filled in, in all respects (emphasis supplied by us). Under Rule 53 of the said Rules the counterfoils of the declaration has to be retained by such consignee and its portions marked as 'original' and 'duplicate' have to be carried with the goods in movement. Under Rule 53(1)(c) the driver of the goods in movement has to carry with him documents specified in S. 78(2)(a) as also the declaration form prescribed in S. 78(2)(a).
38. Under the said Rule 53(1)(c) the driver is required to produce the declaration form, suo motu at the check-post at the time of inspection when the competent officer is required to retain the original of the declaration form and return the duplicate portion to the driver. The competent officer shall thereafter forward the original portion of the declaration to the A.O. of the registered dealer or to the authority which has issued the declaration form to the consignee. Under Rule 53(2) the registered dealer is required to submit a statement of import of goods in the Form 18A to the A.O. every quarter. Under Rule 53(4) where a registered dealer fails to furnish such statement the A.O. or the authority who issued the declaration forms may impose penalty under S. 68 of the said Act. Similarly, under Rule 54 of the RST Rules 1994, a dealer who despatches any taxable goods to a place outside the State is also required to carry declaration in Form 18C with the goods in movement for export out of Rajasthan or in the course of interstate trade or commerce. The dealer is also required to submit his statement of exports to the A.O. along with his returns which he files quarterly. Form 18A, as quoted above, is in two parts. Part-A has to be filled in by the consignee. Part-B has to be filled in by the consignor. The nature of the transaction as to whether it is by consignment or by depot transfer or by interstate sale has to be indicated by the consignee.
39.  Similarly, the consignee has to indicate the description of the goods. In the present case the consignee (assessee) has left the requisite columns blank. Part-B has to be filled in by the consignor. Part-B requires the consignor to give the estimated value of goods. He has also to give invoice number and the date. It is important to note that the declaration form is collected by the consignee from his A.O. in the State of Rajasthan. The consignee gives an undertaking to get Part-B filled by the consignor. Similarly, the consignee gives a declaration that facts stated in Part-A are true to his knowledge. In the present case, the entire form was left blank though it had been signed by the consignee. Therefore, the declaration given by the consignee is meaningless. There are no facts given in Part-A. There is no identity of the goods transported. There is no description of the goods in movement. As stated above, the original has to be placed before the A.O. by the officer at the check-post. If the form which ultimately goes to the A.O. is blank in all material respects then it is impossible for the A.O. to assess the dealer and it is this practice which has resulted in loss of revenue in crores to the State.
40. Without description of the goods imported, it is easy to manipulate the value. If material particulars are not submitted, one fails to understand how assessment could be finalized. Moreover, as submitted on behalf of the State it has become a common practice to circulate the same form again and again resulting in loss of revenue to the State. It is for this reason that Rule 53 of the RST Rules 1995 contemplates the form to be submitted duly filled in and duly completed. In the present case, the goods in movement were not supported by duly filled in Form No.18A/18C. Therefore, there was contravention of S. 78(2) of the RST Act 1994.
41.  There is dichotomy between contravention of S. 78(2) of the said Act which invites strict civil liability on the assessee and the evasion of tax. When a statement of import/export is not filed before the A.O. it results in evasion of tax, however, when the goods in movement are carried without the declaration Form No.18A/18C then strict liability comes in, in the form of S. 78(5) of the said Act. Breach of S. 78(2) imposes strict liability under S. 78(5) because as stated above goods in movement cannot be carried without Form No.18A/18C. We are not concerned with non-filing of statements before the A.O. We are concerned with the goods in movement being carried without supporting declaration forms. The object behind enactment of S. 78(5) which gives no discretion to the competent authority in the matter of quantum of penalty fixed at 30 per cent of the estimated value is to provide to the State a remedy for the loss of revenue. The object behind enactment of S. 78(5) is to emphasise loss of revenue and to provide a remedy for such loss. It is not the object of the said Section to punish the offender for having committed an economic offence and to deter him from committing such offences.
42. The penalty imposed under the said S. 78(5) is a civil liability. Willful consignment is not an essential ingredient for attracting the civil liability as in the case of prosecution. S. 78(2) is a mandatory provision. If the declaration Form 18A/18C does not support the goods in movement because it is left blank then in that event S. 78(5) provides for imposition of monetary penalty for non-compliance. Default or failure to comply with S. 78(2) is the failure/default of statutory civil obligation and proceedings under S. 78(5) is neither criminal nor quasi-criminal in nature. The penalty is for statutory offence. Therefore, there is no question of proving of intention or of mens rea as the same is excluded from the category of essential element for imposing penalty. Penalty under S. 78(5) is attracted as soon as there is contravention of statutory obligations. Intention of parties committing such violation is wholly irrelevant. Moreover, in the present case, we find that goods in movement carried with Form No.18A/18C. The modus operandi adopted by the assessees itself indicates mens rea. This is not the case where goods in movement are carried without the declaration forms. In the present matter, as stated above, goods in movement were carried with the declaration forms. These forms were duly signed, however, material particulars were not filled in. The explanation given by the assessees in most of the cases is that they are not responsible for the misdeeds of the consignors. The other explanation given by the assessees is regarding the language problem. There is no merit in these defences. They are excuses. The declaration forms were unfilled so that they could be used again and again. The forms were collected by the consignee from the said Department.
43.  The consignee undertakes to see that the value of the goods is supplied by the consignor. It is not open to the consignee to keep the column in respect of the description of goods as blank. Even the column dealing with nature of transaction is left blank. The consignee is the buyer of the goods. He knows the descriptions of the goods which he is supposed to buy. There is no reason for leaving that column blank. Therefore, there are no special circumstances in any case for waiver of penalty for contravention of S. 78(2). The assessees were fully aware that the goods in movement had to be supported by Form ST 18A/18C. Therefore, they made the goods travelled with the forms. However, the said forms are left blank in all material respects. Therefore, A.O. was right in drawing inference of mens rea against the assessees. It has been repeatedly argued before us that apart from the declaration forms the assessees possessed documentary evidence like invoice, books of accounts etc. to support the movement of goods and, therefore, it was open to the assessees to show to the competent authority that there was no intention to evade the tax. We find no merit in this argument. Firstly, we are concerned with contravention of S. 78(2) which requires the goods in movement to travel with the declaration in Form 18A/18C duly filled in. It is S. 78(2)(a) which has been contravened in the present case by the assessees by carrying the goods with blank forms though signed by the consignee. In fact, the assessees resorted to the above modus operandi to hoodwink the competent officer at the check-post. As stated above, if the form is left incomplete and if the description of the goods is not given then it is impossible for the assessing officer to assess the taxable goods.
44.  Moreover, in the absence of value/price it is not possible for the A.O. to arrive at the taxable turnover as defined u/s. 2(42) of the said Act. Therefore, we have emphasized the words "material particulars" in the present case. It is not open to the assessees to contend that in certain cases of interstate transactions they were not liable in any event for being taxed under the RST Act 1994 and, therefore, penalty for contravention of S. 78(2) cannot be imposed. As stated hereinabove, declaration has to be given in Form 18A/18C even in respect of goods in movement under interstate sales. It is for contravention of S. 78(2) that penalty is attracted under S. 78(5). Whether the goods are put in movement under local sales, imports, exports or interstate transactions, they are goods in movement, therefore, they have to be supported by the requisite declaration. It is not open to the assessee to contravene and say that the goods were exempt. Without disclosing the nature of transaction it cannot be said that the transaction was exempt. In the present case, we are only concerned with the goods in movement not being supported by the requisite declaration.
45.  In the case of Chairman, SEBI v. Shriram Mutual Fund and Another (2006) 5 SCC 361 2006 Indlaw SC 237, this Court found on facts that a mutual fund had violated SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. Under the said Regulations there was a restriction placed on the mutual fund on purchasing or selling shares through any broker associated with the Sponsor of the mutual fund beyond a specified limit. It is in this context that the Division Bench of this Court held that mens rea was not an essential ingredient for contravention of the provisions of a civil act. The breach of a civil obligation which attracts penalty under the Act would immediately attract the levy of penalty irrespective of the fact whether the contravention was made by the defaulter with any guilty intention. It was further held that unless the language of the provision intends the need to establish mens rea, it is generally sufficient to prove the default/contravention in complying with the statute. In the present case also the statute provides for a hearing. However, that hearing is only to find out whether the assessee has contravened S. 78(2) and not to find out evasion of tax which function is assigned not to the officer at the check-post but to the A.O. in assessment proceedings. In the circumstances, we are of the view that mens rea is not an essential element in the matter of imposition of penalty under S. 78(5).
46.  We may mention some of the judgments cited on behalf of the assessees. Section 28-B of the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1948 came for interpretation before this Court in the case of Sodhi Transport Co. & Anr. Etc. Etc. v. State of U.P. & Anr. Etc. Etc. (1986) 1 SCR 939 1986 Indlaw SC 136. In that case the constitutional validity of Section 28-B of the said Act was challenged. It was held by this Court that since Section 28-B created rebuttable presumption as regards the proof of a set of circumstances, the effect of such a provision was to shift the burden of proving to the assessee who was given an opportunity to displace the presumption by leading evidence. This judgment has no application because the very words contained in Section 28-B required the authorities to raise a rebuttable presumption that the goods must have been sold in the State if the transit pass was not handed over at the check-post.
47. In the present case, we are not concerned with the transit pass. In the present case, there are no words in S. 78(5) similar to Section 28-B of the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1948 which states that if the transit pass was not handed over to the officer at the check-post, the Department would be entitled to raise the presumption that the goods in transit were sold in the State. As stated hereinabove, we have to go by the words used in the section to ascertain whether the legislature has excluded the element of mens rea . It is the statutory law enacted by the competent legislature which can exclude the presumption under common law. We hold that S. 78(5) excludes the presumption of mens rea which is normally prevailing in common law. Our reasoning is also based on one more factor, namely, that S. 78(5) provides a remedy for recovery of the loss caused to the State by such contravention.
48.  In the present case, the assessees have relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case of State of Rajasthan and Another v. D.P. Metals (2002) 1 SCC 279 2001 Indlaw SC 21394In that case the facts were as follows. The assessee firm manufactured stainless steel sheets. The assessee was a registered dealer. On 22.1.97 a truck was inspected by CTO. The same was found without Form 18A. A show cause notice was issued to the assessee. After hearing a penalty was levied under S. 78(5) of the RST Act 1994. It was held that under S. 78(5) levy of penalty was on the person incharge of the goods. It was held that the said penalty was leviable under two circumstances. Firstly, if there was non-compliance of S. 78(2)(a) of the said Act, namely, that it was not carrying the documents mentioned in that clause. Secondly, if false or forged documents/declaration was submitted then penalty under S. 78(5) was leviable.
49. After analyzing the said Section, this Court held that in the case of submission of false or forged documents/declaration, the authority was entitled to presume the motive to mislead the authorities. However, in such cases that presumption was rebuttable by the assessee on producing the requisite documents referred to in S. 78(2)(a). That, once the ingredient of S. 78(5) stood established after giving a hearing, there was no discretion with the officer to reduce the amount of penalty or to waive the penalty. If by mistake some of the documents were not readily available at the time of checking, principles of natural justice might require opportunity being given to produce the same. It was further held that under S. 78(5) the legislature has fixed the rate of penalty and, therefore, the quantum of penalty could not be waived or reduced.
50.  In our view, the aforestated judgment in the case of D.P. Metals 2001 Indlaw SC 21394 (supra) has no application to the present case. We are not concerned in the present case with false or forged documents/declaration. In the present case the goods in movement were carried with the blank declaration Form 18A/18C which was duly signed by the assessee. Therefore, as stated above, we hold that the goods in movement were carried without the declaration Form 18A/18C. Therefore, S. 78(2)(a) stood attracted. Moreover, in the present case, there were no special circumstances indicated by the assessee as to why the forms which were duly signed were not filled in. Therefore, in our view the above judgment in the case of D.P. Metals 2001 Indlaw SC 21394 (supra) has no application to the facts of the present case.
51. As stated, we are concerned with the blank declaration Form 18A/18C which has travelled with the goods in movement, though signed, was left deliberately blank. The declaration Form 18A/18C is like a return under the Income-Tax Act, 1961. The Assessing Officer completes the assessment on the basis of Form 18A/18C. If that form is left blank in all material respects then it is impossible for the A.O. to arrive at the taxable turnover of the assessee. Therefore, in our view, the judgment of this Court in D.P. Metals 2001 Indlaw SC 21394 (supra) has no application to the present case.
52.  Before concluding, we may mention that in this batch of civil appeals we have civil appeals filed by the Department. These civil appeals relate to cases where specified documents did not accompanied the goods in movement. The lead case in that regard is Civil Appeal No.5240 of 2005 Assistant Commercial Taxes Officer v. M/s. Guljag Industries Ltd. filed by the Department. We make it clear that our judgment is basically confined to cases where blank/incomplete Form 18A/18C had accompanied the goods in movement. Whatever we have stated above is in the context of the incomplete Form 18A/18C travelling along with the goods in movement.
However, Civil Appeal No.5240 of 2005 and such other civil appeals filed by the State (Department) are those cases where the documents were not accompanied the goods in movement, like, the bills of sale, bills of transport etc. In Civil Appeal No.5240 of 2005 the facts of which have been reproduced hereinabove, show that the case was confined to documents not accompanying the goods in movement. Therefore, the said appeals stand on a different footing. They have nothing to do with incomplete forms travelling along with the goods in movement. These civil appeals filed by the State (Department) shall be decided in the light of the judgment of this Court in D.P. Metals 2001 Indlaw SC 21394 (supra). However, cases where goods in movement were accompanied by Form No.18A/18C without duly signed but incomplete in material particulars like description of goods shall be governed by the law discussed hereinabove by us.
53.  For the aforestated reasons, we hold that S. 78(5) of the RST Act 1994 (Section 22A(7) of the RST Act 1954) is the section enacted to provide remedy for loss of revenue and it is not enacted to punish the offender for committing economic offence and, therefore, mens rea is not an essential ingredient for contravention of S. 78(2) of the RST Act 1994. That, the breach of S. 78(2) would attract the levy of penalty under S. 78(5) in cases where the goods in movement have travelled with an incomplete Form No.18A/18C. We accordingly uphold the judgment of the High Court of Rajasthan in Sales Tax Revision No.1023/2002 dated 14 October 2003 (which is annexed as page No.1 of the appeal paper book in Civil Appeal No.5197 of 2005 filed by M/s. Guljag Industries v. Commercial Taxes Officer 2007 Indlaw SC 888).
54.  In the light of our judgment, we direct the Department to dispose of the cases in accordance with law enunciated by us hereinabove. Accordingly the matters are remitted back to Commissioner (Appeals) to decide the matter in accordance with law enunciated by us hereinabove. The civil appeals, preferred by the State as well as by the assessees, are accordingly stand disposed of with no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
