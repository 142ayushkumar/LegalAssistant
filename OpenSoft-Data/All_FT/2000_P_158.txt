Prudential Capital Mkt. Limited and Another v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 April 2000
S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 1722 of 2000.
The order of the court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  An order of cognizance taken by the criminal court under sections 420, 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, as well as section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, not having been quashed by the High Court on an application being moved under section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, the present application has been filed in this court.
2.  We see no provision under the Reserve Bank of India Act which prohibits any criminal proceeding to be continued. The provision of section 58E bars taking cognizance of offence committed under the said Act, namely, the Reserve Bank of India Act.
3. The power of the Company Law Board under section 45QA of the Reserve Bank of India Act, as amended, does not in any way take away the power of the criminal court to continue with the criminal proceedings.
4.  In course of his arguments, learned counsel points out that several High Courts have stayed the criminal proceedings. We do not know under what circumstances, the High Courts have stayed the criminal proceedings, nor any provision has been shown to us. Be that as it may, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order. The special leave petition stands accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
