Union of India v Zalcon Electronics
Supreme Court of India

7 December 2007
C.A. No. 5741 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In our view, writ petition was not maintainable before the High Court. The facts required detailed adjudication. Adjudication was done by the competent authority. Assessee did not carry the matter in appeal to the Commissioner. Assessee straightway proceeded with the writ petition which was allowed by the High Court.
2. In the facts of this case, the approach of the High Court was wrong. The High Court should not have interfered with the order. It should have directed the assessee to exhaust the statutory remedy.
3.  In the circumstances, we set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court. Within eight weeks from today, the assessee will file the statutory appeal. The said appeal will not be dismissed on the ground of limitation if it is filed within the stipulated period.
It will be disposed of on its own merits, uninfluenced by the impugned judgment of the High Court.
Civil Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal Disposed of.
