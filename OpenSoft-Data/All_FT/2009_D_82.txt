Haryana Agricultural University v Devi Prakash & Ors
Supreme Court of India

30 April 2009
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1699 OF 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The appeal is directed against a judgment of the Punjab & Haryana High Court in a second appeal. No question of law was raised before the High Court. The finding of fact recorded by the District Judge which were endorsed by the High Court is that the respondents were technical hands and were matriculates with ITI certificates and were entitled to a pay scale of 1200-2040. The learned counsel for the appellant has sought to produce before us a document dated 18th September 1991. This document is subsequent to the suit and in any case was not exhibited in the present proceedings. We, therefore, decline the prayer of the learned counsel for the appellant to take this on record.
2.  In view of the above, we find no merit in this appeal. It is, accordingly, dismissed.
Appeal dismissed
