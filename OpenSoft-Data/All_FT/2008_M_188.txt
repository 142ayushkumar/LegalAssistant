Sakharam Ganesh Aaravandekar and another v Mahadeo Vinayak Mathkar and others
Supreme Court of India

28 August 2008
S.L.P. (C) No. 21361 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Taken on board. Heard learned counsel for the petitioners. We do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned order.
The special leave petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
2.  The petitioners are, however, granted time till 30-11-2008 to vacate the premises in question upon filing undertaking to this effect in this Court within four weeks from today.
3.  It is needless to say that in case the respondents feel aggrieved by this order, it would be open to them to move this Court for its recall.
4.  It is directed that in case the petitioners fail to vacate the premises in question within the aforesaid time, it would be open to the decree-holder to file an execution petition for delivery of possession and in case such a petition has been already filed, an application shall be filed therein to the effect that the petitioners have not vacated the premises in question within the time granted by this Court.
5.  In either eventuality, the executing court is not required to issue any notice to the petitioners. The executing court will see that delivery of possession is effected within a period of fifteen days from the date of filing of the execution petition or the application aforementioned.
6.  In case for delivery of possession any armed force is necessary, the same shall be deputed by the Superintendent of Police within forty eight hours from the date requisition is received therefor.
7.  It is also directed that in case anybody else, other than the petitioners, is found in possession, he shall also be dispossessed from the premises in question.
Petition dismissed.
