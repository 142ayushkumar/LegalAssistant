Kiran Ramanlal Jani v Gulam Kader and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 September 1994
Transfer Petitions (C) Nos. 793-94 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are told by the learned counsel for the petitioner that although the service is complete none has entered an appearance. The accident occurred near Banihar (State of Jammu and Kashmir) where the petitioner had been on holiday in 1988. He met with an accident in respect of which he filed a claim petition. He prays that the claim petition may be transferred to Gujarat since it is not convenient for him to go to the State of Jammu and Kashmir again and again for contesting the petition.
2.   Since there is no objection entered, we allow these transfer petitions and direct that the claim petitions will stand transferred to the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (Ahmedabad City Civil Court) for disposal in accordance with law. The Principal Judge of the Ahmedabad City Civil Court will assign the matter to the claims tribunal concerned on the papers being laid before him. No costs.
Petition allowed.
