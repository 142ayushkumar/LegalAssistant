State of Uttar Pradesh v Matloob Bhattu and Anr
Supreme Court of India

21 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2612/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The following impugned order passed by the High Court cannot be sustained .
"This appeal was filed on 17th August 1999 without mentioning the parentage and addresses of the accused opposite parties.Four years have passed. We do not find any good ground to grant further time to remove the defect in appeal. The application seeking leave to appeal is rejected for want to prosecution. The appeal is rejected."
2.  Question is - to what extent this type of short cut for disposing of criminal appeal should be adopted? It is true that in prosecution of serious cases or in appeal against such orders, State is the only party to protect the victims. But in case either inadvertently or by negligence, appropriate steps are not taken by the Investigating Officer or the Government pleader in not removing office objection by giving complete address of the accused, it would not be just and proper to dismiss the matter.
3. In such cases, it is easy to adopt a coercive measure for affecting service on the accused either by issuing bailable or non-bailable warrants as the case may require and the Investigating Officer is bound to execute such directions. Considering the facts, the impugned order passed by the High Court requires to be set aside.
4.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents states that the respondents would appear before the High Court on a fixed date and would file necessary appearance before the High Court within four weeks from today.Hence, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order passed by the High Court is quashed and set aside. The High Court to decide the appeal on merits.
Appeal allowed.
