State of Punjab Th. Secretary and Others v Gopal Singh
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.9432/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave is granted.
1.  The State of Punjab and some other officers have filed this appeal challenging the judgment/order passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court allowing the writ petition filed by the respondent. The High Court directed the appellants to count ad hoc service of the respondent for the purpose of granting him benefit of proficiency step up, relying on the Division Bench judgment in the case of Harjinder Kaur & Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Ors. CMP No.11704/89 decided on 24.4.1996.
2. This decision has been set aside by this Court in State of Haryana vs. Haryana Veterinary & AHTS Asson. and Anr. reported in 2000 Indlaw SC 2979 in which it has been held inter alia that ad hoc service of an employee is not to be counted for the purpose of computation of requisite experience for proficiency step up under the Rules. This position is fairly accepted by learned counsel for the respondent.
3.  In that view of the matter the judgment/order of the High Court under challenge is unsustainable and has to be set aside.
4.  The appeal is allowed and the judgment dated 8.8.2001 in CWP No.11873 of 1998 is set aside. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
