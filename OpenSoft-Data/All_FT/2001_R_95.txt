Supreme Court of India

31 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.1494/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Rajasthan Public Service Commission, the petitioner before us conducted certain selection process for recruitment of Sub-Inspectors of Police on a requisition made by the State of Rajasthan. In a petition filed by one of the persons, i.e. the respondent No.1, who participated in the process of selection but did not get through, the High Court has issued directions upholding his selection and, consequent thereupon, right to appointment. The petitioner has been directed to draw up a fresh list of selected candidates consistently with the view of the law taken by the High Court though the appointments already made are not to be disturbed.
2.  The State of Rajasthan has chosen not to file any appeal against the impugned judgment of the High Court.
3.  The Rajasthan Public Service Commission has filed the present special leave petition.
4.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties we are satisfied that Rajasthan Public Service Commission cannot be said to be a `person aggrieved' by the impugned judgment of the High Court.
5. We are, therefore, not inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment at the instance of the Rajasthan Public Service Commission.
Leave to file appeal is refused.
The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
