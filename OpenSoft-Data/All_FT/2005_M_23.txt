Commissioner of Collegiate Education v M. Madhusudhan Reddy and another
Supreme Court of India

8 April 2005
C.A. No. 2497 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 17400 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  We see no reason to interfere with the impugned order especially having regard to the fact that the appellant has not come forward even now with specific details which the appellant omitted to place before the High Court. These details which ought to have been furnished relate to the date on which and the order by which the respondent M.Madhusudhan Reddy was fixed against the unaided post and whether full salary admissible to the aided post was being drawn by him during the relevant period.
2.  The pension of the respondent shall therefore be refixed on the footing that the service rendered by him between 1972, and 31-3-1980, shall be deemed to be against an aided post. The process of refixation shall be completed and the pensionary benefits should be released to the respondent within a period of four months from today.
3. It is made clear that the respondent shall not be entitled to any arrears of salary in view of the stand taken by the respondent that he was drawing full salary admissible to an aided post during the crucial period.
The appeal is dismissed subject to the above observation/direction.
Appeal dismissed.
