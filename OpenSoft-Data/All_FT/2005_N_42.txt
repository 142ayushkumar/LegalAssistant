Narender Kumar Sharma v Manoj Chowdhary and others
Supreme Court of India

30 September 2005
Cr.As. Nos. 1267 and 1268 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (Cri.) Nos. 3290 and 3294 of 2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The challenge in these appeals is to the order of the High Court granting bail to Manoj Chowdhary and Sushil Choudhary who were involved in the offence under Sections 147,148,149,302,307,404/34 IPC in Crime Case No.88 of 2004, PS Jarcha, District Gautam Budh Nagar. The High Court has granted bail solely on the ground that only one single firearm injury was sustained by the deceased. The appellant has filed the criminal history-sheet of the accused in which the accused are involved in a series of crimes including murder. Considering this fact, we are of the view that the High Court was not justified in granting bail. The bail granted by the High Court is, accordingly, set aside and cancelled. The respondent-accused are directed to be taken into custody forthwith.
The appeals are allowed.
Appeals allowed.
