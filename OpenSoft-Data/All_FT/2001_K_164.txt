Kashinathsingh v Nanded Municipal Corporation, Nanded and Others
Supreme Court of India

31 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14588-14589/2000
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The resolution of the Municipal Council in favour of upgradation of the Pay-Scale of Assistant Octroi Superintendent was not approved by the State Government in exercise of its power under the Municipal Act. Even if the power would be there, then there must be some good reasons in not approving the same. Mr. Deshpande, who appears both for the Municipal Council and also for the State Government, states that the Government has not been able to get the relevant documents non-approving the resolution of the Municipal Council, and he may be granted some time to produce the same.
2. We grant 4 weeks time to the State of Maharashtra to produce the relevant order of the State Government not approving the resolution of the Municipal Council.
Order accordingly.
