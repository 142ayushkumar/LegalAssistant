Union Of India v Madanlal Steel Industries Ltd
Supreme Court of India

1 August 2001
C.A. No. 4736 of 1991, Dt. 1 August 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It appears that the present appeal has become infructuous. The respondent had imported stainless steel sheets and declared it as scrap. On the confiscation of the same, writ petition was filed and on dismissal of the same a writ appeal was filed. By the impugned judgment, the Division Bench of the High Court directed the customs authorities to consider an application under Section 24 of the Customs Act for mutilation and release of the stainless steel sheets so imported. From order dated 18th November, 1991 of this Court, it appears that some goods have been mutilated and released to the respondent. As orders of stay had been passed on 2nd December, 1991 by this Court, some part of the goods was not mutilated. Counsel for the respondent states that in respect thereof, redemption fine of Rs. 3 lakhs and duty of Rs. 25 lakhs have been imposed by order dated 26th December, 1991 passed by the Collector. The said duty and fine have been paid and the order of the Collector has now become final.
2. In view of the aforesaid, it is quite clear that nothing else survives in this appeal except that we see little justification in a matter like this for the High Court to have granted any relief to the respondent in the manner it did. Once goods which are imported are misdeclared, there was no reason whatsoever for the High Court even entertaining a writ petition leave alone granting any relief which, to our mind, was uncalled for. As the matter has now become infructuous, nothing further need be said.
3.  The appeal is dismissed as infructuous, but with the aforesaid observations.
Appeal dismissed.
