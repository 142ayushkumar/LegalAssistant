News Item "Hindustan Times" A.Q.F.M. Yamuna v Central Pollution Control Board and Another
Supreme Court of India

24 January 2000
Ias Nos. 5-10 In W.P. (C) No. 725 of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Affidavit of the Chief Secretary has been filed which seems to indicate that orders which were passed by us earlier directing that the pollution of River Yamuna should be stopped with effect from 1-11-1999 have not been complied with. This is so especially in view of the report which has been filed by the Central Pollution Control Board which shows that the situation is alarming. For example, BOD which should be at 2 in respect of fresh water, was at 234.21 tons per day on 30-11-1999. The position with regard to the other pollutants is no better.
2. In a hope that the Attorney General will be able to take effective steps with a view to achieve the desired result, we adjourn this matter to 3-3-2000.
3.  We, however, in the meantime direct every industry in Delhi not to discharge their effluent into any drain leading to River Yamuna or to River Yamuna itself which has the effect of polluting the said river. This order prohibiting every industry from discharging the effluent which causes pollution, will be communicated to every industry by the Delhi administration.
4.  The Central Pollution Control Board will file a fresh report giving the state of water as on 1-3-2000.
5.  This order prohibiting contaminated discharge will also operate in respect of industries in Haryana which will be informed by the State of Haryana.
Order accordingly.
