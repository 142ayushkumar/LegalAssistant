Harbans Sharma v Pritam Kaur
Supreme Court of India

13 March 1981
C.A. No. 1041 of 1981
The order of the court is as follows:
Heard counsel. Special leave granted.
1.  We are not satisfied that the High Court was justified in dismissing the revision application summarily. Even assuming that the High Court came to the conclusion that there was no substance in the arguments advanced on behalf of the tenant, the High Court could have indicated its brief reasons in support of the view it took.
2. In these circumstances we hive no option save to set aside the order of the High Court and remand the matter to It for disposal in accordance with law after hearing both the sides. The High Court shall take up for hearing the revision application expeditiously since the proceedings have been pending since 1968.
There will be no order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
