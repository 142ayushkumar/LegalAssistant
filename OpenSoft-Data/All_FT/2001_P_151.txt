Indian Drug Distributors and Others v Pranab Kumar Banerjee and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10919/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard learned counsel and it appears to us that the impugned order goes far beyond the court's jurisdiction in a review.
2. If the contesting respondent was aggrieved by the original order, his remedy was to take appropriate proceedings there against. Learned counsel for the contesting respondent says that this shall now be done.
3.  Accordingly, without going into any further details, we allow the appeal and set aside the order under challenge.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
