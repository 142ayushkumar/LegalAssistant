The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. The appellants approached this Court aggrieved by the insufficiency of the compensation of their lands acquired by the respondents. The notice in this case was limited to the entitlement of enhancement based on cumulative basis. The notice reads as follows :-
".......
Issue notice in both the Special Leave Petitions limited to the claim for enhancement on the basis of 15% annual increase cumulatively, as has been granted in other cases."
3. There is no dispute that in similar cases, the enhancement was granted by this Court with the compensation calculated on the basis of 15% increase on cumulative basis. Therefore, these appeals are allowed and the Judgment, as far as the annual increase is concerned, shall stand substituted as follows :-
"All the appellants will be entitled to 15% increase at Rs. 192 per sq. yard for the gap period of two years and six months on cumulative basis."
There shall be no order as to costs.
