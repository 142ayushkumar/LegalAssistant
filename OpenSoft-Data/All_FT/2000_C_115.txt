Tata Iron and Steel Company v Collector of Central Excise, Calcutta
Supreme Court of India

6 November 2000
C.A..No.4447/2000 (for preliminary hearing)
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The interpretation placed on the Exemption Notification by the Assistant Collector was upheld in appeal by the Collector (Appeals). The Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT), by a detailed order, has agreed with that reasoning.
We are not inclined to take a different view.
The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
