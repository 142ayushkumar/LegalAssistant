Calcutta in APOT No. 373, 375-379 of 2001 in GA No. 2105, 2107-2111and GA No. 2212-2216, 2238 of 2001)
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having heard learned Additional Solicitor General for quite sometime, we are not persuaded to interfere with the order under challenge as the said order is an interlocutory order.
The High Court itelf gave liberty to mention for early hearing.
2.  We have no doubt that on such mention being made, the case would be disposed of expeditiously. Learned Additional Solitor General seeks time for complying with the order of the learned Single Judge, without prejudice to the contentions of the petitioners in appeal before the High Court.
3. We grant 8 weeks time for compliance, which shall be subject to the result of the appeal.
4.  Subject to the above observations, the Special Leave Petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
