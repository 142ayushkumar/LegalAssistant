M V Daniel v M V Baby (Dead) and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12754-12755/1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant herein was the plaintiff in Suit No. 469/86 for recovery of possession of land measuring 14 cents. In the said suit, respondents were impleaded as defendant Nos. 1-3. Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 are the parents of defendant No. 3. The said suit was decreed ex-parte. Subsequently, the appellant put the decree in execution. In the said proceedings the respondents judgment debtor took an objection that since defendant No. 3 was a minor on the date of filing of the suit, therefore, the decree is void and cannot be executed.
2.  The said objection of the respondents was upheld by the executing court. Consequently, the execution proceedings were struck off. A revision petition was filed before the High Court but the same was dismissed. It is against the said judgment of the High Court, the appellant-decree-holder has come to this Court.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
3. We are of the view that where a suit is filed against a minor without appointing a guardian ad litem and subsequently a decree is passed by the Court, it is open to the minor to object before the executing court that such a decree is void. In the present case, what we find is that defendant No. 3 was minor on the date of filing of the suit. It is not disputed that no guardian was appointed for defendant No. 3.
4.  In that view of the matter, the decree passed by the Court against defendant No. 3 was void and it could not have been executed against defendant No. 3. We are, therefore, in agreement with the view taken by the High Court.Consequently, the appeals fail and are dismissed accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
