Ramesh Chandra Mishra and Others v Vijay Shankar and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 April 1981
C.As. Nos. 1387-1390 of 1981.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard counsel. Special leave granted.
1.  The directions given by the High Court in its order dated February 25, 1981, as also the directions given in the judgment in Review Application on April 2, 1981, are likely create needless complications. On the whole, it will be in the interest of the parties that no interim seniority list is drawn up as directed by the High Court.
2. We, therefore, direct that the interim direction given by the High Court in regard to the drawing up of the seniority list shall not be carried out until the final disposal of the writ petitions filed in the High Court. Such promotions and any further promotions made in accordance with the impugned seniority list will abide by the result of the writ petitions. The High Court will dispose of the writ petitions before the end of August, 1981.
The appeals shall stand disposed of in terms of this order.
There will be no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
