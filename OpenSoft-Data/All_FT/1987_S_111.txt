Smt. Dhan Mal Devi Jain v Goverdhan Dass and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 March 1987
C.A. No. 3505 of 1984
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1. The decision of the Constitution Bench in Smt. Gian Devi Anand v. Jeevan Kumar, 1985 Indlaw SC 4161985 Indlaw SC 4161985 Indlaw SC 416, has now settled the conflict between the decision of this Court in Damadilal v. Parashram, 1976 Indlaw SC 3861976 Indlaw SC 386, taking a view upon the construction of the definition of the term 'tenant' u/s. 2(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961 as including a statutory tenant and also holding that the right is a heritable one, and the view to the contrary expressed in Ganpat Lodha v. Sashikant Vishnu Shinde, 1978 Indlaw SC 3221978 Indlaw SC 3221978 Indlaw SC 322, upon a construction of the work 'tenant' as defined in S. 5(11)(c) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 regarding the nature of statutory tenants and its heritability.
The Court has held in Smt. Gian Devi Anand case 1985 Indlaw SC 4161985 Indlaw SC 4161985 Indlaw SC 416 of the Report expressly overruled the view taken in Ganpat Ladha case  1978 Indlaw SC 3221978 Indlaw SC 3221978 Indlaw SC 322.
2. In the present case, the High Court has rightly held that on the death of the statutory tenant Ghotan Mal having occurred on December 9, 1972 i.e. prior to the date when the Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973 came into operation, the rights were governed by the provisions of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949. It is to be noticed that the definition of the term 'tenant' as contained in S. 2(1) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 was almost identical with the definition of the term in S. 2(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961.
3. That being so, the right of a statutory tenant was heritable. In view of the decision of the Constitution Bench in Smt. Gian Anand case 1985 Indlaw SC 4161985 Indlaw SC 4161985 Indlaw SC 416, we must hold that the right of the statutory tenant in respect of non-residential accommodation is heritable.
4. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
