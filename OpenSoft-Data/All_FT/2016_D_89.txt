1. Delay condoned.
2. Leave granted.
3. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the award could not be passed on account of the operation of stay. Apparently, there is no stay after 2010. If that be so, there is no merit in the contention taken by the appellant that the stay order granted by the Court prevented the award being passed within the time permitted under Section 11A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
4. Therefore, this appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed
