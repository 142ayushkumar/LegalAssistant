Delhi Development Authority v Radha Nagpal and others
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2016
Civil Appeal No. 12072 of 2016 [@ Special Leave Petition (C) No. 36617 of 2016 [@ Special Leave Petition (C).....CC No. 23707 of 2016
(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. Delay condoned.
2. Leave granted.
3. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the award could not be passed on account of the operation of stay. Apparently, there is no stay after 2010. If that be so, there is no merit in the contention taken by the appellant that the stay order granted by the Court prevented the award being passed within the time permitted under Section 11A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
4. Therefore, this appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed
