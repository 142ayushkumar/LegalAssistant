State of Tamil Nadu v Srinivasa Timber Depot. (And Others Appeals)
Supreme Court of India

23 October 1990
C.As. Nos. 874 to 881 of 1976. Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 19 July 1973, of the Madras High Court in Tax Cases Nos. 16, 78 to 82, 86 and 87 of 1970. The judgment of the High Court is reported at [1974] 33 STC 423
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties we are of the opinion that the High Court placed reliance on its earlier judgment in Srinivasa Timber Depot v. Deputy Commercial Tax Officer, in holding that the lot cooly charges are collected de hors the sale and such charges do not form part of the turnover.
2.   This view has held the field in the State of Tamil Nadu for the last 21 years, which is consistent with the provisions of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959. We find no good reason to take a different view. The appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed, but there will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
