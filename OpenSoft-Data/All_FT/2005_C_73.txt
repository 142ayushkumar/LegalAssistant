Chief Secretary, Haryana and another v Chet Ram
Supreme Court of India

26 April 2005
C.A. No. 55 of 2004
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The case of the appellant State that the services of the respondent were terminated as contemplated under Section 2(oo) of the Industrial Disputes Act the employment being under contract has been disbelieved by the Tribunal.
2. Since no material whatsoever was produced by the appellant to establish such a contract, therefore, the Tribunal was justified in coming to the conclusion that the termination of the respondent workman was in contravention of Section 25-F of the Act because no enquiry was conducted before passing the order of termination. The High Court has accepted this finding and we do not find any merit in this appeal.
3.  Learned counsel for the appellant, however, contended that the amount of 50% back wages on the facts and circumstances of this case is excessive. We do not think so.
4. The High Court has taken note of the fact in regard to the employment of the appellant after the termination of his services, therefore, granted only 50% which on the facts of this case is not excessive.
5.  With the reasons abovestated, this appeal fails and the same is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
