Supreme Court of India

30 August 2005
C.A. No. 5356 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Two notices were issued to the respondent Company by the Deputy Labour Commissioner on the basis that the respondent had violated the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and particularly Section 25-0 thereof. The two notices were challenged by the respondent under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Allahabad High Court. The ground of challenge was that the State Act, namely, the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 applied and not the Industrial Disputes Act which was a Central Act.
2. This issue must be taken to have been concluded by this Court in the decision of Engg. Kamgar Union v. Electro Steels Castings Ltd.2004 Indlaw SC 354 which held that the State Act would apply.
3.  According to the appellant workman there has also been a violation of the provisions of Section 6-W read with Section 6-V of the State Act by the respondent Company. That was not the subject-matter of the proceedings before the High Court.
4. If the appellant is of the view that a dispute may be legally raised with regard to the alleged violation of the provisions of the State Act by the respondent Company, it may do so in accordance with law. The judgment of the High Court is confirmed. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with the aforesaid observations.
Appeal dismissed.
