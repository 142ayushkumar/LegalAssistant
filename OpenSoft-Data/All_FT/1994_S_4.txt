S. D. K. Puri v R. S. Bhatia and Another
Supreme Court of India

17 March 1994
C.A. No. 188 of 1983
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against the judgment of the Division Bench of the Punjab & Haryana High Court dated 10-4-1980, whereby the Letters Patent Appeal filed by the appellant against the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated 28-1-1980, has been dismissed in limine.
2.   The learned Single Judge by his judgment aforementioned has held that in view of the provisions contained in Rules 7 and 7-A of the Punjab Service of Engineers (Electricity Branch) Recruitment and Conditions (Service Rules), 1939 the inter se seniority of the appellant and Respondent 1 has to be determined on the basis of the date of joining on the post of Assistant Engineer and since Respondent 1 had joined as Assistant Engineer earlier than the appellant, he would rank senior to the appellant.
3.  We have heard Shri K. K. Mohan, the learned counsel for the appellant. We are of the view that the High Court has not committed any error in applying the said rules and in holding Respondent 1 as senior to the appellant.
The appeal, therefore, fails and is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
