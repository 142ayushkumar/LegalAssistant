State of Punjab v Dharminder Kumar Alias Kaka
Supreme Court of India

24 January 1994
Cr.A. No. ... of 1994 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 2405 of 1993)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted. Heard both sides.
1.  Obviously the trial court has passed the order granting bail to the respondent-accused in breach of Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. In fact, the order granting bail states that it cannot be said at this stage as to whether the accused is guilty of the offence or not.
2.   In the circumstances, the order of the trial court granting bail was prima facie illegal. Unfortunately, the High Court while confirming the bail, also failed to notice the provisions of Section 37 of the said Act. In the circumstances, we set aside the orders of the High Court as well as of the trail court and direct the issue of non-bailable warrant against the accused. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
