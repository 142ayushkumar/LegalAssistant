Malay Ganguly v Medical Council of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 October 2001
W.P. (C) No. 317 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr. Maninder Singh, counsel for Respondent 1, has drawn our attention to some of the salient provisions of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.
2. It may be desirable that there should be like the Advocates Act, a comprehensive provision made in the Medical Council Act relating not only to the Medical Council of India but also to the State Medical Councils.
3.  As this would involve Central legislation, we think it appropriate to implead the Union of India as one of the respondents in this case and we direct notice to be issued to the Union of India returnable after four weeks. Dasti service in addition is permitted.
4.  On the next date of hearing, counsel representing the different Medical Councils should place on record the respective State Acts.
List after four weeks.
Order accordingly.
