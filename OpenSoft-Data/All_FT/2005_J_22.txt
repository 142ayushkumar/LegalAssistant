Supreme Court of India

10 January 2005
Cr.A. No. 51 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 3757 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  The anticipatory bail petition has been rejected by the High Court on the premise that the main allegations giving rise to the offence under Ss. 323 and 498-A of the Indian Penal Code are against the brother of the husband i.e. the petitioner herein.
2. However, having perused the complaint lodged by the informant with the police according to which the main allegations are against the husband who is in jail and considering the uncontroverted allegation that the petitioner and the accused husband, have not been living together for a long time, we consider it a fit case to grant anticipatory bail.
3.  Accordingly, the anticipatory bail is granted subject to the conditions as laid down in Sec. 438(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. We shall not be understood to have expressed any view on the merits of the case. The appeal is disposed of accordingly
Appeal disposed of.
