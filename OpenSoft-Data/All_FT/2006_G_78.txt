C.A. No. 2749 of 2006 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 10120 of 2006)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave granted.
The appeal is disposed of with the following directions:
1. Undisputedly, show-cause notice has been issued on 24-5-2006. But issuance of show-cause notice does not necessarily mean that further investigation cannot be done. This position is conceded. At the same time investigation should be completed within a reasonable time. The observations in the High Court's impugned order are clarified to the aforesaid extent.
Appeal disposed of.
