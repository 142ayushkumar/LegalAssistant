Commissioner and Dir. of Industry and Others v Messrs M.K. Vinyl P. Limited
Supreme Court of India

17 July 2001
Review Petition(Civil) No.737/2001 in S.L.P.(Civil)No.2718/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
These cases are connected.
1.  The Review Petitions are presented after the expiry of the period of limitation. No sufficient cause is shown to condone the delay.
2.  We have gone through the order sought to be reviewed, the review petition and the annexures thereto. We find no valid ground to interfere with the order under review.
3. In the order under review this Court declined to condone the delay in filing the Special Leave Petitions. It is surprising that even the review petitions are filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation.
The Review Petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
