Sacs Eagles Chicory v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

21 March 2002
C.A. No. 5877 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question to be considered reads thus:-"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the assessee-firm is an industrial undertaking eligible for deduction under sections 80HH, 80-1, 80] of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ?"
1998 Indlaw MAD 594
2.  All that is on record in regard to the "process" that the assessee carries on is stated in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax thus:
"But if an analysis of the activity of making powder from the chicory roots is made, it will be found out that there are only two processes in making the powder from chicory roots,
(i) roots are roasted, and
(ii) after that they are powdered."
3.  We have asked learned counsel for the assessee whether there is anything else that describes the process. There is apparently nothing else. If that is the only process, it does not satisfy the test laid down by this court in Aspinwall and Co. Ltd. v. CIT 2001 Indlaw SC 57.
The civil appeal is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
