U. P. Coop. Land Development Bank Limited v Bhagwat Prasad and others
Supreme Court of India

18 February 2005
S.L.P. (C) No. 17655 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard the petitioner's counsel and the counsel for the respondents. Counsel for the petitioner submits that the High Court disposed of the matter without hearing the petitioner's counsel. This fact is denied by the counsel for the respondents.
2. However, the impugned order shows that the petitioner's counsel alone was heard. Counsel for the petitioner Bank was changed but the name of the new counsel was not found in the list because of some mistake which has crept in.
3.  This matter relates to the disciplinary proceedings in respect of the respondents. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court. The writ petition filed before the High Court would stand restored to the file and shall be considered afresh by the High Court.
4. We request the High Court to dispose of the matter afresh in accordance with law. The counsel for the petitioner is directed to pay costs of Rs. 10,000/- to the respondent's counsel within four weeks from today. Accordingly, the SLP is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
