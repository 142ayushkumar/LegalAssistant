City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Limited v Federal Bank Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

24 November 2000
CA No. .... of 2000 [arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 5687/2000]
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the High Court ought not to have directed the return of money by the appellants which was the only prayer in the writ petitions. In this way, at the interlocutory stage, the writ petitions themselves were allowed.
2.  We, accordingly, allow these appeals and set aside the orders of the High Court but request the High Court to dispose of the writ petitions pending before it as expeditiously as possible preferably within a period of four months. It will be open to the parties to raise such contentions before the High Court as may be available to them.
Appeals allowed.
