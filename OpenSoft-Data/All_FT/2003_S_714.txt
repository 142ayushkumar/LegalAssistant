Public Union For Civil Liberties v State of Tamil Nadu and others
Supreme Court of India

8 October 2003
W.P. (C) No. 3922 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is stated by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the States of Haryana, Karnataka and Rajasthan that these States have filed the status reports before the National Human Rights Commission. They will affirm affidavits to the effect within a week from date. As far as the States of Gujarat, Uttaranchal and Kerala are concerned, they have already filed their status reports with NHRC. Despite the fact that more than two months have passed since this Court directed the States of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and the Union of India to file their status reports with NHRC they have failed to do so.
2. We give a last opportunity to these States to file their response in compliance with this Court's order within a week failing which contempt proceedings will be taken against the Chief Secretaries of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and the Secretary concerned of the Union of India. No further time will be granted.
The matter is adjourned for one week.
Order accordingly.
