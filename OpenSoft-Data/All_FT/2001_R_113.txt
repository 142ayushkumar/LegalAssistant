State of Bihar and Others v Rajendra Paswan
Supreme Court of India

24 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)......./2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  High Court has pointed out that it was not open to the petitioners to contend that respondent was not appointed as Excise Constable as he had received posting and transfer orders from time to time. If this finding is correct, it is for the State Government to take appropriate action against the concerned officers who passed such orders for posting and transfer. But it cannot be said that the order passed by the High Court is in any way illegal or erroneous which would call for interference u/art. 136 of the Constitution.
2. However, learned counsel for the petitioners subsmits that on the same ground respondent has filed CWJC No.2128/88 before the High Court and that writ petition was dismissed on merits. It appears that this contention was not raised before the High Court. Therefore, no interfernce is called for in this petition. The special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.
3.  However, it would be open to the petitioners to approach the High Court for review of the order if as a matter of fact on the same point earlier writ petition filed by the petitioners was dismissed.
Petition Dismissed.
