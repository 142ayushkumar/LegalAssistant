Moideen Hajee under a sale deed executed by Defendants 1 to 4 and one Gopalan Nambiar. The Subordinate Judge, Tellicherry, passed a decree for Rs. 200/- and proportionate costs and dismissed the suit for damages. Against that decree an appeal was preferred to the High Court of Kerala. The case was referred to a Full Bench. By a majority judgment the High Court set aside the decree passed by the Trial Court and remanded the case with a direction to restore it to its Original Number and to dispose it of
"in accordance with law and in the light of the observations contained in the judgment"
2.  In our judgment the High Court was not competent to issue a certificate. It is true that one of the questions in dispute between the parties was determined, viz., the right of the plaintiff to claim damages; but the quantum of damages was not determined, and for determining damages payable by the appellants the suit was remanded to the Court of First Instance. Such an order cannot be said to be a final order. The High Court was, in our view, incompetent to issue the certificate. The certificate is vacated.
3.  We may make it clear that it will be open to the aggrieved party it hereafter there is occasion to file an appeal to this Court to challenge the correctness of the judgment of the High Court in such an appeal.
4.  The appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal Dismissed.
