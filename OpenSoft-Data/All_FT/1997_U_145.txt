Chetna, Legal Advisory W. C. D. Society v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 October 1997
W.P. (C) No. 297 of 1995
The Order of the Court ws as follows:
1.  The learned Solicitor General has produced before us a copy of the National Programme of Action for Eradication of Female Foeticide and Infanticide of 1995 by the Department of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India. The learned amicus curiae has some more suggestions to offer which have been handed over to the learned Solicitor General who would look into them and take the necessary action.
2.  In view of the exercise having been commenced by the Government of India and a National Programme of Action being drawn up which also takes note of the role of the NGOs concerned with this kind of work, we do not think it necessary to proceed this matter in the Court for the present. However, if at any subsequent stage it becomes necessary to seek any directions of the Court, it would be open to an appropriate party like the present petitioner to move the Court in this behalf. We may also observe that if need be, the National Human Rights Commission can also be approached in this matter to solicit the assistance of the Commission in proper implementation of this National Programme and its improvement wherever necessary.
The writ petition is disposed of in this manner.
Petition disposed of.
