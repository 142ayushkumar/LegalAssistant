District Rural Development Agency, Hisar v Smt. Santosh Kumari
Supreme Court of India

31 March 2003
C.A. No. .... of 2003 Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 1115 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.Leave granted.
2.  The appellant's sole grievance before this Court is that despite several issues raised involving serious questions of law arose, the High Court has ignored the same. These issues included the question whether the appellant would be an 'industry' within the meaning of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short 'the Act'). According to the appellant this issue has been concluded in the appellant's favour by the decision of this Court in State of U.P. and others vs. Arun Kumar Singh reported in 1995 Indlaw SC 1667.
3. It is further submitted that in any event by virtue of the provisions of Section 2(OO) Clause-bb of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, there was no question of the appellant being bound to comply with the conditions precedent for retrenchment as laid down by Section 25F of the Act.
4.  Since the issues had been specifically raised by the appellant even before the Labour Court it is incumbent upon the High Court to decide them.
The order of the High Court is, therefore, set aside and the matter is remanded back to it for determination of the issues raised by the appellant.
5.The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of without any order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
