Shiv Prakash Yadav and Others v Sakaldeep Yadav and Anr
Supreme Court of India

20 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2345/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The contention of the petitioner is that the High Court has not taken into account the direction issued by this Court in Raj Deo Sharma vs. State of Bihar and Raj Deo Sharma II vs. State of Bihar.
2. Evidently because this has not been brought to the notice of the High Court. As now the matter is back before the trial court it is open for the defence to file a petition before the trial court highlighting the directions contained in the aforesaid decisions. Before taking decision on the said petitions the trial court shall give due notice to the prosecution also and hear both sides and then only pass orders untrammelled by any observation made in the impugned order. With these observations this SLP is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
