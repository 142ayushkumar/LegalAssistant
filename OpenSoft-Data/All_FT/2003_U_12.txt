U.P. Forest Corporation Lucknow and another v Vinod Kumar Srivastava
Supreme Court of India

24 January 2003
C.A. No. 558 of 2003 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 12031 of 2002)
The Order of the Court is as follows
Leave granted.
1.  The respondent herein was dismissed from service on the ground of unauthorised leave after a departmental inquiry. He challenged the same before the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. The Division Bench which entertained the writ petition while admitting the writ petition made the following interim order:
"We stay the operation of the impugned order dated 24.1.2002 till further orders.
We make it clear that we are prima facie satisfied that the punishment given to the petitioner is disproportionate to the charge, although the petitioner deserves some punishment.
We direct for the reinstatement of the petitioner but the quantum of punishment will be decided on the next date and after perusal of the counter affidavit."
2.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. We are satisfied that the High Court has fallen in error in passing the impugned order which is in the nature of a final order at the stage of preliminary hearing. The factual situation of this case is not such that the relief could not have been postponed till the final disposal of the petition. For the reasons stated above, this appeal succeeds and the same is allowed, setting aside the impugned order.
Appeal allowed.
