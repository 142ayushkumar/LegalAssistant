Commissioner & Secy. to Govt. of Haryana and another v Pale Ram
Supreme Court of India

14 January 2003
C.A. No. 2484 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The State of Haryana challenges the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The respondent herein was engaged as a daily wager by the Agricultural Department of the State of Haryana, in the office of the Assistant Plant and Protection Officer (Agriculture). The services of the respondent as a daily wager were terminated. The termination was challenged before the Labour Court.
2. The appellants herein contended that the respondent had not worked for more than 240 days. Labour Court did not accept this plea and ordered reinstatement with full back wages. The appellants herein challenged the Award before the High Court. The High Court did not accept the plea of the appellant. Hence, this appeal by special leave.
3.  The counsel for the appellant submits that the Department of Agriculture is not an "industry" and therefore, the Industrial Disputes Act has no application. Though a plea was raised before the Labour Court, no materials were placed to decide whether the Agricultural Department is an "industry" or not. Before the High Court also the appellant could not substantiate this plea. There is nothing on record to decide this question effectively. As the point urged by the appellant is a larger question, we leave open the same to be decided in appropriate case.
The appeal is without any merits and the same is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
