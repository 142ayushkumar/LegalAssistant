The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Having heard the learned counsel, we are not inclined to interfere with the order under challenge. However, it is brought to our notice that pursuant to the order of the High Court the petitioners have not filed undertaking within the time granted by it, therefore, they will not be able to avail the benefit of order of the High Court granting stay of eviction.
2. We grant two weeks time from today for filing the undertaking in the High Court. If the undertaking is filed within the said period, the petitioners will have the advantage of the order of the High Court with regard to time for vacating the premises. The S.L.P. is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
