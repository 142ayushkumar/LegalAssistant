State of Kerala v Kumari T. P. Roshana and Another
Supreme Court of India

20 April 1981
Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 6945 of 1981 (in C.A. No. 2297 of 1978).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing learned counsel it seems to us desirable to modify the terms of the direction contained in the judgment of this Court dated January 17, 1979 ,State of Kerala v. T.P. Roshana, 1979 Indlaw SC 296 requiring the universities to draw up a uniform curriculum and a common examination system and allied matters.
2. It appears that the universities concerned have made a serious attempt to comply with the direction but the they do not find it possible to make full compliance because, it is said, local conditions governing the two universities prevent them from doing so. Perhaps having regard to the peculiar conditions governing the working of each university and the needs which they are intended to satisfy it is not possible to achieve the result intended by the Order of this Court.
3.  In the circumstances we think it appropriate to relax the rigidity of the direction made by this court, and for the original Order we substitute the Order that the two universities shall, to the extent reasonably possible, draw up a uniform curriculum and arrange for a common examination system in order to reduce the inequality (where the removal of complete inequality is not possible) between the students belonging to one university or the other within the State.
Order accordingly.
