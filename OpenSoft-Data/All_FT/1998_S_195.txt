1.  Heard learned Counsel for the parties. After hearing learned Counsel, we are of the view that Suit No. 2 of 1998, pending in the Court of Additional District Judge, Ambala which now stands transferred to the Punjab & Haryana High Court, because of the application for revocation filed by the Castrol India Ltd., (defendant No. 2) and the provision contained in Section 104 of the Patents Act, deserves to be transferred to the Delhi High Court, as number of matters involving the question relating to the revocation of Patent No. 172049 are pending in the Delhi High Court. We, therefore, transfer the aforesaid suit from Punjab and Haryana High Court to Delhi High Court. It appears that those matters are pending in the Delhi High Court since 1994. As all these matters are in respect of infringement of patent, rights, they deserve to be heard on priority basis.
2. We, therefore, request the Delhi High Court to dispose of all those matters and the matter which is directed by us today to be transferred to the Delhi High Court as expeditiously as possible on priority basis.
3.  The interim order passed by this Court will continue till any other order is passed by the Delhi High Court. The transfer petitions are disposed of accordingly.
Petitions disposed of.
