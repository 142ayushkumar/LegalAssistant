Prasad Nagar Residents Organisation v Vice Chairman, DDA
Supreme Court of India

1 August 2000
C.A. No. 2645 of 1991
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal has been preferred by the Prasad Nagar Residents' Organisation, C-8, Prasad Nagar, New Delhi against the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission dated 19th December, 1990 in Revision Petition No. 59 of 1990. The National Commission dismissed the revision as time barred.
2.  In this appeal notice was issued on 19.7.1996 and there was some objections raised by the Registry in respect of which an office note was put up. The case of the appellants' organisation was being represented by its President Mr. Sachidanand Hassija. This Court directed a fresh notice to be issued to him on 20.7.1999. It appears the said Mr. Hassija had sent a letter dated 24.8.1999 and, therefore, the matter was adjourned by this Court on 23.9.1999 and a fresh notice was directed to be issued to the appellant. On 14.12.1999 when the matter was called none was present for the appellant. The matter came up again on 5.4.2000 when fresh notice was issued to the appellant informing him that the matter will be taken up on the adjourned date.
3.  Now we have on record a letter dated 18.7.2000 addressed by the said Mr. Hassija to the Assistant Registrar of this Court stating that he is now 74 years old and has not been keeping good health. He says he is stone-deaf and having poor vision and tottering legs and cannot stand and is mostly in bed. He has spoken to his colleagues and other residents but none has shown any interest in the matter. He says he is unable to engage any Lawyer.
4. He has, therefore, stated that the case may be allowed to take its own natural course as he is unable to pursue the matter for reasons beyond his control. He has also stated that he had been informed that it is not possible to grant legal aid to him in this case.
5.  In view of the aforesaid fact, the appeal is dismissed for non-prosecution. Appeal dismissed for non-prosecution.
