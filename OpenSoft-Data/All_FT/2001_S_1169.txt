T. Vasumathi v State of Tamil Nadu
Supreme Court of India

15 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20076/2000
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is unnecessary to interfere with the order made by the High Court in this proceeding inasmuch as the proceeding out of which the petitioner filed the Writ petition under Article 227 of the Constitution itself has not been disposed of. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 207 of the Cr.P.C. to make available to her the appropriate documents in the language understandable by her.
2. If that is the matter, there was no occasion for the High Court to make observations as set forth in its order. Notwithstanding the observations made by the High Court, it would be appropriate for the petitioner to pursue with the application filed by her under Section 207 of the Cr.P.C. and take it to its logical end.
The Special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
