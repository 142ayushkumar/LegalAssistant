Bal Govind Lohia v Narayan Prasad Lohia and others
Supreme Court of India

5  May  2006
C.A. No. 2477 of 2006 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 8954 of 2005)
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard.
Leave granted.
1.  The short issue on which this appeal will have to be allowed is as under.
2.  On an earlier occasion, when the matter had come before us, this Court in Civil Appeal No. 1382 of 2002 made an order on 28-1-2003. In that order, this Court noticed that the learned Single Judge had set aside the award on several grounds, which were not considered and decided by the Division Bench. When Civil Appeal No. 1382 of 2002 was heard by this Court, this Court noticed that the Division Bench had not expressed its views with regard to several findings made by the Single Judge on different grounds for setting aside the award. Cognizant of this fact, this Court remitted the matter to the Division Bench of the High Court with the following observations:
"9. Accordingly, we dispose of these appeals with the direction that the matters be remitted to the High Court for the Division Bench to consider the other grounds on which the learned Single Judge had set aside the award by its judgment and order dated 17-11-1998, which have not been considered by the Division Bench in its judgment and order dated 18-5-2000."
3.  In view of the aforesaid limited or restrictive order of remit, it was necessary for the Division Bench of the High Court to consider the correctness of other grounds on which the learned Single Judge had set aside the award by his judgment dated 17-11-1998. Unfortunately, in the impugned judgment before us, it appears that the direction made while remitting the matter has not been noticed by the Division Bench. A reading of the impugned judgment does not indicate the views of the High Court with regard to the "other grounds" on which the Single Judge had set aside the award. Thus, we are of the view that the High Court has not complied with the conditions of the remit. Consequently, on this short ground alone, the appellant is entitled to succeed.
4.  The impugned judgment of the Division Bench is set aside and APO No. 620 of 1999 is remitted to the High Court. The Division Bench shall now hear APO No. 620 of 1999 in the light of the observations made in Civil Appeal No. 1382 of 2002 by the order dated 28-1-2003 and dispose it of in accordance with law.
5.  It shall be open to all the parties, who are entitled to be heard, to raise all contentions which are open to them in law. The appeal is, accordingly, allowed. There will be no order as to costs.
6.  Since the matter is said to be more than a decade old, it is preferable that the High Court disposes of the matter as expeditiously as possible.
7.  The parties shall appear before the Division Bench hearing such appeals, on 19-6-2006 and take further directions from the Court. In view of this direction, no separate notice need be issued by the High Court to the parties.
Appeal allowed.
