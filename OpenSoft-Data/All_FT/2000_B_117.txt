1.  525 days' delay in filing the Review Petition is not satisfactorily explained by the petitioner-Road Transport Corporation. Whether the Corporation has money or not to pay salaries to regular employees is totally irrelevant for explaining the delay. Similarly, rehabilitation package of the Corporation which is approved by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 7290 of 1994 also cannot be of any avail for obvious reasons.
2.   Firstly, the order dated January 21, 1998, which is relied upon is an interim order of this Court inter-parties where the petitioner was not in the picture.
3.   Secondly, even assuming that this order could have been relied upon by the petitioner as it was rendered on January 21, 1998 when the special leave petition was argued on July 14, 1998 no attempt was made to point out or to rely upon the said order. Consequently, even on merits the review petition is liable to fail and is, therefore, dismissed both on the ground of not satisfactorily explained delay as well as on merits.
Petition dismissed.
