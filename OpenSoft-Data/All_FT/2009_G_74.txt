Girish Chandra Aggarwal v Ramesh Prasad
Supreme Court of India

14  May  2009
CIVIL APPEAL NO.3556 OF 2009
(Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No.9581 of 2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  By the impugned order, the National Consumer Disputes Redressed Commission [for short, "National Commission"] has dismissed the revision application against the order passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressed Commission [for short, "State Commission"] whereby the State Commission refused to condone the delay in filing the appeal.
2.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records, we are of the view that the State Commission was not justified in refusing to condone the delay.
3. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned orders are set aside and delay in filing the appeal before the State Commission is condoned. Now, the State Commission shall decide the appeal on merits in accordance with law after giving opportunity of hearing to the parties.
Appeal allowed
