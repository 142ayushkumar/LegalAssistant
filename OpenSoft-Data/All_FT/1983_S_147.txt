State of Gujarat v V.A. Chauhan
Supreme Court of India

3 February 1983
Cr.A. No. 163 of 1976
The Judgment was delivered by :
1.  In this case the only point involved is as to whether the provisions of Probation of Offenders Act would apply to the present case where the respondent was convicted under Ss. 409, 467 and 471, I. P. C. and S. 5 (1) (c) read with S. 5 (2) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.
2.  The High Court gave the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act to the accused and since last six years the respondent is enjoying this benefit. The matter seems to be concluded by the decision of this Court reported in 1972 Indlaw SC 702 where it has been held that the benefit of Probation of Offenders Act cannot be given to an accused convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for life.
3. We entirely agree with this decision and hold that the Probation of Offenders Act is not applicable, but in the instant case, as the respondent has already been given the benefit of Probation of Offenders Act, we do not think it is in the interest of justice to interfere with it at this stage, after so many years. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
