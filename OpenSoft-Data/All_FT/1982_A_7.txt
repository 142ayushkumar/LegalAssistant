Mohammad Arif v Allah Rabbul Alamin and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 February 1982
C.A. No. 567 of 1982.
The orders of the court was as follows:
Special leave petition granted.
After hearing counsel on either side we are satisfied that the High Court's order stating that the appeal had abated and the appellant Mohammad Arif could not be brought on record as a legal representative of Mohammad Ahmed is clearly wrong.
1. It is true that the appellant did not prefer any appeal to the District Court against the original decree but in the first appeal he was a party respondent. But that apart, in the second appeal itself Mohammad Arif had joined as co-appellant along with his vendor, Mohammad Ahmed.
2. On the death of Mohammad Ahmed all that was required to be done was that the appellant who was on record should have been shown as a legal representative inasmuch as he was the transferee of the property in question and at least as an intermeddler was entitled to be treated as legal representative of Mohammad Ahmed. He being on record the estate of the deceased appellant qua the property in question was represented and there was no necessity for application for bringing the legal representatives of the deceased appellant on record.
3. The appeal in the circumstances could not be regarded as having abated and Mohammad Arif was entitled to prosecute the appeal. We, therefore, set aide the order of the High Court and send the appeal back to the High Court for disposal according to law.
This disposes of the appeal with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
