Commissioner of Income Tax v Swaran Singh Kanwar
Supreme Court of India

26 February 1997
C.A. No. 5753 of 1983
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal, by special leave, has been filed by the Revenue against the judgment of the Delhi High Court, dt. 25th July, 1980, in ITC No. 23 of 1980, whereby the High Court has dismissed the application filed by the Revenue under s. 256(2) of the IT Act, 1961, (hereinafter referred to as "the Act")
2.  The facts are in a narrow compass and may be stated as under:
3.   The assessee had made investments in shares in industrial as well as non-industrial companies and for that purpose he had borrowed funds. In the asst. yr. 1972-73, the assessee had received Rs.62,160 as dividends on the said shares in the industrial as well as non- industrial companies. He had paid a sum of Rs.55,197 as interest on the company borrowed for making investment in the shares. The amount received as dividend included Rs.18,516 received as dividend on the shares in Bharat Steel Tubes Ltd., an industrial company. In view of s. 80K of the Actdividend on shares in an industrial company has to be deducted from the gross total income as defined in cl. (5) of s. 80B of the Act. The ITO disallowed the deduction to the extent of Rs.51,612 out of the interest amount of Rs.55,197 paid by the assessee but he permitted deduction of Rs.18,516 under s. 80K. The said order of the ITO was upheld in appeal by the AAC but, on further appeal, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as "the T
"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, The Tribunal was right in allowing the claim of interest amounting to Rs.51,612 paid on borrowed capital by the assessee for the purpose of shares when the dividend income therefrom was exempted under s. 80K of the IT Act ?"
4.  By the impugned judgment the High Court has held that in view of s. 57(iii) the amount of interest paid on borrowed capital used for earning income had to be allowed as deduction and the question sought to be referred was only academic in nature. The application filed by the Revenue was, therefore, dismissed
5.  While we are in agreement with the order of the High Court rejecting the application under s. 256(2) of the IT Act, we find that the approach of the High Court has been influenced by the decision of this Court in Cloth Traders (P) Ltd. vs. Addl. CIT 1979 Indlaw SC 2291979 Indlaw SC 229 which decision has subsequently been overruled by this Court in Distributors (Baroda) (P) Ltd. vs. Union of India 1985 Indlaw SC 4051985 Indlaw SC 405. In the circumstances it is necessary to clarify the position in this regard
6.  Sec. 80K, since deleted by the Finance Act, 1986, fell in Chapter VI-A bearing the heading "Deductions in respect of certain incomes". It made provision for deduction in respect of dividends attributable to profits and gains from new industrial undertakings or ships or hotel business. Such deduction was to be made from the gross total income. The expression "gross total income" is defined in cl. (5) of s. 80B to mean the total income computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act, before making any deduction under Chapter VI-A.
7.   This means that before applying s. 80K it is necessary to determine the income in accordance with the other provisions of the Act, including s. 56 r/w s. 57(iii) of the IT Act, and only thereafter the deduction under s. 80K has to be made. On that view of the matter, the interest amount of Rs.55,197 paid on the borrowings for the investment in shares had first to be deducted out of the dividend income of Rs.62,160 and the balance amount would have been the income of dividend.
No order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
