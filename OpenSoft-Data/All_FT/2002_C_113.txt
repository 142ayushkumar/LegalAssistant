Supreme Court of India

24 October 2002
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 6936 OF 200 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.20275 of 2000) with CIVIL APPEAL NOS.6937 and 6935 OF 2002 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) Nos.20276/2000 and 20277/2000) and CIVIL APPEAL NO. 6938 OF 2002 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C)No.847/2002) S.L.P.(C) Nos.20275, 20276 and 20277 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave is granted.
2. The Revenue is in appeal against the order of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur in Writ Petition Nos.3025, 3026 and 3027 of 1998, dated 2nd June, 2000. These appeals relate to Assessment Years 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92.
3. The respondent-assessee is a manufacturer/dealer in Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and beer etc. It packs the liquor in bottles and sells to various customers. Relying on the first proviso to S. 2(s) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954 (for short, 'the S.T.Act'), the assessing authority assessed sales tax on the basis of one per cent postulated therein being the measure for working out the taxable turnover of packing material. The orders of assessment were questioned before the Deputy Commissioner (Appeals) by the respondent-assessee, but they were upheld. The assessee then preferred second appeals before the Rajasthan Tax Board.
The appeals having been allowed, the Revenue filed Sales Tax Revisions before the Rajasthan Taxation Tribunal, Bench at Jodhpur. The Tribunal, by its order dated July 27, 1998, set aside the order of the Board. That order was impugned in writ petitions before the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur. A Division Bench of the High Court took the view that reliance on S. 2(s) was misplaced and that there was nothing on record to show that there had been sale of the packing material, whether express or implied. In that view of the matter, the writ petitions, in relation to Assessment Years 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92, were allowed by the common impugned judgment. That is how, three appeals came to be filed by the Revenue.
4. Heard Mr.Sushil Kumar Jain, learned counsel for the appellant, and Mr.Sunil Kumar Gupta, learned counsel for the respondent-assessee.
5. Inasmuch as the basis of the orders of assessment is the proviso to S. 2(s) of the S.T.Act, it would be appropriate to read the said section insofar as it is relevant for our purposes.
"2(s) "taxable turnover" means that part of turnover which remains after deducting therefrom the aggregate amount of the proceeds of sale of goods---
(i) on which no tax is leviable under this Act,
(ii) which have already been subjected to tax under this Act,
(iii) which have been sold to persons outside the State of consumption outside the State, and
(iv) which are taxable at a point of sale within the State subsequent to the sale by the dealer and such sale is covered by a declaration as may be required under any provision of this Act or the rules made there under.
Provided that where a dealer in goods which are exempted from tax unconditionally, sells any bardana, container or any other packing material received along with such goods at the time of purchase thereof by him, the taxable turnover in respect of such sales shall, at the option of such dealer to be exercised in the prescribed manner, be one per cent of the aggregate amount of the sale prices received or receivable by him in respect of the sale or supply of such goods and of such bardana, container or material.
xxx xxx xxx xxx"
6. From a plain reading of the proviso, quoted above, it is evident that it is attracted to a situation where a dealer in exempted goods sells any bardana, container or any other packing material received along with such goods at the time of purchase thereof by him; in such a case, the taxable turnover in respect of such sales of bardana, container or other packing material shall, at the option of such dealer to be exercised in the prescribed manner, be one per cent of the aggregate amount of the sale prices received or receivable by him in respect of sale or supply of such goods, namely the IMFL and bardana etc. It may be pointed out that the seller of such bardana, container or other packing material ought to have received the same when he purchased the goods along with them. That could happen not in the first sale of such goods but in the subsequent sales. While interpreting the said proviso, we have held in Civil Appeal No.6885/2000, decided on October 23, 2002, that it is not attracted to the first sale of the goods. That being the position, the very foundation of the assessment would be non-existent, therefore, the order of assessment is unsustainable. It was unnecessary for the authorities to go into other questions which are left open.
7. In this view of the matter, we do not find any reason to interfere with the order under challenge. The appeals are, therefore, dismissed with costs.
S.L.P.(C) No.847/2002
8. Delay is condoned.
9. Leave is granted.
10. In view of the dismissal of Civil Appeal No.6936/2002 (arising out of S.L.P.(C) No.20275/2000) and connected matters today, this appeal is also dismissed as the same question of law is involved in this case.
