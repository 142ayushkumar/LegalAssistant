J v State of Maharashtra and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 October 1986
S.L.P. (Criminal) Nos. 2829-30 of 1986 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 1 October 3, 4, 1986 of the High Court of Bombay in Cr. Appln. No. 1536 and Cr. Revision No. 360 of 1986), with S.L.P. (Criminal) Nos. 2827-28 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The special leave petitions are allowed to be withdrawn since the petitioners would be making a fresh application for bail to the High Court, in view of the fact that the High Court proceeded on an erroneous basis that the order granting or refusing bail must be a speaking order. The petitioners are given time to surrender by 4 p. m. on October 24, 1986 unless in the mean while, the High Court in the exercise of its discretion, thinks it fit to grant bail or extend the time for surrender.
Petitions allowed.
