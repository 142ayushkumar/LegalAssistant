U.P. Power Corporation Limited v Yogender Kumar
Supreme Court of India

10 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14637/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This special leave petition is filed against the order passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad on 25.5.2001. The order itself records that the writ petition would come up for hearing in the week commencing 17th September, 2001. We are at a loss as to why instead of proceeding with the matter before the High Court, the petitioner moved this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. We are not inclined to entertain this petition.
2. The petitioner, however, would be at liberty to take appropriate steps before the High Court. The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
