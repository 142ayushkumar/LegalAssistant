K. E. Thankamani v State of Kerala
Supreme Court of India

6 April 1998
Cr.A. No. 414 of 1998 (arising out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 921 of 1998), Dt. 6 April 1998.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  The appellant has been convicted for the offence under section 302, IPC for having committed the murder of her two children by throwing them in well.
2.  The case of the prosecution is that the appellant herself jumped in the well and subsequently she survived. The learned counsel for the appellant has invited our attention to Rule 131 of the Criminal Rules of Practice, Kerala, 1982 which reads as follows :
"Reference to Government in case of infanticide : In all cases where women are convicted for the murder of their infant children, a reference shall be made through the High Court to the Government with an expression by the Sessions Judge of his opinion as to the propriety or otherwise of reducing the sentence, every such reference shall be accompanied by copies of the material papers of the record."
3.  It appears that the said Rule was not notice by the Sessions Judge or by the High Court. Having regard to the provision contained in the aforesaid Rule, we dispose of the appeal with the recommendation to the Government to consider the matter of remission of sentence of the appellant keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case.
Appeal disposed of.
