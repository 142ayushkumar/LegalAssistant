Jigneshkumar Sureshbhai Patel v State of Gujarat
Supreme Court of India

6 January 2005
Cr.A. No. 21 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr. ) No. 5074 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant was charged under Section 66(1)(b) and Section 85(1)(a) of the Bombay Prohibition Act on the ground of having consumed liquor and behaving indecently in a public place. He was acquitted of the charge under Section 85(1)(3).
2. However, the appellant having been found guilty under Section 66(1)(b) was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of Rs 500. The only point which deserves consideration is in regard to the quantum of sentence. The finding is that the sample blood collected from the appellant contained 0.0802% of alcohol which was exceeding the limit of 0.05% prescribed by the Bombay Prohibition (Medical Examination and Blood Test) (Gujarat Amendment) Rules, 1985.
3.  The charge of disorderly behaviour in a public place failed. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to reduce the sentence of imprisonment to 15 days and increase the quantum of fine from Rs 500 to Rs 1000 and we order accordingly. The appeal is thus disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
