Roshni Devi v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.2793/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We do not wish to go into the question of law raised for the following reasons:
2. When this special leave petition was filed learned Attorney General Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee wished that instead of this matter being contested he would persuade the Government to pass some order in the interest of equity. It is admitted now that at the intervention of the learned Attorney General Government passed an order granting Rs.56,000/- as a lump-sum amount to be paid to the petitioner. She is reported to be running in her seventies.
3.  Today, Mr. Harish N. Salve, learned Solicitor General submitted that in addition to the above lump-sum payment, the petitioner would be paid a sum of Rs.1275/- per month which is being paid to her regularly w.e.f. 1.9.2000 and if there is any revision made hereafter this figure is likely to vary. This is recorded.
4.  In the light of the above submission, we do not think it necessary to consider the point of law raised by learned counsel for the petitioner. This is accordingly closed. The special leave petition accordingly stands dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
