Yashvir Singh v Messrs Modern Food Industry (India) Limited and Another
Supreme Court of India

13 January 1992
S.L.P. (C) No. 11724/1991,
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard counsel in both sides and with their consent we proceed to dispose of the matter at the notice stage itself. Mr. Ramamurthi contended that having regard to the fact that the respondent No. 1, who was a witness since it was his case which, it is alleged, the petitioner had stopped and it was with him that he had misbehaved, he ought not to have issued the chargesheet and at any rate he ought not to have passed the impugned order because to do so would be to appreciate the worth of his own evidence.
2.  He further stated that merely because the appellate authority had confirmed the order would not remove the taint which attaches to the order of termination. The order of termination is thus attacked on the ground of violation of the rule of natural justice.
3.  The other side would say that since under the standing orders it was respondent No. 1, who was charged with the duty to pass the impugned order, he did so out of necessity and, therefore, the order is not liable to be challenged. After hearing these rival contentions, we thought if proper to put an end to matter by direction payment of adequate compensation to the workman but not granting him reinstatement with backwages.
4.  We therefore, do not interfere with the order on condition that Rs.75,000/- will be paid by way of compensation to the petitioner within a period of one month. 
The compensation amount may be paid to the petitioner directly. The petitioner will approach the Company on receipt of the latter from the Company in that behalf. The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
