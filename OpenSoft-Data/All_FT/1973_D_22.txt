CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 1279 of 1970. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 21, 1969 of the Delhi High Court at New Delhi, in L.P.A. No. 101-D/66
The Judgment was delivered by : A. N. Ray, J.
1. This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment dated 21 November, 1969 of the Delhi High Court dismissing the writ petition of the appellants. The appellants made an application u/art. 226 of the  Constitution in the Delhi High Court. The appellants asked for quashing two orders dated 29 April, 1964 and 1 February, 1965, On 29 April, 1964 the Deputy Custodian General issued a notice to the appellant Fatima Bi to show cause why the order dated 11 January, 1956 should not be revised as the same was obtained by fraud and was illegal. The appellant Fatima Bi made an application for cancelling the notice requiring her to show cause.. On 1 February, 1965 the Deputy Custodian General passed an order rejecting the objections of the appellant Fatima Bi. By the said order dated 1 February, 1965 the authorised Deputy Custodian was asked to expedite recording' of evidence and submission of report.
2. The appellant Fatima Bi is the wife of the appellant Mohd. Sayeed. The appellant Fatima Bi's case is that she, is the owner of certain property at Delhi. By an ex-parte order dated 25 November, 1953 the Assistant Custodian declared her as evacuee and her property to be evacuee property. she filed an appeal against the ex-parte order. The ex-parte order was set aside. The Assistant Custodian was required to decide on merits the appellant. Fatima Bi's case. By an order dated 1 1 January, 1956 the Assistant Custodian held that the appellant Fatima Bi was a non,evacuee owner of the property. On 29 April, 1964 a notice under 's. 27 of the Administration of evacuee Property Act, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) was issued to show cause why the order dated 11 January, 1956 should not be revised. The 'grounds for the notice were that the appellant Fatima Bi had left for Pakistan in 1947, and it was fraudulently averred that she was a non-evacuee and was residing at Calcutta with the appellant Mohd. Sayeed. The other ground alleged in the notice was that in order to establish the appellant Fatima Bi's non-evacuee status as well as to secure the release of the property forged documents and perjured evidence was tendered before the Assistant Custodian.
3. The appellants raised three contentions in the High Court. First, that the order dated 11 January, 1956 had become final and could not be re-opened, by virtue of s. 28 of the Act. Second, fresh proceedings were barred under s. 7-A of the Act. Third, the proceedings under s. 27 of the Act were barred by limitation. The High Court held that the order dated 11 January, 1956 was not final and it could be re-opened. s. 28 of the Act was held by the High Court not to be a bar to the powers of revision under s. 27 of. the Act. s. 28 makes orders final save as otherwise expressly provided in Chapter V. s.s 27 and 28 both occur in Chapter V. Therefore, the High Court rightly held that the power of revision under s. 27 was not taken away by s. 28 of the Act.
4. The High Court also held that s. 7-A of the Act did not constitute a bar to the issue of notice under s. 27. The bar in s. 7-A is that no property shall be declared to be evacuee property on or after 7 May, 1954. The proviso to s. 7-A is that nothing contained in the s. shall apply to any property, in respect of which proceedings are pending on 7 May, 1954. When the ex-parte order dated 25 November, 1953 was set aside the High Court held that the proceedings in respect of the property were pending on 7 May, 1954 and that is how an order was passed on 11 January 1956 in favour of the appellant Fatima Bi. The High Court also held that the notice under s. 27 of the Act was issued several years after 11 January, 1956 order had been passed but the power under s. 27 of the Act was not curtailed by any limitation of time. Counsel on behalf of the appellants repeated the contentions 'which had been advanced in the High Court. The High Court rightly rejected the appellants' contentions.
5. An additional contention was advanced, viz., that the order. dated 29 April, 1964 was not passed by the Custodian General. The Custodian General is defined in s. 2(b) of the Act to mean the Custodian General of Evacuee Property in India appointed by the Central Government u/s. 5 of the Act. S. 2(c) defines 'Custodian' to mean the Custodian for' the,. State and includes any Additional, Deputy or Assistant Custodian-, of evacuee property appointed in that State. S. 6(2) of the,. Act states that subject to the provisions of the Act all Custodians, Additional, Deputy and Assistant Custodian of evacuee property. shall discharge the duties imposed on them by or under this Act under the general superintendence and control of the Custodian., General. 'The order-dated 29 April, 1964 was validly made for-Custodian General.
6. The petition of the appellants was utterly misconceived. The. relevant authorities have power to call for the record of any proceeding in which any Custodian has passed an order for the purpose of satisfying as to the legality or propriety of such order. In, the present case the order has been questioned by the authorities on the ground that the appellant Fatima Bi obtained the order. Fraudulently. Fraud is a question of fact. It is open to the appellant Fatima Bi to establish that she obtained the order properly. Certicrari will not lie for the obvious reason that the, authorities have jurisdiction to issue the notice. There is neither. excess of jurisdiction 'nor usurpation.' It was said on behalf of the appellants that the order of 1956 was called in question in 1964. Several years have passed. The,. Relevant authorities will take steps to expedite the hearing in the. Matter. For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. Each party will pay and bear their own costs.
