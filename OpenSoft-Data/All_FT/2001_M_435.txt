Mohan Popatbhai(Dead) By Lrs. and Others v State of Gujarat and Anr
Supreme Court of India

12 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19256-19326/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  SLP(C)7854-7882/2000 Mr. SK Dholakia, learned senior counsel submitted that as the State has already moved the High Court for correction of that part of the judgment, these SLPs may be allowed to be withdrawn without prejudice to the right of the State to pursue the matter. Accordingly these SLPs are dismissed as withdrawn.
2.  SLP(C) Nos.19256-19326/99 and 4492-4686/2000 We are not inclined to consider the question of further enhancement or of the market value of the land though learned counsel contended that even when preferring a cross-objection or an appeal the court has jurisdiction to grant the same. The remaining question raised is that the petitioner is entitled to interest of solatium. Since the question is now pending before a larger bench of this Court in the interest of justice the same course can be adopted in this case also.
3. Learned counsel submits that the said course has been reported in .
These SLPs are disposed of in terms of the said order.
Petitions disposed of.
