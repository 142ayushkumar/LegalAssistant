State of Rajasthan and Anr v Surendra Pratap Gaur
Supreme Court of India

12 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13422/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  One of the question which arises for consideration is whether the respondent was employed in an industry. According to the appellants, the establishment where the respondent was employed is not an industry and he was employed in what is known as Rang Manch which merely exhibits documentary films, etc., showing the achievements of the Government. This aspect has not been dealt with either by the Single Judge or the Division Bench notwithstanding the fact that the contention to this effect was specifically raised before the Single Judge.
2.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the order of the Single Judge and that of the Division Bench and direct the High Court to decide Civil Writ Petition No. 5304 of 1999 afresh and to decide whether the respondent was employed in an industry or not. It will be open to the parties to raise such contentions as may be available to them in accordance with law, before the High Court.
Appeal allowed.
