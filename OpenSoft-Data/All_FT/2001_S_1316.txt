Paresh Sarkar v State of West Bengal
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1350/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  By the order passed on 3.4.2001 the special leave petition stood dismissed so far as petitioner No.1 - Tarit Kundu is concerned.
2.  This special leave petition is pressed on behalf of the petitioner No.2-Parvesh Sarkar. Learned counsel for the petitioner No.2 submits that the role ascribed to Parvesh Sarkar is similar to the co-accused Sukumar Ghosh who has been released on bail by order of the High Court.
3.  This position is fairly accepted by learned counsel for the respondent-State of West Bengal. In view of the agreed position we do not find any good reason why the prayer for bail by petitioner No.2 should be rejected. Accordingly it is ordered that petitioner No.2 - Parvesh Sarkar shall be released on bail on execution of a bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties for the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. Accordingly the SLP is disposed of so far as petitioner No.2 is concerned.
Petition disposed of.
