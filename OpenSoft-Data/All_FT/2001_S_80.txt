Sahebrao Gangadhar Kadam v Vishwanath Shivram Jadhav and Anr
Supreme Court of India

9 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18715/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We do not find it a fit case for interference. The special leave petition is dismissed.
2.  It was then urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the time for deposit of money by the court below has since expired and, therefore, time may be extended. We feel that the request is reasonable. We, therefore, extend the time by four weeks to deposit the money.
3. In case the respondents have any objection to this part of the order, it would be open to him to move for recall of the same.
Petition dismissed.
