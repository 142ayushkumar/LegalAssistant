Bhagwanti and Others v Subordinate Services Selection Board, Haryana and Another
Supreme Court of India

22 November 1993
C.A. No. ... of 1993 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 16095 of 1993)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The Subordinate Services Selection Board, Haryana selected 48 candidates for appointment as Lady Social Workers. Out of the selected candidates 26 were offered appointments. The selection and the appointments were challenged before the High Court on the ground that the Selection Committees interviewed large number of conduits in a short span of time and as such the selection was a sham affair. The specific allegation was that as many as 687 candidates were interviewed by two Selection Committees on one and the same day.
2.  It is obvious from the impugned order of the High Court that in the writ petition before it only the Subordinate Services Selection Board was impleaded as a party. Neither the selected candidates nor those who were issued appointment letters were impleaded as parties before the High Court.
3. The High Court set aside the selection and the appointments without hearing the persons concerned. It is settled proposition of law that no order to the detriment of a person can be passed without hearing him. We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the impugned order of the High Court on this short ground.
4.  The writ petition filed by the respondents before the High Court is thus dismissed. No costs.
Petition dismissed.
