Arun Ram Chandra Swant v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

30 March 1987
Cr.A. No. 568 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  In spite of the fact that on several earlier occasions this Court had pointed out that the High Court should not dismiss a criminal appeal in limine without a speaking order, we are sorry to note that this has happened again. When a person is convicted of a grave offence such as murder and the statute provides him with a right of appeal, surely he is entitled to have the case considered by the appellate court on merits. We do not think that the right of appeal should be reduced to nothing by dismissing the appeal in limine without even a speaking order.
2.   The order of the High Court is, therefore, set aside. The High Court will admit the appeal and dispose it of in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
