Vijay Pal Sharma and Others v Delhi Administration and Others
Supreme Court of India

12 March 1990
I.A. No. 2 In W.P. No. 818 of
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Having considered the facts we are of the opinion that this matter is covered by the decision of the court entitled Niadar and Another v. Delhi Administration and Another 1988 Indlaw SC 244 which was decided on September 29, 1988.
2. In terms thereof thus, we direct the Delhi Administration to absorb the petitioners in accordance with the prepared scheme for absorbing casual labourers, which scheme has been made effective from October 1, 1988. In terms of the scheme, any casual labourer who has worked for one year or more in the Horticulture Department shall be regularised within a period of six months from today if such casual labourer is otherwise fit to be regularised under the scheme as regular employee. On that footing each casual labourer working in the department shall get salary or wages at the rate equivalent to the minimum salary paid to be regular employee in comparable posts in the Horticulture Department.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioners has also contended that the expression salary or wages' used in Niadar case 1988 Indlaw SC 244 and which has been used instantly also has given rise to a doubt in the department as to whether on regularisation minimum wage is to be paid or minimum salary to the regular employee, and on that about Rs. 750 per month instead of Rs. 1100 per month has been paid to some of the employees.
4. Learned counsel for the Delhi Administration disputes this fact and says that it was always meant and always shall mean that minimum salary plus allowances which comes to about Rs. 1100 has been paid to such employees and is otherwise payable. This clarifies the doubt expressed. The writ petition is accordingly disposed of in these terms. No costs.
Petition disposed of.
