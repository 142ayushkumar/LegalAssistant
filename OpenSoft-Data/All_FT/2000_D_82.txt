State of Punjab and Others v Devinder Kumar and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4740-4743/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In view of the assertion in the counter affidavits that the impugned judgment has already been implemented and that there has been an inordinate delay of 469 days in filing the Special Leave Petition (No.4740-43/99), and no sufficient cause for the same has been shown, we are not inclined to condone the delay particularly when the impugned judgment has already been implemented.
2.  Even on merits, we do not find a case for our interference in these matters.
All the Special Leave Petitions stand dismissed accordingly.
Petitions dismissed.
