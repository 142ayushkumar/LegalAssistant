Gopal Krushna Goshala v Orissa Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation and others
Supreme Court of India

10 February 2016
Civil Appeal Nos. 9690-9691 of 2010
(Non-Reportable)
The Judgment was delivered by : Anil R. Dave, J.
1. Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
2. Upon perusal of the impugned judgment and the evidence which had been considered by the High Court, we are of the view that the High Court ought not to have reduced the amount of compensation for the homestead land from Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakhs) to Rs.2,50,000/- (Rupees two lakhs fifty thousand) per acre, especially in view of the sale deeds which had been executed on 21st November, 1979 and had been placed on record by the owners of the land.
3. Upon considering the facts of the case, we feel that Rs.4,00,000/- (Rupees four lakhs) per acre is the fair amount of compensation for the homestead land. Therefore, we modify the impugned judgment accordingly. Needless to say that on the said amount all statutory benefits, including interest, shall be paid.
4. The civil appeals are accordingly disposed of with no order as to costs. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of.
