The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. By order dated 28.10.2009, while issuing notice on I.A. No. 46 of 2009, we had granted the status quo in regard to shifting of the live stock market of buffalo from Idgah to Gazipur. Thereby, that market was not shifted to Gazipur.
2. The order of status quo was extended on 4.11.2009 till today. Considering the overall facts, it is not possible to continue the status quo as we are of the opinion that the buffalo market now cannot be allowed to continue at Idgah. However, at the request of Mr. V.A. Mohta, learned senior counsel appearing for the applicant in I.A. No. 2 in I.A. No. 42, in view of the festival of Bakrid, we extend the interim order of status quo dated 4.11.2009 till 1.12.2009. The live stock market of buffalo shall shift thereafter to Gazipur.
3. Mr. V.A. Mohta, learned senior counsel as well as other learned counsel appearing in different I.As. represented before us that their complaints have not been taken care of and that they have some useful suggestions to be made in respect of the market and other facilities in and around the Gazipur abattoir.
4. We permit them to make representations to the Delhi Government, Municipal Corporation of Delhi and Delhi Pollution Control Board airing their grievances and making their suggestions. These representations shall be made within two weeks from today. After the receipt of the representations, concerned authorities shall actively consider the same with a positive mind in order to allay the grievances as far as possible. This shall be done within six weeks from the date of receipt of the representations.
5. Put up these I.As. on 3.2.2010 at 3 P.M.
Order accordingly
