Harish Kumar Yadav v Registrar, H.C Of Judicature At Allahabad
Supreme Court of India

19 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17629/1999
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties.At the stage of issuance of notice, this Court had indicated that this appeal will be disposed of at the SLP stage itself.
2.  We notice from the judgment of the High Court that the writ petition had raised 7 grounds but the High Court proceeded to dispose of the writ petition without considering the merits involved in those grounds and without assigning any reason of its own except to say that all the 7 grounds were considered by the Administrative Committee of the High Court and it is thereafter that the said Committee had upheld the adverse remarks against the petitioner.
3.  In our opinion, this reasoning of the High Court is fallacious, hence, unsustainable because what was challenged in the writ petition is the findings of the Committee of the High Court in the Administrative Side which the writ petitioner was entitled to do. He has assailed the said findings of the Administrative Committee on certain grounds raised in the writ petition, hence, it was just and necessary for the High Court to have addressed itself to these grounds and to have decided the same by a reasoned order. That having not been done, this appeal is liable to be allowed, the impugned order is set aside and the matter stands remitted to the High Court for disposal in accordance with law.
Appeal allowed.
