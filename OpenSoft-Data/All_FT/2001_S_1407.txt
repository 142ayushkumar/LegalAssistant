Surender Nandkishore Agarwal v State of Gujarat and Anr
Supreme Court of India

8 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3611/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In view of the decision of this Court in Bipin Shantilal Panchal vs. State of Gujarat and Another, we are not inclined to interfere. But Mr. Sushil Kumar, learned senior counsel submits that unlike the course adopted in the said decision the trial court has already passed his orders regarding the objections raised on the admissibility of the documents objected. Such orders will be only provisional and the right of any party for canvassing for a different decision on such objections when the matter is dealt with at the final stage would remain unaffected.
2.  Mr. Sushil Kumar, learned senior counsel then expressed apprehension whether any answers given by the accused on those documents when they are put to him under Section 313 of the Cr. P.C. could be used by the court.
3. It is unnecessary for us to point out that if the documents are ultimately found by the court as inadmissible by upholding the objections, any answers of the accused relating to those documents will have no use.
With these observations this Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
