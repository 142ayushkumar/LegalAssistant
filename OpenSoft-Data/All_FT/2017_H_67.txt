1. Despite service of notice, none has appeared for the respondents.
2. Leave granted.
3. The appellant is before this Court, aggrieved by the short judgment of the High Court dated 4.7.2017, which reads as under:-
"1. Called in revised. None appeared to press this writ petition. In the circumstances, we ourselves have perused the record.
2. By means of present writ petition, petitioner has sought following reliefs:
"(a). Issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of certiorari quashing the termination order dated 2.8.2000 passed by the respondent No.2 (Annexure '9' to the writ petition);
(b) issue a writ, order of direction in the nature of mandamus commanding the respondents to reinstate the petitioner in his service with full salary and arrears."
3. Having gone through the entire writ petition, we do not find any ground entitling petitioner for grant of any of above reliefs. No interference, therefore, is called.
4. Dismissed.
5. Interim order, if any, stands vacated."
4. We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and also gone through the records as produced by the appellant. Admittedly, there is no other alternative remedy available to the appellant for challenging the termination.
5. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered view that the High Court should have given an opportunity of hearing to the appellant and considered the matter on the submissions made by the appellant. We, hence, set aside the impugned judgment and, accordingly, the writ petition is restored. We request the High Court to dispose of the writ petition, after hearing the appellant herein.
6. The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of.
7. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
8. There shall be no orders as to costs.
Appeal disposed of
