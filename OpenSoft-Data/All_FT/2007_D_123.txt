In Re : Destruction of Public and Private Properties
Supreme Court of India

5 June 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It has come to our notice that in the last one week there has been large-scale destruction of public and private properties and no preventive action appears to have been taken and unfortunately it does not prima facie appear that any action has been taken against the offenders who were responsible for destruction of such properties. As the electronic media shows, the offenders feel that they have done some very heroic or laudable thing because they show their beaming faces when the TV camera is focused on them.
2.  At our request, Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, Senior Advocate, present in Court, has agreed to assist this Court as an amicus curiae. Dr. Dhavan may ask the TV channels concerned to provide the footage of the telecasts to the police authorities as also to him so that appropriate orders can be passed in the matter. Dr. Dhavan submitted that even if there may be a right to protest in some cases, that does not give licence to anybody to destroy properties and/or indulge in acts of vandalism.
3.  We direct the Director Generals of Police of the States of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh and the Commissioner of Police, Delhi to file affidavits in this Court as to what actions have been taken and/or are proposed to be taken against the offenders.
4. The affidavits shall also indicate if no action has been taken as yet, and the cause therefor. The affidavits shall be filed within 10 days from today.
The matter shall be listed on 18-6-2007.
Order accordingly.
