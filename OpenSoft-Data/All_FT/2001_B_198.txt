Bhuneshwar Pandey v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

9 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 968/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  As the trial has reached almost the fag end we do not want to direct the accused to be released on bail. But the tardy progress of the trial in the sessions court is very distressing. Sessions judge in his report says that the tardiness is on account of the non-cooperation of police officers and the investigating agency. That is no ground to allow the trial to go on endlessly. The trial is pending for more than three years, and the accused is in jail during all these period.
2.  As per the directions issued by this Court in Raj Deo Sharma vs. State of Bihar 1998 Indlaw SC 1131 and Raj Deo Sharma -II vs. State of Bihar 1999 Indlaw SC 741, we order the sessions court to close the prosecution evidence forthwith. He shall proceed to the next step as envisaged in the aforementioned decisions.
3. The whole case shall be disposed of within a period of one month from today, unless the accused demands defence evidence to be adduced in which case it is for the court to extend the period of one month further, only for such defence evidence.
4.  The SLP is disposed of in the above terms. This order shall be communicated to the trial court immediately.
Petition disposed of.
