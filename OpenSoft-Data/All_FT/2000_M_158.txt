Prakash and Another v Managing Director, K.S.R.T.C. and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 January 2000
Petition for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 18234 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. This is a case where the petitioners claimed Rs. 1,06,000 as compensation awardable to them in respect of a motor accident in which brother of the petitioners died. That amount was granted by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. Dissatisfied with the amount awarded, petitioners filed an appeal before the High Court but the High Court found that the appeal was barred by limitation and there was no explanation for an inordinate delay of 416 days. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed. It is against the said order that this SLP has been filed.
2. Learned counsel contended that petitioners are entitled to ask more amount than what they claimed in the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. That question of law is left open.
3. All the same, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order which found no adequate reason for condoning the delay of 416 days. The SLP is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed
