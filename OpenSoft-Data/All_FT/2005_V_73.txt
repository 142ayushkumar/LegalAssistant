Vivek Sarin v Multi Metal Udyog
Supreme Court of India

13 April 2005
C.A. No. 7110 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  It appears that while issuing notice in the special leave petition it was directed that the proceedings under the contempt of courts are stayed. The present appeal has been filed against the interim order passed in Civil Contempt Petition No. 3 of 1998, which is pending before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana.
2.  As the matter remained pending before this Court for six years and the contempt appeal is pending for the last seven years, we think it would be just and expedient that the said appeal pending before the High Court is disposed of with utmost expedition and till the disposal of the appeal, the aforesaid interim order passed by this Court should continue.
3. Accordingly, we request the High Court to dispose of the aforesaid contempt appeal with utmost expedition and till the disposal of the said appeal, the interim order passed by this Court shall continue.
The appeal is, accordingly, disposed of. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
