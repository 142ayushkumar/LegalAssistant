Dy. Commissioner of Police and Others v Mohd. Khaja Ali
Supreme Court of India

12 January 2000
C.A. No. 512 of 1992 (Along with C.A. Nos. 5114, 5115, 5116, 5117, 5118, 5119, 5142, 5120 of 1997, S.L.P. (C) Nos. 2224 of 1999, 12235 of 1989).
The order of the court was as follows :
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we do not think it is necessary to go into the various contentions raised in these appeals on behalf of the State of Andhra Pradesh, as we are of the opinion that since the decision in RP No. 933/1997 dated 30.1.1978, followed in subsequent decisions by the Tribunal, the provisions of City Police Act, 1348F are holding the field and are not in any manner superseded by the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1953, and A.P. Police Subordinate Service Rules in so far as they relate to dismissal of police constable by the Commissioner of Police Hyderabad City. By now more than 22 years have passed and the law laid down therein has been followed in the State of Andhra Pradesh for all these years. We are therefore not inclined to disturb the impugned order.
2.  In view of what is stated above all these appeals to stand disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.
Interim orders, if any, stand vacated.
Appeals disposed of
