Shyma and Others v M. Aravindan
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19229/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order of the High Court. The Special Leave Petition stands dismissed accordingly.
2. However Mr. Iyer appearing for the tenant-petitioners prays for some time to deliver the vacant possession of the premises in question. The learned counsel appearing for the landlord-opposite party vehemently opposes the same.
Having considered the submissions of both counsel, we direct that the tenant-petitioners shall deliver the vacant possession of the premises in question to the landlord-opposite party on or before 31st of May, 2001 subject to the usual undertaking being filed in this Court within four weeks from today.
Petition dismissed.
