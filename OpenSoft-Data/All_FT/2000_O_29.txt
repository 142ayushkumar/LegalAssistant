Oriental Insurance Company Limited v Dulal Gope and Anr
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17789/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The Insurance Company's present stand is that there was no policy of insurance in respect of the vehicle. But when the claimant asserted in his claim petition that the vehicle was insured with the petitioner-Company the owner of the vehicle in his written statement did not deny that averment. All that the petitioner-Company said in the written statement was that if there was any policy the same should be produced by the owner. He did not choose to produce it. No demand was made by the Insurance Company on -2- the owner during the pendency of the claim petition for production of the insurance policy. No interrogatory was served on him. Even in the High Court there was no prayer to serve an interrogatory on the insured.
2.  In the aforesaid circumstances it is too late in the day for the Insurance Company to raise the plea that there would not have been a policy of insurance at all.
We, therefore, dismiss this petition.
Petition dismissed.
