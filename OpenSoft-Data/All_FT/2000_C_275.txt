Supreme Court of India

11 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7475/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  By an interim order dated 4.1.2000 a learned single Judge in a writ petition directed the appellants herein to permit the respondent No.1 herein to continue to work on the post of Lecturer and to pay his salary despite :-2:- non-regularisation of his services. Against that order appellants preferred appeal before the Division Bench.
2.  That appeal was dismissed. Hence this appeal by way of special leave.
3.  At the time of the hearing of this matter after going through the record and after hearing the submissions of the learned counsel, learned counsel for the parties agreed that without making any observations on merits the appeal be allowed and the impugned interim order passed by the learned single Judge be set aside. Hence the impugned interim order dated 4.1.2000 passed by the learned single Judge is set aside. Learned counsel for the parties submitted that the High Court may be requested to decide the writ petition finally as early as possible because the dispute is pending since years.
4. Considering the facts High Court is requested to decide the writ petition as early as possible preferably within a period of six months.
Appeal is disposed of accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
