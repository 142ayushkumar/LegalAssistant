Indye Chemicals v Commissioner of Central Excise, Ahmedabad
Supreme Court of India

9 October 1990
C.A. Nos. 3855-56 of 1986
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is an appeal under section 35L(b) of the Customs 7 Act. The short point for consideration is as to whether the appellant is entitled to the benefit of the two Notifications, one dated 23.11.1961 and the other dated 1.3.1978 as amended on 30.3.1979. The relevant financial year is 1978-79. There is no dispute that the appellant is a manufacturer of Rapid Fast Colours and Rapidogens covered by Tariff entry 14-D. It is also not in dispute that these two items are covered by both the notifications.
2.  The appellant laid claim to exemption by contending that under the first Notification it was entitled to exemption in respect of Rs. 1, 07, 384/- and under the second Notification whereunder the benefit was confined to Rs. 5, 00, 000/- it claimed exemption in respect of Rs. 4, 98, 435/-. The Central Excise Authorities have, however, taken the view that the second Notification was in substitution of the first and, therefore, the appellant was entitled to exemption to the extent of limit of Rs. 5, 00, 000/- and in respect of excess there has been demand of duty and special duty.
3.  On hearing counsel for the parties, we are of the view that the Tribunal came to the correct conclusion by holding that the limit indicated in the second Notification was in substitution of the unlimited benefit extended under the first and, therefore, the excess amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000/- was subject to duty. There is no dispute that the items are covered by entry 14-D, therefore, the explanation-4 on which reliance has been placed is not available to be interpreted in favour of the appellant.
In these circumstances, we dismiss the appeal. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
