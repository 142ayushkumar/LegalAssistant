Paramjit Kaur v State of Punjab and Others
Supreme Court of India

28 November 2008
Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 6357 of 2008 in Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 497/1995
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard both sides.
1.  The petitioner's husband - Shri Kikar Singh was one of the witnesses in a criminal case pending before the Sessions Judge, Patiala. This petition had been filed by his wife- the petitioner herein alleging that the witness Kikar Singh was under threat and he should be given protection. This Court had earlier directed the authorities to give protection and we are told that the trial of the case is already over and that the witness no longer need any protection. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that there are other criminal cases pending in which the said witness also involved and so the protection should be extended further. We do not find any reason to extend the protection. If there are any such cases, the petitioner would be at liberty to approach the appropriate authorities. Without prejudice to such right, the Crl.M.P. is disposed of.
Petition disposed of
