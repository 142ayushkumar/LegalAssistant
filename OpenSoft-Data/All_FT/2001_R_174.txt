Ram Milan Pal and Others v State of Madhya Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

4  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15936-15937/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submits that the High Court was not right in dismissing the Letters Patent Appeal as not maintainable, treating the order passed by the learned Single Judge to be under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. He submits, impugned order is liable to be set aside and appelants be given an opportunity to contest the appeal on merits.
2.  It is not in dispute, the writ petition was filed by the appellants both under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. In view of the decision of this Court in Sushilabai Laxminarayan Mudliyar and Ors.Vs Nihalchand Waghajibhai Shaha and Ors., a Letters Patent Appeal would lie against an order on a writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.
3.  In view of this, the impugned order of the High Court holding that the LPA is not maintainable since it was filed under Article 227 is not correct. Accordingly, the impugned order is set aside. The case is remanded back to the High Court to treat the LPA as maintainable and decide the same on merits after giving opportunity to the parties.
The present appeal is allowed. Costs on the parties.
Appeal allowed.
