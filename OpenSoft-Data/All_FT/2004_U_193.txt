Union of India v West Coast Paper Mills Limited and another
Supreme Court of India

13 January 2004
C.As. Nos. 1061-62 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:

1. On the question whether the suit filed by the respondent in the trial court was within limitation so far as the claim preferred in Original Suit No. 1 of 1974 (renumbered as Original Suit No. 38 of 1982) is concerned, the learned counsel for the appellant places reliance on a two-Judge Bench decision of this Court in P.K. Kutty Anuja Raja v. State of Kerala,1996 Indlaw SC 3063.
1.  The learned counsel for the respondent has disputed the correctness of the view taken in P.K. Kutty case by placing reliance on a Constitution Bench decision in S.S. Rathore v. State of M.P.,1989 Indlaw SC 163 Prima facie, we are of the opinion that the decision in P.K. Kutty case needs consideration by a three-Judge Bench. Hence, adjourned for listing afresh.
Order accordingly.
