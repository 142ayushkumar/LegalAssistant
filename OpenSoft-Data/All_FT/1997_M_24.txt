State of Punjab and another v M. L. Sehgal and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 April 1997
C.As. No. 2345 of 1981 with No. 2346 of 1981 and S.L.P.(C) No. 2892 of 1983
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  An important constitutional question arises for consideration in these civil appeals and special leave petition. The post in the cadre is a solitary post of Chief Engineer in the service of State of Punjab. The question is whether for such a solitary post in the cadre the roster and reservation point can ever operate; or in other words, can there be any reservation as envisaged u/art. 16(4) of the Constitution for a solitary post in the cadre. The other question is whether the system of carry forward of the reservation points for future vacancies in the cadre comprising the posts can ever be applicable if the entire cadre consists of a solitary post. In the two latest decisions of this Court, one by a three-Judge Bench in the case of Union of India v. Madhav 1996 Indlaw SC 24361996 Indlaw SC 2436 and the other in the case of Union of India v. Brij Lal Thakur 1997 Indlaw SC 10761997 Indlaw SC 10761997 Indlaw SC 1076 this Court has taken the view that there can be reservation on roster points also for a solitary post in a cadre. In our view, these judgments require a relook in the light of the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Arati Ray Choudhury v. Union of India 1973 Indlaw SC 1411973 Indlaw SC 141 wherein the Constitution Bench was concerned with the question as to how the system of carrying forward of reserved vacancy can operate when there was a plurality of posts in the cadre of Headmistress.
2.  In the latter judgments as aforesaid, a view has been taken that the aforesaid Constitution Bench judgment is an authority for the proposition that even though there is a solitary post in the cadre, roster and reservation points can operate. In our view this aspect of the matter requires a closer scrutiny as we are prima facie of the view that the said reasoning adopted in the latter judgments runs counter to the view taken in the aforesaid Constitution Bench judgment which in fact dealt with plurality of posts in a cadre. There is a later Constitution Bench judgment in the case of R. K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab 1995 Indlaw SC 17561995 Indlaw SC 17561995 Indlaw SC 1756 which has proceeded an the basis that reservation points and roster can operate provided there is plurality of posts in the cadre and the Constitution Bench in the later judgment has indicated how posts in a cadre are different from vacancies. In the light of these Constitution Bench judgments the view propounded in the judgments in Union of India v. Madhav 1996 Indlaw SC 24361996 Indlaw SC 2436 as well as in Union of India v. Brij Lal Thakur 1997 Indlaw SC 10761997 Indlaw SC 10761997 Indlaw SC 1076 in our view, requires reconsideration. There are two other judgments, one is in the case of Chakradhar Paswan (Dr.) v. State of Bihar 1988 Indlaw SC 8831988 Indlaw SC 8831988 Indlaw SC 883 and another in the case of Chetana Dilip Motghare v. Bhide Girls Education Society 1993 Indlaw SC 16391993 Indlaw SC 16391993 Indlaw SC 1639 wherein a view has been taken that when the post is a solitary post in the cadre, the roster and carry-forward scheme underlying any reservation policy cannot apply. It also appears that reliance placed by this Court on Art. 16(4-A) of the Constitution of India in the aforesaid judgments in Union of India v. Madhav 1996 Indlaw SC 24361996 Indlaw SC 2436 and Union of India v. Brij Lal Thakur 1997 Indlaw SC 10761997 Indlaw SC 10761997 Indlaw SC 1076 for taking the view propounded therein, is prima facie misplaced as the said amendment also refers to a class of posts and not to a solitary post.
3.   The said amendment also is confined to the question of applicability of reservation policy in promotions for posts in a cadre and does not deal with the present controversy. As the judgment of this Court in Union of India v. Madhav 1996 Indlaw SC 24361996 Indlaw SC 2436 is of a Bench of three learned Judges, in our view, these appeals and the SLP deserve to be decided by a Constitution Bench of five learned Judges. The Registry is directed to take appropriate orders from Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for placing these matters before a Constitution Bench of five learned Judges.
Order accordingly.
