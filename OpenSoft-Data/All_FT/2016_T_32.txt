Tota Ram v Belliss India (Private) Limited
Supreme Court of India

1 April 2016
Civil Appeal Nos. 3273-3274 of 2016
The Judgment was delivered by : Anil R. Dave, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. Though the respondent has not been served, looking at the peculiar facts of the case, we have taken up the cases for hearing.
3. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant-workman.
4. On 1st February, 2016, the following order was passed by this Court :-
"Issue notice by speed post, returnable on 1st April, 2016, confined only to the question with regard to payment of compensation to be paid to the petitioner in a sum of Rs.2.5 lakhs (rupees two and a half lakhs only) towards full and final settlement."
5. Looking at the peculiar facts of the case, we think that it will be appropriate if the appellant-workman is duly compensated as he had worked for about 14 years. Therefore, we direct the respondent to pay a sum of Rs.2.5 lakhs (rupees two and a half lakhs only) to the appellant-workman in full and final settlement so that the appellant-workman may not be re-instated with back-wages.
6. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant-workman has agreed to accept the aforesaid amount. The said amount shall be paid by the respondent to the appellant-workman within three months from the date of production of a copy of this order.
7. If the respondent is aggrieved by this order, it will be open to it to move this Court by way of an application, so that the matter can be re-opened and decided afresh.
8. The appeals are disposed of as allowed in the aforesaid terms, with no order as to costs,
9. A copy of this order shall also be served by the appellant to the respondent in addition to the normal service which might be effected by the Registry of this Court.
