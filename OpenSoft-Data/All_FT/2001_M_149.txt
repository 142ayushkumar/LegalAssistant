Raja Ram and Anr v Mahendra Singh and Anr
Supreme Court of India

20 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2214/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Respondent No.1 has appeared through counsel.
2. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
3. By the order passed on 13.7.2001 notice was issued to examine whether the High Court was justified in making the observation which reads as thus:
"Therefore they are not entitled to be granted bail pending trial."
4. On consideration of the matter we are of the view that the High Court should not have made the observation quoted above while dealing with the petition for anticipatory bail. The observation is set aside. It is made clear that if the petitioners file application seeking regular bail the same shall be considered by the Court on merit in accordance with law.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
