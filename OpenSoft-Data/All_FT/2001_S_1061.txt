State of Punjab v Rupinder Kawal Sahib and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 November 2001
C.A. No. 7428 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The State of Punjab and Haryana is in appeal against the impugned judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
2.  The question for consideration is, whether the seniority of the respondent in the cadre of Research Officer would count from 6-4-1968, the date on which she joined on temporary basis after being selected; or it would be only subsequent to the order of the Public Service Commission dated 18-6-1968. It is not disputed that the respondent did possess the necessary qualification for being appointed and also had undergone a process of selection. But the appointment dated 6-4-1968 was subject to the approval of the Public Service Commission.
3. Since the respondent has been continuing as a Research Officer w.e.f. 6-4-1968 though the same was approved by the Public Service Commission on 18-6-1968 and she possessed the necessary qualification for being appointed and had undergone a process of selection, the High Court is wholly justified in coming to the conclusion that the seniority in the rank of Research Officer would count from 6-4-1968.
4.  We therefore do not find any merits in this appeal. It is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
