Regional Provident Fund Commissioner and Others v K. Mohammed
Supreme Court of India

29 September 1993
Cr.A. Nos. 186-88 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court quashed the proceedings initiated against the respondent-accused under Section 14-B of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952  on the ground that the prosecution was barred by limitation by virtue of Section 468 of the Criminal Procedure Code. This Court examined the question in Bhagirath Kanoria v. State of M. P. and held that such offence is a continuing one and even otherwise in a case of this nature, the court should give due weight to Section 473 of the Criminal Procedure Code to condone the delay in the interest of justice and entertain the case and accordingly this Court set aside the order quashing the proceedings on the ground of limitation. The ratio laid down in that case squarely applies to the facts of this case. The only difference is that in the other case the accused was the petitioner while in the instant case the State has come up in appeal.
2.   In the instant case, the offence is said to have been committed in the year 1973-74 and we do not find that any useful purpose will be served to continue the prosecution at this distance of time. Yet another important reason in the instant case is that the accused was only nominated by the Government to the Board
3.  For all these reasons while deciding the question of law in the above manner we, however, direct that the proceedings against the respondent shall be dropped. The appeals are disposed of.
Appeals disposed of.
