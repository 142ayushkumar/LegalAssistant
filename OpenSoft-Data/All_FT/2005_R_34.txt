Raj Kumar v Rohtas and others
Supreme Court of India

28 March 2005
C.A. No. 1841 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
We have heard counsel for the parties.
1.  The facts not in dispute are that the appellant as well as Respondent 1 were working as Safai Karamcharis in the respondent Municipal Committee. On 1-3-1999 the Municipal Committee selected the appellant for promotion to the post of Safai Daroga. It is not disputed that the eligibility conditions prescribed that the person to be appointed as Safai Daroga must be literate, inasmuch as he should have knowledge of Hindi.
2. On 1-3-1999 the cases of the appellant as well as Respondent 1 were considered and the appellant was promoted to the post of Safai Daroga while respondent was held ineligible for promotion since he was illiterate. It also appears from the record maintained by the Municipal Committee, including the seniority list, that the respondent was shown as illiterate in the municipal records.
3.  Two-and-a-half (2) years later Respondent 1 made a representation to the Municipal Committee stating that he had knowledge of Hindi and, therefore, necessary correction be made in the seniority list which showed him as illiterate. The representation was allowed and accordingly the seniority list of the year 1999 was amended in July 2001 to show the respondent as literate. Pursuant thereto the promotion granted to the appellant on 1-3-1999 was cancelled and in his place Respondent 1 was promoted as Safai Daroga. The said order of the Municipal Committee was challenged but the High Court has upheld the same.
4. The High Court took notice of the fact that in acknowledgment of payments made to him, Respondent 1 used to sign in Hindi. It also took notice of the fact that the representation made to the Municipal Committee on 25-7-2001 was in the Hindi language. It, therefore, concluded that Respondent 1 had knowledge of Hindi and consequently, he was eligible for promotion on 1-3-1999.
5.  We find it difficult to sustain the order of the High Court. The question of promotion of the appellant as well as Respondent 1 was considered on 1- 3-1999. The question is whether on that date Respondent 1 was literate, in the sense that he had knowledge of Hindi. It may be that after 2 (two-and-a- half) years on 25-7-2001 Respondent 1 represented that he had knowledge of Hindi and, therefore, the seniority list be amended to show him as literate having knowledge of Hindi.
6. The prayer was allowed and such an amendment was made in the seniority list. It may be that on that date Respondent 1 had acquired knowledge of Hindi. But that is not to say that on 1-3-1999 when the promotion was made, Respondent 1 was literate having knowledge of Hindi. The fact that the representation made by Respondent 1 in the year 2001 was in the Hindi language, is no ground to jump to the conclusion that he had knowledge of Hindi, or that in March 1999 also Respondent 1 was literate.
7. We, therefore, find no justification for cancelling the promotion already granted to the appellant on 1-3-1999 because the record as it stood then, and as the facts disclosed, Respondent 1 on that date was not literate, inasmuch as he did not have knowledge of Hindi. The record maintained by the Municipal Committee supported this conclusion. From such later date (25-7-2001) Respondent 1 may get benefit of his being literate but that benefit cannot be given to him retrospectively from 1-3-1999.
8.  We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 18-11-2002 passed in CWP No. 17579 of 2001 and hold that the promotion given to the appellant as Safai Daroga on 1-3- 1999 is legal and valid, and the appellant is, therefore, entitled to be reinstated with all consequential benefits. We direct accordingly.
9.  We clarify that as from 25-7-2001 Respondent 1 may be treated as literate having knowledge of Hindi, and any benefit on that account that may accrue to him thereafter may be given to him in accordance with law.
No costs.
Appeal allowed.
