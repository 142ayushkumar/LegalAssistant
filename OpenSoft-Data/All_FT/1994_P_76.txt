The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Parties' counsel report that the impugned order of the High Court been carried out in as much as respondent No. 1 has been granted admission. Now if we were to disturb the impugned order of the High Court, it would cause great hardship to respondent No. 1 as she would be left in lurch.
2.  We, therefore, grant leave, stay operation of the impugned order the High Court but without effecting the admission of respondent No. 1.
3. We make it clear that Mr. Bhat, learned counsel for respondent No. 1 is obligated to defend the petition and be of assistance to the Court but otherwise the result of the appeal would not affect the candidature of respondent No. 1.
Order accordingly.
