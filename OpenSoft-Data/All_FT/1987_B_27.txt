Bakhtawar Singh and Others v Jiwan Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

31 July 1987
C.A. No. 211 of 1973
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  In Kaur Singh v. Jaggar Singh , it was held by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court consisting of D. K. Mahajan and I. D. Dua, JJ., that in Punjab, a Hindu who is governed by the customary law has no absolute power to dispose of by will his ancestral immovable property.
2.  This decision has been affirmed by a Full Bench Decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Joginder Singh v. Kehar Singh . These decisions have held the field in Punjab for nearly a quarter of a century and we see no reason to take a different view in the present case, as at present advised.
3.  The appeal is, therefore dismissed. No costs. We are grateful to Mr. R. S. Narula, who at our request appeared before us to assist us.
Appeal dismissed.
