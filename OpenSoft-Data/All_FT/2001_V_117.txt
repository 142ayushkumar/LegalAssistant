Sunnybhai Chandrakant Fudanawala v Vishal Bittu Champakbhai Kothari and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 6968-6970/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  While we are disinclined to interfere with the order granting bail to the respondents we agree with the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the High Court should have avoided expressing on the merits of the issues involved in the case.
2.  The advisable course to be adopted by all the courts when bail matter is considered is to refrain from expressing any opinion on the merits of the issues involved in the case lest such expressions could have influencing effect on the trial court.
3. We make it clear that the observations made by the High Court in the impugned order shall not in any way be taken into account by the trial court while dealing with the trial of the cases.
With these observations these Special Leave Petitions are disposed of.
Petitions disposed of.
