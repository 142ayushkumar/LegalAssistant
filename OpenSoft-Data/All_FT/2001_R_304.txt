Research Foundation For Science (8-A) v Union of India and another
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2001
W.P. (C) No. 657 of 1995
The order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is distressing to note that despite the letters being sent by Prof. Menon to the Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun and to the Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi, no response is received by him. This shows utter callousness and lack of interest on the part of the governmental authorities either to comply with the orders of this Court or even to look after the public interest involved in this case.
2. Learned Attorney General, who happens to be present in court, states that he will take instructions. At his request, adjourned by three weeks. Mr Sanjay Parikh is given liberty to give a note to the Attorney General for his consideration.
Order accordingly.
