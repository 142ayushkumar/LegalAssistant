Proctor and Gamble India Limited v Commnr. of Central Excise, Bhopal
Supreme Court of India

16 January 2001
I.A.Nos. 1 & 4 IN C.A..No.3844/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  On 31.7.2000 while admitting the appeal we issued notice on application for stay. While so the appellant filed I.A.No.4 of 2000 seeking a direction which amounts to granting stay even before the case was taken up by this Court on the stay application. We have, therefore, heard these two petitions.
2.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties we are of the view that interest of justice would be met by passing the following interim order: so far as the impugned order relates to penalty, it is stayed, so far as it relates to the duty we direct the detention order dated 27.12.2000 shall be raised and the impugned order shall remain stayed on furnishing a bank guarantee in a sum equal to the amount of duty. The bank guarantee shall be furnished within two weeks.
I.A.No.4 of 2000 and the stay petition are ordered accordingly.
Order accordingly.
