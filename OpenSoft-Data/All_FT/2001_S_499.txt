V. Jagannadha Rao and Others v State of Andhra Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 February 2001
C.A. Nos. 9643-9644 of 1995, Dt. 22 February 2001.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The question for consideration in these appeals is whether the impugned order of the Tribunal striking down certain provisions of the Rules framed under proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution can be said to be violative of the Presidential Order issued under Article 371-D of the Constitution?
2.  Mr. Rao, the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, contends that this question has been considered and decided by the judgment of this Court in the cases of State of A.P. v. Sadanandam,  and Govt. of A.P. v. B. Satyanarayana Rao (D) by LRs., 2000 Indlaw SC 3182000 Indlaw SC 3182000 Indlaw SC 318 where in  the Presidential Order this Court has upheld similar provisions as the present ones, which have been struck down by the Tribunal.
3. Mr. Rao states that the rationale behind the aforesaid two decisions is that overriding power has been given to the State Government in express terms in recognition of the principle that public interest and administrative exigencies have precedence over the promotional interest of the member belonging to local cadres and zones.
4.  We are prima facie not in agreement with the interpretation given to the Presidential Order as in our view the provisions contained in the Presidential Order could be exercised by the State Government in favour of specific individual in the interest of administration an in case a rule framed under Proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution contravenes the Presidential Order issued under Article 371-D of the Constitution, the rule must be struck down.
5.  Since the aforesaid two decisions relied upon by Mr. Rao are two-Judge Bench decisions with which, prima facie, we do not agree, we think it appropriate that these appeals may be placed before a three-Judge Bench.
Order accordingly.
