Supreme Court of India

17 August 2000
C.A. No. 5656 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Revenue is in appeal against the refusal by the High Court to call for a reference under s. 256(2) of the IT Act of the following question proposed by it.
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is right in law in holding that investment allowance is allowable on the machinery employed in the process of extraction of granite from quarry, cutting the same into various sizes and polishing them?"
2.  The High Court declined to call for a reference because the answer to it was covered by its decision in the case of the assessee itself CIT vs. Mysore Minerals Ltd. 1992 Indlaw KAR 130. The judgment of the High Court in the earlier case, in turn, was based on its earlier decision in Shankar Construction Co. vs. CIT 1990 Indlaw KAR 1291990 Indlaw KAR 129.
3. That, as the name indicates, was a company engaged in the business of construction and it was the principle of that judgment which the High Court applied.
4.  We think, in the circumstances, that a question of law arises that requires the consideration of the High Court.
5.  Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The Tribunal is directed to refer to the High Court for its consideration the question set out above, having drawn up a statement of case. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
