1.  At the beginning of the hearing, we made it clear to the learned counsel appearing for the parties that we will be hearing Civil Appeal No. 2294 of 1986 only for laying down the law touching the questions that have come up for consideration and after pronouncement of judgment in Civil Appeal No. 2294 of 1986, the other matters can be posted before a Division Bench as we were told that the facts of each case are different, instead of spending more time of the Constitution Bench.
2. Now, since judgment in Civil Appeal No. 2294 of 1986 has been pronounced State of Maharashtra v. Milind, 2000 Indlaw SC 2635, these matters may be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for necessary orders.
