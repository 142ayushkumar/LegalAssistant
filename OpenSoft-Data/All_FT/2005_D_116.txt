Dr. Sudesh Jale v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

1 February 2005
W.P. (Cri.) No. 233 of 2004
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  A letter written by the petitioner was treated as this writ petition. Earlier to this writ petition, a habeas corpus petition was filed by one Dr. Jale, husband of the petitioner herein. In the said writ petition we had personally interviewed Dr. Sudesh Jale, the petitioner herein. She expressed her desire to go with her parents instead of going with her husband. After she went with her parents after the disposal of the said writ petition, she sent a letter petition to Hon'ble the Chief Justice stating that she wanted to go back with the husband but because of the family circumstances she could not do so. After we entertained this writ petition, we again interviewed Dr. Sudesh Jale and she expressed once again her desire to go with her parents which has given impression to us that she is under some pressure, therefore, we would like to find out what really the petitioner" herein Dr. Sudesh Jale wants.
2. With this view in mind we direct the production of Dr. Sudesh Jale through jurisdictional police on 3-2-2005 at 10.30 a.m. in this Court. We have identified a social organisation named Nityanandita having its office at 271, Sector 17A, Gurgaon for the purpose of counselling of the said Dr. Sudesh Jale as a resident. The police concerned will ensure that she is brought to this Court alone not accompanied by her parents or husband on 3-2-2005. The learned counsel for the State of Haryana shall intimate to the jurisdictional police about this order.
Call this matter on 3-2-2005.
Order accordingly.
