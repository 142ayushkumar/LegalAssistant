Karnataka Pawn Brokers' Association and Others v State of Karnataka and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 January 1994
C.As. Nos. 5078-5081 of 1993 with W.Ps. (C) Nos. 752, 727 and 793 of 1991, C.As. Nos. 5083-5091, 5092-96, 5082 and 5097 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment dated 7-3-1991 of the Karnataka High Court in a bunch of writ petitions wherein the challenge was to the constitutional validity of Sections 4-A and 4-B introduced by amendment in the Karnataka Pawn Brokers Act, 1961 and Sections 7-A and 7-B introduced by similar amendment in the Karnataka Moneylenders Act, 1961.
2.   These amendments were made in two principal Acts by separate amending Acts of 1985. The amendment so made in the two principal Acts are identical in nature. The High Court repelled the challenge to the constitutional validity of these amended provisions. Hence these appeals by special leave.
3.  Learned counsel for the appellants reiterated the very same arguments to assail the constitutional validity of the aforesaid provisions, which have been dealt with at length in a well-considered judgment of the High Court wherein cogent reasons have been given for rejecting all the arguments.
4.   We consider it unnecessary to elaborate on the reasons given by the High Court with which we agree. We find no merit in these appeals.
5.  Accordingly, the appeals and connected writ petitions are dismissed. The appellants shall pay the costs to the respondent State of Karnataka. The costs are quantified at Rs.10,000 one set.
Appeals dismissed.
