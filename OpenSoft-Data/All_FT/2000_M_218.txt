Messrs National Buldg.Const. Corporation Limited v Messrs Puri International Private Limited and Anr
Supreme Court of India

1 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.18959/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We find no merit in this special leave petition because, as rightly held by the High Court, the notice of demand is not in terms of the bank guarantees. If a notice to the Bank had been written in terms of the bank guarantees, possibly there would have been no difficulty in the encashment thereof.
2. Learned Additional Solicitor General states that a notice dated 15th November, 2000 has already been issued. This is one more reason why we should not interefere in this case. The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
