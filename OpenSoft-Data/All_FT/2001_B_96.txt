Manohar Vithoba Ravan v Balvant D.Ravan(Dead) Thr. Lrs. and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4297/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
The plaintiff-appellant filed a suit for partition.
1.  The defendants-respondents filed a written statement wherein it was alleged that the partition has already been effected by an earlier family arrangement. The trial Court dismissed the suit. The appellant thereafter preferred a first appeal before the High Court. The High Court, without considering the other issues involved in the appeal, dismissed the appeal merely on the ground that Ex. D-22 shows that there was already a family arrangement. Since we find that there are other questions which are required to be decided by the High Court, have not been decided, the judgment under challenge is not sustainable.
2. We, therefore, set aside the judgment passed by the High Court and send the case back to the High Court for deciding the appeal afresh on merits.
3.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
