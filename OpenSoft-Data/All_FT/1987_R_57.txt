Sohan Lal v Ram Prakash
Supreme Court of India

26 March 1987
C.A. No. 3517 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Despite the persuasiveness of Smt. Swaran Mahajan, learned counsel for the appellant who made a valiant effort to demolish the finding of fact reached by the High Court and the courts below that the constructions in question brought about a material alteration in the demised premises, we find it difficult to accept her submissions. The High Court and the courts below have found that the demised premises which consisted of an ahata with a dalan and a kotha inside it let out for the purposes of running a dairy. In this ahata, the appellant had put up a chhappar and then replaced it with a tin shed. He also raised a kuchcha platform and made it permanent. The limited question was whether the tin shed with pucca pillars and raising of the platform making it permanent amount to material alteration within the meaning of Section 3(1)(a) of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947. The High Court has answered the question in the affirmative and we find no reason to differ from it.
2.   The appeal must accordingly fail and is dismissed. We, however, give time up to March 31, 1989 to the appellant to vacate the demised premises on his filing the usual undertaking in this Court within six weeks from today and further on condition that the appellant shall pay Rs. 150 per month w.e.f. April 1, 1987 towards use and occupation charges to the respondent.
Appeal dismissed.
