State of Gujarat v Mahadev's Temple, Gujarat and Others
Supreme Court of India

8  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10933-10937/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard submissions on behalf of the parties.
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  On careful perusal of the judgment in the First Appeal, it appears that the same utterly fall short of the considerations which are expected from the Court of First Appeal. No evidence has been discussed, neither there is any discussion as regards the subject matter of the issue. We, therefore, set aside the impugned judgment at the admission stage itself and the decree passed by the High Court stands set aside.
2. We remand the First Appeal to the High Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law. It is desired that the matter be disposed of with utmost expedition. The appeals are disposed of.
No order as to costs.
Appeals Disposed of.
