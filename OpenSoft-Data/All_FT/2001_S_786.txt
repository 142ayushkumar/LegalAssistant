Anil Verma v State of Jharkhand
Supreme Court of India

23 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2228/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the parties. In our opinion, the impugned order places onerous conditions which virtually render the order of grant of bail infructuous.
2. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we set aside the order of the High Court dated 7.5.2001 and direct that the appellant shall be released on bail on his furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs. 25, 000/- with two solvent sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Deoghar, Jharkhand.
The appeal stands disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
