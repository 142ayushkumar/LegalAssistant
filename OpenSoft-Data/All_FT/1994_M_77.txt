Mahamadkha Gajika Baloch v Manager, Panchasara Jain Derasar
Supreme Court of India

23 August 1994
S.L.P. No. 12272/1994, Dt. 23 August 1994.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  We have heard learned counsel on both sides and we are of the opinion that this is a matter eminently fit to be closed by payment of compensation. Both the learned advocates were heard on the question of reasonableness of compensation. We think having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, the salary paid, the duration for which the petitioner would have worked had his services not been terminated and the income of the temple, it would be proper if the petitioner is paid Rs. 35,000/- by way of compensation, to put an end to the dispute. The amount may be paid within three months from today.
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
