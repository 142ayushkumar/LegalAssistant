Veluswami v State of Tamil Nadu
Supreme Court of India

25 February 1987
Cr.A. No. 230 of 1978
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. The appellant, Veluswami, stands convicted under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 for having committed the murder of one Samarasamm on June 13, 1975 at 10.00 p.m. by stabbing him with a knife at Perianaikenpalayam on the Mettupalayam Road, in Coimbatore District. The conviction is based on the testimony of PW 1 Rasaswami.
2. The appellant is also convicted under Section 307 of the Code for having attempted to commit the murder of PW 1 Ramaswami. The testimony of PW 1 Ramaswami, who was thus also a victim of the assault, has been accepted as true and reliable insofar as it related to the appellant by both the learned Sections Judge and as well as by the High Court. The matter rests purely on appreciation of the evidence and we find no flaw in the reasoning or the approach of the High Court.
3. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. The bail bond of the appellant shall stand cancelled and the appellant shall be taken into forthwith to serve out the remaining part of the sentence.
Appeal dismissed.
