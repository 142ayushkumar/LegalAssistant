Koman v State of Kerala and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 November 1997
C.As. No. 7646 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 306 of 1997) with Nos. 7647 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 1583 of 1997) and 7648 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 2181 of 1997)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Notice was issued limited to the point that the High Court having noticed the purchase certificate had merely observed in passing the order that the genuineness of the same appeared to be doubtful without recording a clear finding thereon when the statutory effect of the purchase certificate under sub-section (2) of Section 72-K of the Kerala Land Reforms Act is of significance.
2.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are satisfied that the matter must go back to the High Court for a fresh decision of Revision Petitions Nos. 2436, 1621 and 1497 of 1996 with advertence to the above.
The High Court would now, while deciding the revision petitions, give a clear finding relating to the purchase certificate on which reliance is placed by the appellants. The appeals are allowed to the above extent.
Appeals allowed.
