Supreme Court of India

25 April 2005
Cr.As. No. 616 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 500 of 2005 with No. 617 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 498 of 2005)
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave granted.
1.  The sole appellant was convicted by two separate orders passed by the trial court under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two months.
2. He was further convicted in both the cases under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years. Against the orders of convictions in both the cases, the appellant preferred appeals which were dismissed and thereafter revisions filed by the appellant before the High Court having failed, the present appeals by way of special leave have been filed.
In the present case, both the parties have filed a joint petition for compromise and they have compromised their disputes in both the cases.
In our view, compromise is lawful, as such we accord permission to compromise the same.
Accordingly, the appeals are allowed, convictions and sentences awarded against the appellant are set aside and he is acquitted of the charges in both the cases in view of the compromise.
Appeals allowed.
