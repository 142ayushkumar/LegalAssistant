M. D. N. Panikar and Others v S. A. I. L. and Another
Supreme Court of India

2 September 1986
W.P. No. 11843 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In view of the circumstance that the ministerial staff of F.A. & C.A.O. department is being paid overtime at double the rate of normal wages and in view of the fact that the ministerial staff of the Rourkela Plant other than the staff of the F. A. & C.A.O. department had made a demand even in 1962 for overtime wages at double the rate of normal wages, we think that it would be fair if all the ministerial staff of Rourkela Steel Plant apart from F.A. & C.A.O. department are paid overtime wages calculated at the rate of 1 3/4 of the normal rate of wages from February 24, 1962.
2.  The balance due to the workmen will be paid within 3 months from today. For the future, overtime wages will be paid at double the rate of normal wages from today. We are not awarding overtime wages at double the rate keeping in view the fact that what is now being awarded covers a very long period, namely, the period from 1962 onwards. We think it fair and just that the workmen are paid overtime wages up to date at the rate of 1 3/4 of the normal rate of wages.
The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
