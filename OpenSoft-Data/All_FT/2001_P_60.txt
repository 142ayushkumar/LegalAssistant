17 September 2001
IA No.2 in Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15534/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is stated for the applicant in the I.A. that before passing of the interim order by this Court on 7.9.2001 the animals in question were taken in the custody of Conservator of Forests. While they were being sent to Tirupathi the petitioner interfered on the ground of the interim order.
2. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we clarify the interim order that if the Conservator of Forests has already taken possession of the animals and they are on their way to Rescue Centre at Tirupathi, the interim order does not prevent him to do so.
3.  We, however, make it clear that while the animals are in 2 the custody of the State, the petitioners shall be permitted to inspect them as and when they desire. I.A. 2 for directions is accordingly disposed of. List the case for final disposal on 23rd November, 2001.
Order accordingly.
