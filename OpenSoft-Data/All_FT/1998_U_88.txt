All India Defence Estate Employees' Association v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 August 1998
C.A. No. 11418 of 1995 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 9 December 1992 and 21 January 1993 of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh in O.A. No. 788/JK/89 and R.P. No. 4 of 1993)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This appeal against the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal deserves to be dismissed as we are of the opinion that the view taken by the Tribunal is correct.
2.  The only question raised before the Tribunal was whether appellant nos. 2 & 3 were entitled to the benefit of one increment under Fundamental Rule 22-C on their promotion from the post of Technical Assistant to the post of office Superintendent Grade-II in 1988. The Tribunal held that appellant nos. 2 & 3 were governed by Rule 7 of the Civilians in Defence Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 1986 and not by the Fundamental Rule 22-C. We are also of the opinion that the appellant nos. 2 & 3 being civilians in defence services the specific rule applied to them and not the general provision contained in FR 22-C.
3. Moreover, the two cadres of Technical Assistant and Office Superintendent Grade-II stood merged with effect from 1.1.86 and the two pay-scales attached to theirr cadres also merged with effect from the same date. Therefore, there could not have been any promotion within the cadre in the year 1988. That being so, the situation of qranting benefit under Fundamental Rule 22-C did not arise at all because there were no promotion to a higher post or to a post carrying higher duties. As the claim of the appellants was misconceived it was rightly rejected by the Tribunal. We, therefore, dismiss this appeal with no order as to costs.
