Surinder Dogra v State of Jammu and Kashmir
Supreme Court of India

12 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.).../2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  The petitioner seems to be worried about the observation made by the High Court that petitioner is a public servant.
2. Learned counsel submits that this observation will stand against the petitioner and forestall his right to prove that he is not a public servant. We make it clear that the said observation was made when the petitioner disputed at the threshold itself that he is not a public servant. It is open to the petitioner to prove in the trial court that he is not a public servant. In other words the said observation will not prejudice his right to prove otherwise. With these observations we dispose of this SLP.
Petition disposed of.
