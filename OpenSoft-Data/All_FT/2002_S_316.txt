Madan Mohan Lilu v State of Delhi
Supreme Court of India

10 January 2002
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3726/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned counsel appearing for the State of Delhi. The appellant has been convicted under section 307, Indian Penal Code, 1860 and has been sentenced to imprisonment for three and half years.
2.  Against the conviction and sentence, the appeal is pending before the Delhi High Court. On an application being filed for suspension of sentence, the High Court having refused the same, the appellant has approached this Court. It is stated that the appellant is in custody for about one year. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are of the considered opinion that the sentence ought to have been suspended by the High Court itself.
3.  We, therefore, set aside the impugned order of the High Court and direct that the appellant be released on bail to the satisfaction of the learned trial Judge, Delhi. The appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
