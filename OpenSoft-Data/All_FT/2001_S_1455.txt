State of Haryana v Suvir Saxena
Supreme Court of India

4 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.2846/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The contention of Mr. Mahabir Singh, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner is that a Medical Officer who intends to join the Post Graduate Course is required to resign under the regulations. Prima facie, we find substance in the contention.
2.  However, in the present case, the respondents joined the Post Graduate Course in the year 1996 whereas he was informed by letter dated 10.6.1997 that in case he joins the course, he would be required to resign. This belated intimation to the respondent was impossible to comply with.
3. In view of special facts and circumstances of the case, we are not inclined to interfere with the matter. The Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
