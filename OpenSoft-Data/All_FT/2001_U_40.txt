R.N. Misra v U.P. Co-Operative Sugar Factories Fed.Ltd. and Anr
Supreme Court of India

20 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13578/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel urged that the view taken by the Division Bench of the High Court that Regulation 87 of the U.P. Cooperative Society Employees Services Regulation, 1975 is not applicable to the Society where the petitioner has been transferred, is not correct. On the contrary, the said regulation is applicable to him.
2.  We are not inclined to entertain this argument at this stage since the matter has been remanded to the single Judge. However, it is open to the petitioner herein to raise this argument before the single Judge.
3. The single Judge shall decide the matter in accordance with law without being influenced by the observation made by the Division Bench.
With these observations, the special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
