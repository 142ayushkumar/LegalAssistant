M. Poornachandran And Another v State of Tamil Nadu and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 November 1996
Review Petition (C) No. 2070 of 1996 [From the Judgment and Order Dt. 22 April 1991 of the Madras High Court in W.P. No. 8169 of 1983]
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  The record of the appeal indicates that Shri Sudarsh Menon was the Advocate-on-Record when the appeal was heard and decided on merits. The Review Petition has been filed by Shri Prabir Chowdhury who was neither an arguing counsel when the appeal was heard nor was he present at the time of arguments. It is unknown on what basis he has written the grounds in the Review Petition as if it is a rehearing of an appeal against our order. He did not confine to the scope of review. It would be not in the interest of the profession to permit such practice.
2.  That part, he has not obtained "No Objection Certificate" from the Advocate-on-Record in the appeal, in spite of the fact that Registry had informed him of the requirement for doing so. Filing of the "No Objection Certificate" would be the basis for him to come on record. Otherwise, the Advocate-on-Record is answerable to the Court. The failure to obtain the "No Objection Certificate" from the erstwhile counsel has disentitled him to file the Review Petition. Even otherwise, the Review Petition has no merits. It is an attempt to reargue the matter.
On these grounds, we dismiss the Review Petition.
Petition dismissed
