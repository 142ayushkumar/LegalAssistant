Carona Sahu and Company Limited v S. Anandavadivelu and others
Supreme Court of India

1 August 1988
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It has not been denied in the present cases that the petitioner tenants asked for time from the High Court to vacate the premises when the High Court was dismissing their revision petitions, and the High Court by its order dated 25-1-1987 granted six months to the petitioner to vacate the premises.
2. The grant of time was consented to by learned counsel for the respondent landlord. The respondent did not take proceedings to evict the petitioner in view of the order of the High Court granting time to the petitioners to vacate the premises.
3.  It is apparent that the petitioners took advantage of that order. Time was given on the unconditional statement of the petitioners that they would vacate during the time granted by the High Court. In the circumstances, we cannot permit the petitioners to file these special leave petitions and to maintain that they are entitled to continue in possession and that the High Court and the statutory authorities are wrong in holding on the merits that the petitioners are liable to dispossession. The conduct of the petitioners disentitled them to question those orders.
The special leave petitions are rejected.
Petitions dismissed.
