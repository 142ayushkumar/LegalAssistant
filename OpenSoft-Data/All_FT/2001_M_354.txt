Messrs Mahanand Ballu Ram v Hari Krishan Gupta
Supreme Court of India

9 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 793/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In this case complaint was filed by the appellant for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
2.  On 3.7.99 when the case was posted for appearance of the accused the trial Magistrate dismissed the complaint on the ground that the complainant was absent.
3. Though the complainant challenged that order before the High Court, no interference was made as per the impugned order.
4.  This court has considered the position in a similar situation in the decision reported in Associated Cement Co.vs. Keshavanand 1997 Indlaw SC 1230. There is no justification for the trial court to dismiss the complaint on 3.7.99 on the ground of the absence of the complainant.
5.  We, therefore, set aside the said order of the Magistrate and restore the complaint and also the prosection proceedings. The trial will now proceed.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
