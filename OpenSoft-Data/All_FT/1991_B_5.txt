Managing Director, Electronic Corporation of India v B. Karunakar
Supreme Court of India

5 August 1991
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 12103 of 1991 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 29 March 1991 of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Writ Appeal No. 1835 of 1988)
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  In Kailash Chander Asthana v. State of U. P. 1988 Indlaw SC 4741988 Indlaw SC 474 it has been observed by a bench of three Judges that the question of furnishing a copy of the report of enquiry in disciplinary held after Forty-second Amendment does not arise. But in Union of India v. Mohd. Ramzan Khan 1990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 577 another bench of three Judges had held to the contrary. In the later case it was observed that:
"we have not been shown any decision of a coordinate or a larger bench of this Court taking this view ..."
2.  The special leave is granted only on this question. The papers may be placed before the Chief Justice for Constitution of India, 1950 
 of a larger bench.
3.  Since the matter is likely to take a long time for disposal of the matter, any stay order would prejudicially effect the interest of the respondent in whose favour there is an order of reinstatement with liberty reserved for continuing the inquiry. We, therefore, direct that respondent be reinstated in service within a month from today with the payment of one half of the back wages
Order accordingly.
