University of Rajasthan v Mrinal Joshi and Others
Supreme Court of India

1  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7317/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  SLP(C) No.7317/2000, 7321/2000, 6341/2001 and 6345/2001 Delay condoned in SLP(C) Nos. 6341/2001 and 6345/2001.
We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
2.  These special leave petitions are directed against the interim order passed by the High Court on 7.4.2000 during the pendency of the writ petitions in which the High Court has directed the petitioner to permit the post-graduate medical students-respondents herein to appear in the examination and to declare their results subject to certain conditions including the condition of final disposal of the order to be passed by the High Court in the writ petitions. It is stated by the Bar that in some cases though the writ petitions were heard they have not yet been decided and the matters are to be listed for further hearing. Keeping in view the nature of the orders passed and the pendency of the writ petitions before the High Court, we are not inclined to examine the contentions raised on behalf of the parties on merits. It is our view that the writ petitions should be disposed of expeditiously and till then no further order should be passed or action be taken in pursuance of the interim order passed by the High Court which is under challenge in these special leave petitions.
3. Therefore, we dispose of these special leave petitions with a request to the High Court to dispose of the writ petitions expeditiously, if possible, within three months from today and till then no further steps in pursuance of the interim order under challenge in these proceedings will be taken by the parties.
Petitions disposed of.
