New India Assurance Company Limited v Tata Refractories Limited
Supreme Court of India

17 January 2005
C.A. No. 550 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 4401 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted. Heard parties.
1.  The National Commission has refused to condone a delay of 70 days in filing the appeal and dismissed the appeal. In our view, the delay is not so in-ordinate that it could not have been condoned. The National Commission could have directed the appellant to pay costs.
2. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order and remit the matter back to the National Commission for disposal on merits. The appellant shall pay costs to the respondent fixed at Rs. 5000.
The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
