NTR University of Health Science v Setti Padmavathi and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 August 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3699/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  In relation to admission of students in Under- Graduate Professional courses and, in particular, to medical colleges certain grievances were made in writ petitions filed before the High Court as to whether the allotment of seats should be based on the local area or the university area and not institution -wise.
2.  The High Court on the material available before it at that stage ultimately concluded as follows:
"In a situation like this, all that the Court can say is, if the authorities want to allow the students already admitted under Open Competition category allow them to prosecute their studies, at the same time comply with the orders of this court made in earlier writ proceedings. The selection shall be on the basis of local area or university-wise."
3.  However, in the course of making this order made certain observations. It is unnecessary to go into various contentions urged on behalf of the appellants inasmuch as the students had been admitted to the respective colleges as directed by the High Court. In the circumstances no useful purpose would be served by examining the contentions urged before us which are on the face of it only made ad-hoc for the purpose of the case.
4.  In the circumstances leaving the questions of law open, we dispose of this appeal. The intervention/impleadment applications shall stand disposed of as having become unnecessary in the light of this order.
Appeal disposed of.
