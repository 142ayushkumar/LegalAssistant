Noorjahan Khatoon v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

19 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 907/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner is the mother-in-law of a girl who died under circumstances which the police used for the offence under Section 304-B of the IPC. The petitioner and her daughter were among the accused arrayed for the offence. Both of them applied for anticipatory bail.
2. The High Court granted anticipatory bail in favour of the daughter but rejected the same as against the petitioner who is the mother-in-law. We are also not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner, however if the petitioner would surrender either before the police or before the court concerned and makes an application for a regular bail, it is open to the court to grant her bail after imposing such conditions as the court may deem it necessary. One such condition shall be that the petitioner should make herself available for interrogation before the Investigating Officer on the date and time fixed by the court. With these observations the SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
