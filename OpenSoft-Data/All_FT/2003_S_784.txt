Rakesh and Others v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

9 October 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Cr.) No. 1490/2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard parties.
1.  Considering the fact that this is a criminal case where the appellants have been convicted under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and have been sentenced to life imprisonment, it would have been preferable that the High Court hear the appellants counsel before dismissing the appeal.
2. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order. Criminal Appeal shall be restored to the file of the High Court. The parties are directed to appear before the High Court on 10th November, 2003 on which date the Criminal Appeal must be listed on the board of the concerned Court. The High Court may hear the matter on that date or any other date convenient to it. If the appellants counsel does not appear on 10th November, 2003 or on any other day on which the High Court fixes for hearing, the High Court may then proceed ex parte. Otherwise, the High Court to hear the appellants before disposing of the matter on merits.
The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
