Haryana Urban Development Authority v Rajnish Chander Sharde
Supreme Court of India

12 January 2000
Civil Appeal No. 5970 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. There is no merit in this appeal. Considering what has been stated by the appellant in its own written statement filed before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, we express our surprise that it should have filed this appeal at all. Learned counsel for the appellant now desires to confine the appeal only to the interest that has accumulated because of the stay order that was passed at the appellants' instance by this Court. In the order of the National Commission, it is stated that the respondent had claimed compensation for having been compelled to live in rented accommodation from 1982 till 1994 at the rate of Rs. 1,600 per month.
Instead of making that award, the National Commission directed the appellant to pay interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the amounts that had been deposited by the respondent from time to time from 1979 onwards till a new lot could be allotted to him and possession thereof could be delivered. Given the facts, we see no justification in interfering with that direction and, consequent upon the dismissal of the appeal and the vacation of the stay order, that direction must now be fully complied with.
2. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed
