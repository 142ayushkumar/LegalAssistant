Ashok v Chancellor, Nagpur University and others
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2003
C.A. Nos. 2733-2734 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard the learned counsel for the parties. We have also perused the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court holding that Letters Patent Appeal would not be maintainable since it was filed against an order passed in a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution, by the learned Single Judge. We, however, find that the writ petition was filed indicating in the cause title "Petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India ". The prayer clause also indicates that a specific prayer was made for issue of a writ of certiorari quashing the order dated 15.5.2001 passed by respondent no.1 to the writ petition, namely, the Chancellor of Nagpur University, by which the election of the appellant was invalidated.
2. In our view, the Division Bench of the High Court wrongly held appeal to be not maintainable, treating the writ petition confined to Article 227 of the Constitution. In view of the relief sought, as indicated earlier, the writ petition was squarely referrable to Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
3.  Learned counsel for the appellant has also drawn our attention to a decision of this court in Umaji Keshao Meshram and other vs. Radhikabai, W/o Anandrao Banapurkar and Anr. reported in 1986 Indlaw SC 651, on the point where, in similar circumstances the petition was treated to be one under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
4.  In this view of the matter, we set aside the order passed by the Division Bench and remit the matter to be decided on merits expeditiously. The appeals are disposed of accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
