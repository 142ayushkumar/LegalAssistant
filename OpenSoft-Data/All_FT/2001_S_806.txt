S.P.R. Education Trust and Anr v State of Karnataka and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13241/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We feel it expedient that the matter ought to be dealt with on merits rather than on technicality as has been so done by the High Court in the order impugned before this Court. The impugned order is set aside. The matter is thus remanded back to the High Court for disposal on merits on payment of costs assessed at Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand only). Such cost be paid within a period of four weeks from the date to the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
