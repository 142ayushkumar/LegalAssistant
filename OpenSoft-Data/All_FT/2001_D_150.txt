Dharamvir and Others v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

15 March 2001
Review Petition(Civil) No.170/2001 in C.A.No.4405/1997

The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There is a delay of 852 days in filing this review petition. The explanation seeking condonation of delay is neither satisfactory nor reasonable. The application seeking condonation of delay is, therefore, rejected.
2.  Even otherwise, we have gone through the review petition and the connected records. We do not find any merit in the same. The review petition is, therefore, dismissed both on the ground of unexplained inordinate delay as well as on merits.
Petition dismissed.
