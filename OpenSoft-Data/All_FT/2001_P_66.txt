State of Uttar Pradesh v Pannu Singh
Supreme Court of India

16 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.).../2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  From the list of dates we come across that a number of criminal cases have been charge-sheeted against the respondent. We are not sure, as to how much of them are pending now. If those cases are pending or there are convictions to his credit this matter perhaps calls for cancellation of the bail. It is open to the State for cancellation of bail if there are good grounds for such.
2. We dispose of this SLP without prejudice to the right of the State in moving for the same.
Petition disposed of.
