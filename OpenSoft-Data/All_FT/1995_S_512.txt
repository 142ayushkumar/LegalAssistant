Brij Gopal Chaturvedi v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

18 January 1995
Cr.As. Nos. 636 and 637 of 1988, Dt. 18 January 1995.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Since the appellant was ordered to execute a bond for observing good conduct for two years, the operation of which order was stayed by this Court on admission of appeal, one of the points which arises for consideration is whether the operation of the order be now revived on giving it a fresh lease of time. Almost six years have gone by. The appellant has not attracted any complaint of any untoward behaviour or misconduct. The observance of good conduct expected of him would now, if at all, have to be in future.
2. That apart, on merit we find no ground to interfere insofar as the establishment of contempt is concerned. Therefore, without any meaningful relief due to the appellant, the appeals stand disposed of. It is made clear that the appellant need not execute the bond as required of him earlier. No costs.
Appeals disposed of.
