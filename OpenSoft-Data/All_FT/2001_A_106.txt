Dir., Information and Public Relations Dept v Ajay Kumar
Supreme Court of India

29 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11954/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  After hearing both sides, we are inclined to pass order in terms of the notice issued by this Court on 16.8.2000 which reads thus:
"Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the petitioner will have no objection if respondent is taken in service as a fresh recruit. On this statement, notice to issue. Notice to issue on the prayer for interim relief also."
2. Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that respondent has already been reinstated in service on 14.8.2000. This reinstatement will be treated as fresh appointment and that will be continued as regular appointment. This relieves the appellant of the back wages prior to 14.8.2000.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
