Shyamjibhai Vithalbhai Patel v Purshottamnagar Coop.Hsg.Soc.Ltd. and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14972/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  The apprehension expressed by learned counsel for the petitioner that the observations made in the impugned order by the Division Bench may be used against him at the time of hearing of the appeal, if filed by the opposite side, does not appear to us to be well founded.
2. We have no doubt that if and when an appeal is filed pursuant to the leave granted by the impugned order, the same shall be decided on its own merits, uninfluenced by any observations made in the impugned order.
3.  We are not inclined to interfere. The special leave petitions are accordingly dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
