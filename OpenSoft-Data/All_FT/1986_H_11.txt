Harendra Nath v State of Bihar and others
Supreme Court of India

8 December 1986
C.A. No. 4451 of 1986 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 4968 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Special leave granted limited to the question of the date from which the appellant should be paid interest on the pension and gratuity amount etc., due to him.
2.  Heard both the sides. The High Court has awarded interest with effect from the date of the institution of the writ petition instead of with effect from the date on which the pension and gratuity amount etc., became due on his superannuation about four years earlier.
3. The appeal is, therefore, partly allowed to the extent that the appellant will be awarded interest from the date of his superannuation in 1981 instead of the date of the institution of the writ petition (i.e. August 5, 1985). The respondents will pay the costs of this appeal to the appellant which we quantify at Rs 2000.
Appeal partly allowed.
