Kuttan Vaidyan Sasidharan v Devaki Seetha and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.115/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard the learned counsel for the parties. The First Appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed by the High Court on the ground of delay. The delay in filing the appeal was nearly three years. The only explanation for an inordinate delay was that the counsel engaged by the petitioner did not inform him about disposal of the case.
2. On consideration of the matter, we are not satisfied that the High Court committed any illegality in dismissing the appeal on the ground of delay. In the facts and circumstances of the case, the special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
