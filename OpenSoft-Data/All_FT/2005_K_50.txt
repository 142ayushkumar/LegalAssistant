Chellammal and others v Kailasam and another
Supreme Court of India

13 April 2005
C.As. Nos. 5477-78 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (for short the Tribunal) awarded compensation of Rs. 8,08,704/- in respect of father of the deceased by applying the multiplier as 24 and awarded a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- for the son of the deceased. The High Court, on appeal, reduced the compensation for the father awarded by the Tribunal to Rs. 4,91,600/- by applying multiplier to be 12 and so far as the son is concerned the compensation was reduced to Rs. 50,000/-.
2.  So far as the compensation awarded for the son is concerned, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants is not in a position to assail the same. He, however, assailed the reduction of compensation so far as the father is concerned. It has been submitted that indisputably age of the deceased at the time of his death was 41 years.
3.  The High Court determined, annual loss of dependency to be Rs. 39,300/-, but it has applied 12 to be the multiplier and thereby fixed the compensation at Rs. 4,71,600/- and that apart Rs. 20,000/- has been added towards the loss of companionship. As the age of the deceased at the time of his death was 41 years, according to the Second Schedule appended to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the multiplier that could have been applied was 15 and not 12.
4. Accordingly, we direct that the claimant shall be entitled to compensation viz. 39,300 x 15= 5,89,500 and that apart she will be entitled to a sum of Rs. 20,000/- towards loss of companionship. The total compensation on account of death of the father of the deceased is thus fixed at Rs. 6,09,500/- upon which interest will be paid at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from the date of the petition till realisation.
5.  The appeals are, accordingly, allowed in part and the judgment of the High Court is, accordingly, modified. No costs.
Appeals allowed.
