R. K. Panda and Others v Steel Authority of India and Another
Supreme Court of India

19 December 1986
Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 34090 of 1986 in W.P. No. 617 of 1986.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. It has been pointed out to us that as a result of the direction given by the Steel Authority of India, services of a number of labourers would stand terminated from January 1, 1987. It is now pointed out that this order is likely to take effect from January 1, 1987. Learned counsel for the contractors says that their engagement is expiring on December 31, 1986.
In the circumstances, if we direct that the labourers would be continued by the contractor, then it would mean that the contractors will have to pay without providing work.
2.  Whoever be the new contractor, authorities of the Rourkela Steel Plant operating under the respondent 1 may instruct that the employees as far as possible would be continued. Mr. Shanti Bhushan points out that while making this adjustment, workers who have already worked continuously for more than three years' may be preferred.
We suggest that the Steel Authority of India and the management of Rourkela Steel Plant would keep this in view.
The civil miscellaneous petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
