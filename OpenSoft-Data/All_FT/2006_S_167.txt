Shree Ram Multi Technology Limited v Commissioner of Central Excise, Ahmedabad
Supreme Court of India

31 January 2006
C.A. No. 5989 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against the Final Order No. 175/04-B dated 25th February, 2004 passed by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (for short "the Tribunal") in Appeal No. E-1078/02-NB (B) whereby the Tribunal disposed of the appeal modifying the order-in-original of the Commissioner dated 7th February, 2002.
2.  The appeal relates to the classification of 'Tarpaulin' manufactured by the appellant. The manufacturing process of 'Tarpaulin' starts with weaving of HDPE tapes by the conventional warp and weft weaving on looms. The fabrics so woven is then subjected to coating with LDPE on both sides. Thereafter, it is cut according to size. Ropes are placed on all the four sides and sealed, so that the edges may not get torn at the time of use. After sealing, eyelets are affixed at
regular distances.
3.  The appellant started manufacturing this product in the year 1995. It filed its classification declaration on 1-11-1995 under Rule 173B, classifying the said product under sub-heading 3926.90 and claimed exemption under Notification No. 16/94, dated 1-3-1994 as 'Articles of Plastic' manufactured out of duty paid inputs on which no Modvat credit was availed. This classification declaration was duly verified by the departmental officers and no objection whatsoever was raised.
4.  On 4-9-1996, the Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Rural Division, having jurisdiction over the factory served the appellant with a show cause notice bearing No. E. No. V. 39/3-291/D/96 on the ground that 'Tarpaulin' is specifically covered by Tariff Heading 6306.00 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 (for short 'Act of 1985'). Accordingly, the Assistant Collector, rejecting the earlier classification made by the appellant under sub-heading 3926.90, made a demand of Rs. 10,18,116/- by classifying the said product under Heading 6306.00.
5.  On receipt of the said notice, the appellant changed the classification of its product to sub-heading 6306.00 and filed new classification list to that effect. Appellant also filed the necessary classification declaration, which was duly examined under Rule 173B but no query was raised with regard to classification of 'Tarpaulin'.
6.  After changing the classification of the said product to sub-heading 6306.00, appellant was served with another show cause notice on 18th March, 1999 saying that the appellant had classified the article manufactured by it under sub-heading 6306.00 whereas it should have been under sub-heading 3926.90. and demanded a differential duty of Rs. 2,11,26,368/- for the period August, 1998 to February, 1999. On 22nd March, 1999, the first show cause notice dated 4-9-1996 was withdrawn. Appellant filed its reply to the second show cause notice on 22-7-1999, inter alia, stating that the 'Tarpaulin' was specifically covered under heading 6306.00 and as such no differential duty was recoverable and, therefore, the appellant was not liable to any penalty.
7.  The Commissioner of Central Excise passed the Order-in-Original No. 3/Commr./2002, dated 7-2-2002 and confirmed the demand amounting to Rs. 2,12,61,286/-. The objections raised by the appellant were rejected and the Commissioner held that 'Tarpaulin' was classifiable under sub-heading 3926.90. Apart from the amount of duty, Commissioner also imposed penalty in equal amount.
8.  Being aggrieved, the appellant filed an appeal before the Tribunal. The Tribunal by its order dated 16/25-2-2004 disposed of the appeal holding that the duty demanded for the month of August, 1998 was time-barred. For the remaining period i.e. from September, 1998 to February, 1999, the demand was upheld. It was also held that since there was a genuine dispute between the appellant and the department, penalty was not leviable.
9. It was further held that the classification of the 'Tarpaulin' manufactured by the appellant was concluded by the Tribunal's decision in the case of Gujarat Raffia industries Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise, Ahmedabad reported in 2003 Indlaw CEGAT 44 and, accordingly, following the aforesaid decision it held that 'Tarpaulin' manufactured by the appellant using plastic granules as raw material is classifiable under sub-heading 3926.90.
10.  On going through the decision in Gujarat Raffia Industries Ltd. (supra), we find that the appellant had filed an intervention application in pursuance to the directions issued by the High Court of Gujarat. The contentions raised by the appellant were rejected and the 'Tarpaulin' manufactured by the appellant was held to be classifiable under sub-heading 3926.90. The appellant did not challenge the aforesaid decision and the said decision has become final against the appellant. In view of this, counsel for the appellant is not in a position to challenge the classification that the 'Tarpaulin' manufactured by the appellant was not classifiable under sub-heading 3926.90.
11.  Counsel for the appellant, however, argued that the appellant had re-classified the 'Tarpaulin' under sub-heading 6306.00 because of the first show cause notice dated 4-9-1996 issued by the department. That after reclassifying the 'Tarpaulin' under sub-heading 6306.00, the appellant did not collect the duty payable under sub-heading 3926.90. That since the appellant did not collect the duty from its customers because of the contradictory stand taken by the Department, the appellant could not be made to suffer for the same especially when the appellant had not collected the duty from the customers.
12. This argument is a valid argument for waiving/reducing the penalty but may not hold good for waiving the payment of differential duty. There is no provision under the Act for waiver from payment of duty and the duty can be waived by the exemption notification only. Once the 'Tarpaulin' is held to be classified under sub-heading 3926.90, the appellant is liable to pay the differential duty. Penalty has already been waived.
13.  For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
