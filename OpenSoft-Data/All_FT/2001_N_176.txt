Nita Kaur Mundi v Tejvir Singh Mundi
Supreme Court of India

30 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4461/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave is granted.
1.  This appeal arises from the order of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in F.A.O.No.54 of 1999 dated 30th September, 1999. The wife is the appellant and the respondent is her husband. The appellant preferred an appeal in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh, aggrieved by the order of the learned District Judge, Chandigarh in H.M.A.No.12 granting decree of divorce on the ground of desertion. When the case came up for hearing before the Division Bench, with a view to persuade the parties to have settlement, the learned Judges directed the appellant to be present in Court. It seems the appellant did not chose to do so. Taking note of that, the Division Bench dismissed the appeal on 30th September, 1999. It is that order which is the subject matter of the present appeal.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
2.  The appellant presented herself before this Court once and also filed an undertaking dated 24th March, 2001 that she would be present in the High Court when the matter would come for consideration of the Court.
3. In view of this undertaking we consider just and appropriate to give an opportunity to the appellant as well as the respondent to have the matter settled or adjudicated by the High Court. The order under appeal is delivered. The appeal is restored to the file of the High Court. The High Court will now proceed with the appeal and dispose of the same in accordance with law.
Order accordingly.
