Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Cr.) No. 4165/2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
1.  It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that he moved an application for quashing the proceedings initiated against him under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and in the said proceedings he also moved an application under Section 438 for anticipatory bail.
2. It is further submitted that the learned single Judge was pleased to reject the anticipatory bail and did not consider the question whether the proceedings are to be quashed or not. The impugned order does not indicate that the learned single Judge has considered the prayer for quashing the proceedings on merits.
3.  Having regard to these facts the petitioner would be at liberty to file fresh application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and if such application is filed the same shall be considered on merits uninfluenced by the observations made in the impugned judgment.
The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
