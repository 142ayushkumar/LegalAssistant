Verma will relinquish all his claims against the Management including the claim for reinstatement, back wages and the benefit under the voluntary retirement scheme, etc. if the Management pays him a sum of Rs. 1, 50, 000. Shri O. P. Malhotra, the learned counsel for the appellant agrees to pay the said sum of Rs. 1, 50, 000 in full settlement of all the claims of respondent 1.

Respondent 1 has no further claim of any kind against the Management. Shri O. P. Malhotra states that the amount of Rs. 1, 50, 000 will be paid to respondent 1 on his surrendering vacant possession of the quarters in which respondent 1 is now staying. Respondent 1 states that he would vacate and hand over vacant possession of the premises to the Management within two months.

The sum of Rs. 1, 50, 000 may be spread over equally over the period commencing from May 1, 1975 up-to-date. This direction we have given for the purpose of Section 89 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
