State of Madhya Pradesh v Bhanwar Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20855/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court by the impugned order refused to allow the application for impleading the legal representative of two respondents on the ground that the application was filed after a delay of 103 days. We take into account the fact that it was the State which moved the application. The ground urged for justification of the delay involved in finding out all the necessary details for making the application are also considered by us. We are inclined to adopt a liberal attitude, and hence we condone the delay of 103 days in filing the said application for impleadment.
2. Consequently the application for impleadment would also stand allowed. In the aforesaid terms this appeal is allowed and the impugned order is set aside.
Now, the second appeal will be disposed of on merits.
Appeal allowed.
