Shamim Ahmed And Others v State Of Uttar Pradesh And Others
Supreme Court of India

29 January 2008
Cr.A. No. 406 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 27th September, 2001 passed by the Division Bench of the High Court of Allahabad. By the aforesaid order the High Court has set aside the Government Order dated 11th January, 2000 and 25th January, 2000 granting remission to the appellants purportedly in exercise of power under Article 161 of the Constitution. Para (i) of the aforesaid Order provides premature release of the category of prisoners as under:
(i) Prisoners who had undergone 20 years of sentence with remission by 26.1.2000;
(ii) Male prisoners of 60 years or above, who had been sentenced to imprisonment for life and had undergone 3 years of sentence (without remission) by 26.1.2000;
(iii) Lady prisoners of 50 years or above who had been sentenced to imprisonment for life and had undergone 3 years of sentence (without remission) by 26.1.2000;
(iv) Male prisoners of 60 years or above who had been sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment and undergone 1/3 of the sentence imposed upon them or 2 years which ever is less;
(v) Lady prisoners of 50 years or above who had been sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment and had undergone 1/3 of the sentence imposed upon them or 2 years which ever is less.
2.  The High Court has quashed the aforesaid order on the ground that the power has been exercised arbitrarily and in violation of the statutory provisions of Section 433A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
3.  After hearing the learned counsel for the appellants and going through the judgment of the High Court, we entirely agree with the view taken by the Division Bench of the High Court.
4.  A perusal of Clause (ii) of the Government Order discloses the male prisoners of 60 years or above, who had been sentenced to imprisonment for life and had undergone 3 years of sentence (without remission) by 26.1.2000 and clause (iii) discloses the lady prisoners of 50 years or above who had been sentenced to imprisonment for life and had undergone 3 years of sentence (without remission) by 26.1.2000.
5.  Validity of Section 433A of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been challenged before a Constitution Bench of this Court in Maru Ram Vs. Union of India & Others [1981 (1) SCC 107 1980 Indlaw SC 577] in which this Court had upheld the validity of Section 433A. This Court also pointed out that even the power under Article 72 and 161 of the Constitution should not be exercised arbitrarily. Counsel for the appellants contended that the order of remand has been passed by the State Government in exercise of power under Article 161 of the Constitution which is quite different from the power under Section 433A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. While reading the order of the Government it appears that even assuming the Government has exercised power under Article 161 of the Constitution, it appears to be quite arbitrary and the High Court was justified in setting aside the aforesaid order.
6.  In the result, there are no merits in this appeal and the same is dismissed.
7.  We clarify that if any appellants have completed 14 years of actual imprisonment, he or they may approach the State Government/concerned authority for appropriate orders and the concerned authority shall dispose of the petition expeditiously.
The application for deletion of the name of respondents is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed
