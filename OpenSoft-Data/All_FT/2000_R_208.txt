Supreme Court of India

3 January 2000
S.L.P. No. 12794/1999, Dt. 3 January 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned senior counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel who appears as Amicus Curiae.
2.  Keeping the question of law open, we deem it fit to dispose of this Special Leave Petition by directing the petitioner to pay on ad hoc basis Rs. 500/- per month to the respondent in lieu of his reinstatement ordered by the Labour Court pending, disposal of writ Petition No. 3234/1995 by the High Court. The said amount shall be paid to the respondent from March 1, 1999 as order under Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act was passed by the High Court in the pending writ petition, effective from that date.
3. All arrears will be paid within three months from today and the future amount of Rs. 500/- per month will be paid from month to month till disposal of the writ petition by the High Court.
4.  The respondent, for compliance of the order of Section 17-B of the Industrial Disputes Act, will have to file appropriate affidavit as required by the said provision. On filing of such affidavit, the aforesaid amounts will be released to the respondent. Writ Petition No. 3234/1995 deserves to be expedited. We, therefore, request the High Court to dispose of the same as early as possible preferably within six months from today. The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly.
5.  We record our appreciation for the efforts put by the learned Amicus Curiae advocate in this proceedings.
Petition disposed of.
