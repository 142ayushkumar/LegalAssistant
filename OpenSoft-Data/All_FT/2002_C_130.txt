Supreme Court of India

14 November 2002
C.A. Nos. 4808-4809 of 2000 with C.A. Nos. 1858-1859 of 2001, 7898 of 2001 & 4221 of 2002, Dt. 14 November 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In these matters, the question is whether freight and insurance charges are to be included in the assessable value for the purposes of excise. This question is covered by the judgment of this Court in the case ofEscorts JCB Ltd.v.Commissioner of Central Excise, Delhi-II 2002 Indlaw SC 1171. The only difference which has been pointed out is that in the Escortscase (supra) the sale was at the factory gate whereas in these cases, the sale is from the depot.
2. Learned Counsel for the appellants admit that the freight and insurance charges up to the depot would be includible in the assessable value for the purposes of excise.
3.  However, the sale being at the depot, the freight and insurance for delivery to the customers from the depot would not be so includible as per the said judgment. With the above clarification, the appeals stand allowed.
Appeals allowed.
