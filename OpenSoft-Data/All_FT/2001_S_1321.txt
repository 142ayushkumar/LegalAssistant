Maujuddin v State, Government of N.C.T. of Delhi
Supreme Court of India

6 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2310-2312/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant was convicted for an offence under Section 304-A/338/278 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to suffer 18 months RI and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-. On appeal, the learned Sessions Judge maintained the conviction but reduced the sentence to six months RI and a fine of Rs.500/-.
2. During the proceedings in a revision petition filed by the appellants in the High Court, it appears that a report was called for from the Probation Officer with a view to consider whether or not the appellant be given benefit of The Probation of Offenders Act? The report of the Probation Officer was submitted on 08.05.2001. Copy of the same is available on the record as Annexure P-3 (Pages 21 to 28 of the paper book). Unfortunately, the High Court has not referred to the report of the Probation Officer at all and dismissed the revision petition.
3.  We have carefully considered the report of the Probation Officer and find that the Probation Officer has made a recommendation that the appellant be considered for grant of the benefit of probation under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958.
4.  While maintaining the conviction of the appellant for the offences for which he has been convicted, we set aside the sentence of imprisonment, including the sentence of imprisonment of fine and direct that the appellant be released under the Probation of Offenders Act on his furnishing bonds to be of good behaviour for a period of three years. The needful shall be done by him in the Trial Court.The appeals succeed to the limited extent and are disposed of.
Appeals partly allowed.
