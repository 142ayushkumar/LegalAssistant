W.B. Freedom Fighters Organisation v Union Of India & Ors
Supreme Court of India

29 August 2008
I.A. NO.5 IN WRIT PETITION (C) NO.68 OF 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Heard the learned counsel.
2. The grievance of the applicants in this application is that the respondent- Union of India has not considered the cases of the applicants for grant of pension under Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme, 1980. In the additional affidavit filed on behalf of the State of West Bengal, it has been stated that, out of 156 applicants, cases of 76 persons have been forwarded to the Government of India. Mr. A. Sharan, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Union of India, stated that three months' time may be granted to take a decision upon the cases of 76 persons forwarded by the State of West Bengal to it. We find that prayer is reasonable and must be granted.
3. Accordingly, we direct the Union of India to take final decision in the matter within a period of three months from today and immediately thereafter communicate its decision to the 76 applicants whose cases have been forwarded to it.
4. I.A. No.5 is, accordingly, disposed of.
Appeal disposed of
