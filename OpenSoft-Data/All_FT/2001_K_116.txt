Kanchan Udyog Limited v Mcdowell and Company Limited
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15350/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the High Court instead of setting aside the order of the trial court and remanding the case for a fresh trial, ought to have decided the appeal before it on merits on the basis of the evidence and the pleadings on record. This the High Court has not done.
2.  These appeals are, accordingly, allowed, the impugned judgment dated 18th May, 2000 of the High Court is set aside and the High Court is directed to hear the appeal on merits.
Appeals allowed.
