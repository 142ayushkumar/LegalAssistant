Sanjay Madhusudan Punekar v State of Maharashtra and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 October 2001
Civil Appeal No. 7008 of 2001 arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 4224 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. This court has now decided the question of law against the appellant. At the same time, it has taken notice of the passage of time and, therefore, made its order prospective, keeping unaffected appointments that had become final. This is an appropriate case in which to apply the same principle having regard to the fact that the appointment of the appellant was made long back. Therefore, the only order that needs to be made is to say that the judgment of this Court in State of Maharashtra vs. Milind and Ors., 2001 (1) Mh.L.J. (SC) 1 = 2001 (1) SCC 4 2000 Indlaw SC 2635 shall not affect the appointment of the appellant.
3. Order on the appeal accordingly.
4. No order as to costs.
Order accordingly
