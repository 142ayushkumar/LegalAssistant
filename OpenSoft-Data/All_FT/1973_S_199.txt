ON appeal the Allahabad High Court altered the conviction of Bhim Singh to that under Section 324, Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 18 months.
2. The conviction of Ram Singh and Krishna Murari was altered to that u/s. 324 read with Section 34, Indian Penal Code and each of them was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year.

The appellants thereafter came up in appeal to this Court by special leave.
3.  An application was also filed on behalf of the appellants that they had compounded the offence with Ram Sarup injured person. An affidavit of Ram Sarup was also filed and in that affidavit, Ram Sarup stated that he had amicably settled the matter with the appellants of his own free will and without any extraneous pressure.
4.  The offence under Section 324, Indian Penal Code is compoundable with the permission of the Court. As it is stated that the parties have amicably settled matters, it would, in our opinion, be in the fitness of things it permission to compound the offence is granted.

Order accordingly.
