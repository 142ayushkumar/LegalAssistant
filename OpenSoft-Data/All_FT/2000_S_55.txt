The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is a transfer petition in respect of a motor accident claim.
2.  The case of the petitioner is that he resides in Delhi, most of the evidence is in Delhi and the amended provision of the statute now permits a claim to be filed where the claimant resides. There is no opposition to the transfer petition except that the insurance company has also referred to the same amended provision.
3. We think that, in the circumstances, it is just and proper that the transfer petition be allowed.
