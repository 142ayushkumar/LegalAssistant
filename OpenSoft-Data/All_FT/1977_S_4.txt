1.  The subject-matter of both the appeals raises the same question of law and has been decided by a common judgment. It is agreed by on both sides that the appeals will be disposed of by the State Transport Appellate Tribunal, not in the light of the Government Orders which were extant at the time when the appeals were filed but in the light of Rule 155A of the Madras Motor Vehicles Rules as on today.
2. The State Transport Appellate Tribunal is free to remit the matter to R.T.A., if circumstances justify such a course. If at this date the stage carriages of both the parties are plying on the route in question, the status quo will continue till the final order of the State Transport Appellate Tribunal. With this direction, the appeals are disposed of. The parties will bear their own costs.
Appeal disposed of.
