Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3489-3508/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  By the judgment under challenge, the High Court has issued a direction that the respondents shall pay surcharge only at the rate of 18 per cent.
However, the contention advanced on behalf of the appellants is that the respondents are liable to pay surcharge at the rate of 60 per cent, according to the condition of the agreement. During the course of the hearing it has been brought to our notice that the Board, by a Notification, has subsequently reduced the surcharge from 60 percent to 24 per cent.
2. In view of the said amendment, learned counsel for the parties are agreed that the respondents shall pay surcharge at the rate of 28 per cent.
3.  The appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms. There shall be no order as to costs.
4.  Any excess amount which is required to refunded, shall be adjusted in the subsequent bills, which may be submitted by the appellants to the respondents.
Appeals disposed of.
