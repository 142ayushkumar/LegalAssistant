K. P. Singh v Executive Engineers (Uttar Pradesh SEB) and others
Supreme Court of India

14 March 2001
S.L.P. (C) No. 22359 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The petitioner is an advocate, and for the services rendered to the respondents as his bills were not being paid, he has approached this Court. The counsel appearing for the respondents states that a major part of the professional fees has already been paid, but as 13 bills said to have been submitted by the petitioner were not available, no action has been taken thereon, and therefore some time may be given to obtain instruction in the matter.
2. We are not inclined to adjourn this matter, as in our view this matter ought not to have reached this Court and should have been settled elsewhere. Be that as it may, the respondents would examine the pending bills, and if those bills are payable, will be paid to the petitioner within a period of 3 months from today.
3. The special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
