Collector Of Central Excise, Pune v Wander Ltd.
Supreme Court of India

27 August 2003
C.A. No. 4423 of 1997, Dt. 27 August 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Tribunal proceeded on the basis of an earlier judgment inCollector of Central Excise, Punev.Frozen Foods (P) Ltd. 1986 Indlaw CEGAT 244, wherein it was held that the commodity  Spert in question itself was exempted from tax. Therefore, the question of valuation would not arise. We do not think we should interfere with the order made by the Tribunal.
2.  Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant, however, brings to our notice a subsequent decision of the Tribunal inWander Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay- 1998 Indlaw CEGAT 27455 in which the product Spert is held to be only an edible preparation and not a dairy product. The claim made by the respondent that it was exempted from duty could not be disputed at all as it was exempted in view of the decision in 1986 Indlaw CEGAT 244. Hence the question of valuation did not arise for consideration.
3. The parties could not avail of the benefit of decision in 1998 Indlaw CEGAT 27455, as the decision thereto was rendered much later. As long as the commodity stood exempted from tax its valuation would not arise at all. The later decision could be applied in future cases where the question arises as to whether the commodity was exempted or not.
4.  In this light it is unnecessary to examine correctness of the decision of the Tribunal. The appeal is dismissed accordingly.
Appeal dismissed.
