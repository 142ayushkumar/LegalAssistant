Bansisingh Shankar Singh Parmar and Anr v Nandlal Ramavtar Gupta and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7611/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court, on a review petition filed by respondent No.1-tenant, set aside the judgment passed in the writ petition and remanded the matter to the trial court to decide the allegation made in paragraph 8 of the application after recording fresh evidence which may be adduced by the parties. It is against the said judgment of the High Court, the appellants-landlord have preferred this appeal.
We have heard counsel for the parties.
2.  In view of the facts and circumstances of the case we feel that it was not a case which required remand to the trial Court. The matter is pending for considerable period of time and the High Court itself ought to have decided the matter on the basis of affidavit or any other documentary evidence which the parties liked to file.
3. We, therefore, set aside that part of the order and send the case back to the High Court to decide the writ petition in light of the observation made hereinbefore.
4.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
