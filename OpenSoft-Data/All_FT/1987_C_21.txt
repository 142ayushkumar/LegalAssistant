Har Narain v Chandgi and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 January 1987
C.A. No. 4009 of 1982
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. In view of the judgment of this Court in Atam Prakash v. State of Haryana 1986 Indlaw SC 276, this appeal has to be allowed and the suit for pre-emption has to be dismissed.
2. The learned counsel for the respondents, however, urges that four of the persons who purchased the property along with the appellant Har Narain have not chosen to prefer the appeal and suit therefore cannot be dismissed into. It is difficult to agree with this submission. The purchase was a joint purchase and if the suit for pre-emption was filed against all the joint purchasers, the other joint purchasers are also parties before us thought they have not preferred an appeal. If the suit which is one for pre-emption against all the joint purchasers is to be dismissed against one, it has to be dismissed against all. We do not see any difficulty in setting aside the decree passed against the non-appealing joint vendees also under the provisions of Order 41 Rule 33. The appeal is therefore allowed. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
