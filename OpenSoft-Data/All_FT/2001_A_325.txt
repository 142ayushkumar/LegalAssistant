Avinash v Abdul Gaffur and Anr
Supreme Court of India

29 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...../2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Special leave petition is dismised.
1.  This SLP actually challenges the order passed by the High Court granting stay of execution of a decree of eviction from a building.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the High Court did not consider the main issue that no substantial question has been formulated in the second appeal. It is sine qua non for entertaining a second appeal by the High Court. The questions of law formulated by the respondent while filing the second appeal are thus:
" i. Whether the judgment and decree under challenge is inconsistant with the evidence on record?
ii. Whether the impugned judgment and decree is incorrect, perverse and illegal."
3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner highlighted that the above are in no way treatable as question of law much less substantial questions of law.We permit the petitioner to move the High Court for a review of the impugned order without prejudice to his right in doing so, we dispose of this SLP.
Petition disposed of.
