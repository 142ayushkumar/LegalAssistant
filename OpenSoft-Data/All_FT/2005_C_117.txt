Supreme Court of India

28 February 2005
C.A. No. 1459 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 14035 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard both sides.
1.  By the impugned judgment, the High Court declined to implead the legal heirs of the original claimant in the pending proceedings. The petitioner widow submits that she was not aware of the pending proceedings, so she could not take any steps to this effect. The petitioner is permitted to implead/substitute the legal heirs of deceased Prithvi Raj in the appeal filed by the original claimant.
2. We direct restoration of the case to the file of the High Court and we request the High Court to dispose of the same in accordance with law. We are told that the deceased Prithvi Raj has a living son. The present appellant shall take steps to implead the son also in the proceedings. The appeal is disposed of as above. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
