State of Punjab v Gurdev Kaur and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 January 2002
Cr.A. No. 730 of 1994
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Three accused were charge-sheeted and tried for the offences under Sections 304-B and 498-A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. All were acquitted by the trial court. The State filed an application for leave to appeal before the High Court. The High Court declined leave to appeal by the impugned order.
2.  The first accused was the mother of the third accused Balwinder Singh. We are told that the first accused died. The second accused is the father of Balwinder Singh. He is now 83 years old. The third accused Balwinder Singh is said to be the husband of Baljit Kaur who committed suicide on 20-7-1990.
3. There is not even a whisper in the prosecution evidence that Baljit Kaur was subjected to any demand for dowry at any time. In the light of this deficiency we are not inclined to send this case back to the High Court for considering the allegations on merits.
This appeal is dismissed accordingly.
Appeal dismissed.
