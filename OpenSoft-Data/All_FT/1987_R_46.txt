Ram Autar Shastri Tantrik v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

9 January 1987
S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 3413 of 1986 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 13 October 1986 of the High Court of Allahabad in Bail Application No. 11595 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Learned counsel for the petitioner has strenuously urged that when the petitioner was enlarged on bail on the last two occasions once for three months and then for two months he has conducted himself in such a manner that the other side has no cause for grievance. He contends that if the petitioner has not made any attempt to tamper with the evidence on those two occasions when he was at large for months and two months there is no likelihood that he would do so now. He also contends that it will not be possible for the petitioner to defend himself properly if he is not enlarged on bail. He has also pointed out though the High Court had passed an order to dispose of the trial within three months the trial has not even yet commenced.
2. In these circumstances, the petitioner prays for an order for bail from this Court. We do not think it would be proper for us to entertain a direct application for bail. It will be open to the petitioner to approach the High Court and urge the aforesaid submissions before the High Court. We have not doubt that the High Court will consider the matter in accordance with law and pass an appropriate order as may be warranted by the facts and circumstances of the case after hearing both the parties. With these observations, the special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
