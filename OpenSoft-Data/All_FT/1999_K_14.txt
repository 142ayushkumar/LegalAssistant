K. L. Arora v S. S. Prasad and another
Supreme Court of India

23 September 1999
Contempt Petition No. 317 of 1997 in IA No. 36 in W.P. (C) No. 4677 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This contempt petition has been filed on the allegation that the order of this Court dated 4-12-1996, directing payment of compensation has not been complied with. Pursuant to the notice issued by this Court, a show- cause has been filed clearly indicating therein that the applicant is facing departmental proceedings on the allegation of misappropriation of huge funds of the Company and until and unless the departmental proceedings are concluded, the question of making any payment pursuant to the order of this Court would not arise.
2. In view of the stand taken by the Management in the show-cause filed, we see no justification for initiating contempt proceedings, as in our view the non-payment of the alleged due is not on account of any deliberate violation of the Court's orders, but on account of the pendency of departmental proceedings.
The contempt petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
