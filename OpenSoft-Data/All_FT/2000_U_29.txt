Har Narain Bajpai v U.P.Sec.Edu.Services Commission and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20225/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave is granted.
1.  The point raised in these appeals stands covered by a judgment of this Court in Kiran Gupta and Ors. Vs State of U.P. and Ors.
2.  These two appeals were heard along with a batch of appeals in which the said judgment was delivered on 28.09.2000. However, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that in these two cases the original records were not produced by the Commission. For that reason these matters were delinked.
3. These cases are heard today. The learned counsel for the respondent has produced the original record of the appellants. We have seen the same. We do not find anything illegal to take a different view of the matter. These appeals are also disposed of in terms of the judgment of this Court referred to above.
No costs.
Appeals disposed of.
