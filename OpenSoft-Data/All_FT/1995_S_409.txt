Dasharath Pandey and Others v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

20 January 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Issue notice. Mr. B. B. Singh accepts notice. SLPs (Crl.) Nos. 4250 of 1994, 37 and 43 of 1995.
Leave granted.
2.  Similarity of the orders passed by the learned Single Judge strike us. The learned Judge has ordered release on bail of the respective appellants on furnishing a bond, but the effective release has been ordered on a future date ranging between 6 months to one year.
We have noticed identical orders earlier also. This seems to have become a pattern with the High Court in the manner of dealing with such matters. We regret to record that we are not appreciative thereof. If the accused is due for bail, then he should get it then and there. In case he is not due for bail instantly then the petition should be dismissed suggesting herein are somewhat pre-emptive of the duties of the court.
3.   In this view of the matter, we set aside all these orders of the High Court and remit these matters back to it for individual consideration on merits of each case. The appeals stand allowed accordingly.
4.  Copies of the order be supplied to learned counsel within a day and also be despatched to the High Court within the same duration for appropriate orders.
Appeals allowed.
