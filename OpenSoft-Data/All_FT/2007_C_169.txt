Commissioner of Central Excise, Gujarat v Zeb Monoplast Private Limited
Supreme Court of India

9  May  2007
C.A. No. 994 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Assessee is a manufacturer of monofilament yarn. It cleared the item in question under Chapter Heading 54.04. We are concerned with the disputed period 4-7-1991 to 3-10-1991. The Department on enquiry found that the assessee was actually manufacturing synthetic monofilament of 60 deniers and accordingly classified the monofilament yarn under Chapter Heading 54.06 (CSH 5406.19).
2.  Therefore, the narrow controversy in the present case is whether the product in question falls under CSH 5404.00 or whether it falls under CSH 5406.19.
3. To resolve the controversy we quote herein below CH 54.02, 54.04 and Chapter Heading 54.06 (in its entirety) "5402.00:Synthetic filament yam and sewing thread including synthetic monofilament of less than 60 deniers, not textured.Rs.100 per kilogram 5404.00: Artificial filament yarn and sewing thread, including artificial monofilament of less than 60 denier, not textured.Rs. 50 Per kilogram" 54.06 : Synthetic-monofilament of 60 deniers or more and of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 1 mm; strip and the like (for example, artificial straw) of synthetic textile materials of an apparent width not exceeding 5 mm-Monofilament.
4.  In the case of Sanghi Filaments Pvt. Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, Hyderabad reported in 1996 Indlaw CEGAT 855, the conceptual difference between undrawn filaments, monofilaments and filament yarn has been discussed by the Tribunal. We are placing reliance only on the conceptual difference discussed by the Tribunal in the said judgment. From the nylon chips monofilaments are derived and by the process indicated in the order of the adjudicating authority we find that yarn is derived from monofilament. Therefore, we have three different and distinct stages. In the first stage we have the nylon chips, in the second stage we have the monofilament and in the third stage we have the yarn.
5.  Keeping in mind the aforestated conceptual difference we find that under CH 54.04 the item is 'artificial filament yarn' whereas under Chapter Heading 54.06 the item in question is 'synthetic monofilament of 60 deniers or more and of which the dimension does not exceed 1 mm.' Hence CH 54.06 has no application. Further Chapter Heading 54.06 contains sub items. These sub items are put under the Heading 'Monofilament'. As stated above, the Department seeks to classify the product in question under CSH 5406.19 which falls under the Heading 'monofilament'.
6. As stated above, there is a difference between monofilament and yarn. In the present case we are concerned with yarn and not filaments. Hence the product in question falls in CH 54.04. In the present case there is one more aspect which needs to be mentioned. In the order dated 17-1-1994 (Annexure P-1) passed by the Collector of Central Excise, there is a finding recorded to the effect that the plant and machinery deployed by the assessee is kolsite 5 mm nylon filament plant, model KMF 4.745 which produces filament in excess of 1 mm. This finding itself shows that dimension of the product in question exceeds 1 mm. Therefore, it cannot fall under Chapter Heading 54.06.
7.  For the aforestated reasons, we find no infirmity in the order of the Tribunal. The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
