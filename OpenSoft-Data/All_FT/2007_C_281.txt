Commissioner of Income Tax v Corporation Bank
Supreme Court of India

19 July 2007
C.A. No. 1770 of 2006 With C.As. Nos. 1771 to 1773, 2188 to 2191, 2646, 3047 of 2006, and C.As. Nos. 138, 3186 and 3187 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted in special leave petitions.
1.  The short point which arises in this batch of civil appeals is whether interest earned by the assessee-banks on dated Government securities was liable to be assessed under section 2(7) read with section 4 of the Interest Tax Act, 1974.
2. In our view, there is a basic difference between loans and advances on the one hand and investments/securities on the other. This difference is indicated in the provisions of the Income-tax Act, the Companies Act, 1956 as well as the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. These aspects have been discussed in detail in two decisions of the Bombay High Court, namely, Discount and Finance House of India Ltd. v. S. K. Bhardzvaj, CIT reported in 2002 Indlaw MUM 168, as also in another decision of the Bombay High Court reported in 2002 Indlaw MUM 169 in the case of CIT v. United Western Bank Ltd. It is not in dispute that the Revenue has accepted the aforestated two judgments of the Bombay High Court. We are in agreement with the view expressed by the Bombay High Court.
3.  For the aforestated reasons there is no merit in the civil appeals filed by the Department. The same are dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
