Lalit Sood v Banarsi Dass and Company and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14011/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The point sought to be raised in this special leave petition is whether a certificate referred to in Sec.7 of the Indian Soldiers (Litigation) Act, 1925 has to be produced alongwith the filing of a petition for eviction on the ground envisaged in Sec.14(3)(a)(iii) of Himachal Pradesh Urban Rent Control Act, 1987.
2.  The High Court held that if the certificate does not accompany the filing of the petition then the petitioner cannot maintain the petition. We do not think that it is necessary to deal with the said legal question now because it is admitted by both sides that the petitioner is not now serving
"under special conditions within the meaning of Sec.3 of that Act or is posted in a non-family station."
3. He can now prosecute his petition before the Rent Control Court on the ground that he requires the building for his own occupation.
4.  Without prejudice to his right to prosecute the said petition we dispose of this petition. Learned counsel submits that on account of the pendency of the proceedings in the High Court and in this Court already much time has been lost. We permit the petitioner to make a motion before the Rent Control Court for expeditious disposal of the petition.
Petition disposed of.
