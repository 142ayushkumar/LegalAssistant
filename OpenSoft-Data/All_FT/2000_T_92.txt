The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
We are not inclined to interfere with the matter.
1.  The Special Leave Petition is dismissed. After we dismissed the matter, learned counsel for the petitioner stated that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises immediately, it shall create great hardship to him. Therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is justified.

Petition dismissed.
