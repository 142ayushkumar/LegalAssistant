Union of India and Others v M. Manu Neethi Cholan and Another
Supreme Court of India

20 March 2009
Civil Appeal Nos. 1791-1792 of 2009 [Arising out of SLP(C)Nos. 22963-22964 of 2007]
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  These appeals are directed against the order dated 7th September, 2007, passed by the Madras High Court in Writ Petition No.18920 of 2007 and M.P. Nos. 1 and 3 of 2007, whereby the High Court refused to interfere with the order passed by the Tribunal on 17/11/2006 in O.A. No.531 of 2006, quashing the order of transfer passed by the Ministry of Company Affairs, Government of India. Since then, the respondent(s) has continued in the post in question.
2.  The appeals have really been rendered academic on account of the long interval between the quashing of the transfer order and the order being passed today. We, therefore, dispose of the appeals without interfering with the order of the Tribunal, upheld by the High Court. But we make it clear that the appellants will be at liberty to pass fresh orders in respect of the respondents, in accordance with rules. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of
