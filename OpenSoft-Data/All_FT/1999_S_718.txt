Syndicate Bank v G. Venkataramani and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 March 1999
C.As. Nos. 1912-13 of 1998 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 17488-17489 of 1998), Dt. 22 March 1999.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The first respondent had filed Writ Petition No. 34958 of 1995 in the High Court of Karnataka, challenging his dismissal from service. The learned Single Judge who heard that petition disposed of it on 23-3-1998. The appellant Bank was not represented before the learned Single Judge as the advocates for the Bank, Shri Sundraswamy and Shri Ramdas did not appear as by that time they had not received the vakalatnama. The Bank then applied to the learned Judge to recall that order submitting that the Bank had sent the vakalatnama in time, but it was not received by the learned advocate as it was lost in transit. The learned Judge rejected that application. An appeal was therefore filed by the Bank against the said judgment but the Division Bench without considering this aspect dismissed the appeal.
2.  It is submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that the Division Bench ought to have remanded the case or considered all the contentions raised by the Bank. As it has not done so the order passed by it is wrong. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case and the rival contentions we are of the opinion that the Division Bench ought to have allowed the appeal and remitted the matter back to the learned Single Judge for deciding the same afresh after hearing both the sides.
3.  Therefore, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, we set aside the judgment and order passed by the Division Bench and remit the matter back to learned Single Judge for disposing of the same afresh after hearing both the parties. The appellant Bank shall pay cost of this appeal which is quantified at Rs. 2500/-.
The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
