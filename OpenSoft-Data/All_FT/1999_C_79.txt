Collector of Central Excise v Tulsipur Sugar Company Limited
Supreme Court of India

26 October 1999
C.A. No. 2824 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard the learned Attorney General. We are in no doubt that by the order dated 4th November, 1978 rebate was finally allowed and not on a provisional basis. To rebate that was finally allowed, the provisions of the trade notice subsequently issued, on 11th January, 1979, would have no application.
2. The show cause notice for refund of the allegedly excess of rebate that was allowed was beyond the period of six months and there is no case of suppression of misrepresentation. There is, therefore, no merit in the appeal and it is dismissed.
No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
