Bundi v Asar Ahmad Ansari
Supreme Court of India

19 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4177/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
We are not inclined to interfere with the matter.
1.  The Special Leave Petition is dismissed. After we dismissed the matter, learned counsel for the petitioner stated that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises immediately, it shall create great hardship to her. Therefore, some time may be granted to vacate the premises. We feel that the request is justified.
2.  We, therefore, grant time till 31.8.2001 to the petitioner to vacate the premises on her filing usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from today.
Petition dismissed.
