Akhil Kabir Panth Samaj v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 July 1987
W.P. (Civil) No. 786 of 1987
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the petitioner as also learned Additional Solicitor General for Union of India and Doordarshan and Mr. Desai for the Producer. It has been disclosed by the Director of Doordarshan who is present in person that the theme of Kabir has been split into a serial of 13, 9 out of which have been shown and  remain. This is a Friday serial on the television and, therefore, would be over in four Fridays to come beginning from tomorrow.
2.  Learned Additional Solicitor General has assured us that care would be taken to keep in view the sentiments indicated in the writ petition and the contentions advanced in court to ensure that nothing really objectionable is shown in the remaining four serials.
3.   The producer has told us through his counsel that the topic of Kabir was picked up out of respect for the great soul and in the expectation that these serials based upon the life and teachings of Kabir would help to elevate man by seeing the serials on the television. There was no intention of exhibiting any disrespect to Kabir.
4.  The Director of Doordarshan has undertaken to personally ensure a pre-screening again in order to make sure that there is no objectionable material.
5.  We must indicate that it is not for this Court to get into the facts stated in the pleadings and ascertain which is correct.
6.   It would involve a fact finding enquiry and the proceeding under Article 32 is not at all suitable for that purpose. This and the connected Writ Petition No. 756 of 1987 are, however, adjourned to August 21, 1987 by which time the exhibition of the remaining serials would be over. Prayer for interim orders is refused.
Petition dismissed.
