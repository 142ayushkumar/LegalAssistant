1. Leave granted.
2. Having regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case and considering that the husband of Appellant No. 1 died while in service, we are of the view that interest of justice would be met if one time compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs) is given in full and final settlement of all the claims in respect of the service rendered by the late husband of the first appellant. Ordered accordingly.

No costs.
Appeal disposed of
