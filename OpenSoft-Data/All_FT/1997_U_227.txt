Union of India v Anmol Trading Corporation Limited
Supreme Court of India

18 February 1997
C.A. No. 1064 of 1992
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The order of the High Court directed refund of excise duty. It did so because of an order of the Tribunal, the appeal against which has been dismissed by this Court.
2. The order of the High Court Directing refund was honoured by the appellants on 27th March, 1991, that is to say, well before the amendments in the statute relating to unjust enrichment.
3. That aspect does not, therefore, come into consideration and no other point is made out. The appeal is dismised.
No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
