Abdul Rehman Jami v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

24 November 1986
W.P. (Criminal) No. 1564 of 1985.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are informed by the counter-affidavit on behalf of the State of West Bengal, respondent 4, that a ban has been imposed by public notice dated August 19, 1985 on the export of human skeletons or parts thereof and that no such export is permitted from the State of West Bengal from that date.
2.   That does not, however, dispose of the question as to whether there are persons responsible for committing the offences alleged in the writ petition during the period August 19, 1985 and if so whether any action has been taken against them by the States concerned.
3.  We direct that State of Bihar, State of West Bengal, State of Orissa, State of Assam to institute respective enquiries into this matter so far as the matter falls within their respective jurisdictions and to take action wherever it is found called for, for prosecuting the offenders.
4.  Notice of this order will be served upon the States and the Chief Secretaries concerned. We trust that the enquiries will be completed within three months from today. The writ petition is disposed if accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
