Rakesh Bali and Others v Balbir Kumar Datta and Others
Supreme Court of India

29 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 119/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  In a petition under Section 482 read with Section 439(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code the High Court has reversed the order of learned Sessions Judge granting anticipatory bail and bail to the accused persons on 31st July, 1999, 4th August, 1999 and 6th August, 1999. The High Court placed considerable reliance on the statement of Mohsin Zaidi, a close family friend said to have been recorded by the S.D.M. and upon consideration of the fact so placed, cancelled and set aside the aforesaid bail orders. Cancellation of bail can only be effected on cogent reasons that are available or the materials being placed before the Court. It appears that the statement of Mohsin Zaidi was not recorded by the S.D.M.
2.  The amount of the materials placed, in our view, as has been noticed by the High Court in its judgment, was not sufficient enough to cancel a bail order already passed by the Sessions Judge.
3.  We do not wish to go into the merits of the matter since that might otherwise affect the trial. The cancellation of bail cannot be sustained.
4. Accordingly, the impugned order of High Court, whereby cancellation of anticipatory bail and bail was directed, is set aside and the orders of the Sessions Judge restored. The appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
