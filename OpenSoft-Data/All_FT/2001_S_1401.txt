Supdt., Krishi Talahidi Balakara P. Shala v Yalagurdappa Basappa Amargol and Anr
Supreme Court of India

2 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14762/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this matter, the Tribunal's Award stands affirmed by the learned Single Judge as also the Division Bench.
2.  The issue as to whether the respondents are workmen or not need not be gone into at this juncture because admittedly they had worked for more than 240 days in a year and in view of the concurrent findings, we are not inclined to go into the issue at this juncture.
As such this Petition fails and is dismissed.
3. We, however, record our appreciation for the trouble taken by Mr.M.N.Rao, learned Senior Advocate who assisted this Court as an Amicus Curiae at our instance.
Petition dismissed.
