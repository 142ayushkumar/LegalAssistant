M. R. Narayanan v V. Mohanlal
Supreme Court of India

12 April 1989
C.A. No. 2406 of 1989
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  In this matter when the appeal was heard by the High Court, it appears that the counsel for the appellant and also the appellant were not present. The learned judge, therefore, proceeded to dispose of the matter ex parte without any opportunity to the appellant of being heard.
2.   Subsequently an application was submitted by the counsel and later on by the party also for re-hearing of the appeal. Unfortunately, the learned judge by a short order rejected the prayer and maintained his original order.
3.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties, it appears to us that the High Court was not justified in rejecting the prayer for re-hearing. The appellant appears to have engaged a counsel who as not afforded an opportunity of hearing. That apart, there was no proper assistance to the High Court when it disposed of the revision petition. There is no reason for hustling through in a matter where serious questions affecting the rights of parties arise for determination. The High Court should not give that impression to the litigant public.
4.  The judgment of the High Court is, therefore set aside and the matter is sent back to the High Court for fresh disposal on merits and in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible preferably within six months from the date of reopening.
5.  Hon'ble the Chief Justice is requested to assign the revision application before the High Court to any other Judge, as the Judge who had heard the matter has already formed an opinion on this question.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
