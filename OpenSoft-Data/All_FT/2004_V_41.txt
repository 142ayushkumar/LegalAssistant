Transfer Petition (C) No. 797 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Despite service of notice, the respondent is neither present nor represented.
2.  This petition is by the wife seeking transfer of HMA Petition No.38/27 of 2003, titled as Vijay Kumar v. Veena, pending in the Court of the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Lakshman Garh, District Alwar, Rajasthan, to the Court of the District Judge, Karnal, Haryana, on the grounds that there is a long distance between Karnal and Lakshman Garh; the petitioner has three minor children; and she has no sufficient source of income to attend the court proceedings at Lakshman Garh.
