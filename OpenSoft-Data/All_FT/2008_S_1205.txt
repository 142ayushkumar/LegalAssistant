Criminal Appeal Nos. 2077-2078 of 2008 (Arising out of SLP(Crl.) Nos. 4462-4463 of 2008)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  These appeals are directed against an order dated 01.04.2008 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in Criminal Original Petition Nos.7042 and 6932 of 2008 granting anticipatory bail to the appellant on certain conditions. According to the appellants, the conditions imposed were unreasonable and unjust. However, it was brought to our notice by Mr.Ranjit Kumar,learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants that the appellants have already filed an application for modification of the conditions imposed by the High Court while granting anticipatory bail to the appellants. That being the position, we request the High Court to decide the said application at an early date preferably within one month from this date. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
2.  In the meantime, no coercive steps should be taken by the respondent against the appellants.
Appeals disposed of
