Supreme Court of India

23 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4448/2001
The order of the Court was as follows:
We do not find any merit in this petition.
1.  The special leave petition is dismissed. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that in case the petitioner is required to vacate the premises in question immediately, he would be put to great hardship and for that reason the petitioner may be granted some time to vacate the premises. Learned counsel for the respondent has no objection.
2. We, accordingly, direct that the petitioner shall not be dispossessed from the premises till 31st December, 2001 provided he files an undertaking to this effect in this Court within four weeks from today.
Petition dismissed.
