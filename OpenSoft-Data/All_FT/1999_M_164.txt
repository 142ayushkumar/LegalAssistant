Mukand Ltd v Commissioner Of Customs (Airport), Mumbai
Supreme Court of India

8 December 1999
C.A. No. 246 of 1998, Dt. 8 December 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is a contract that contemplates the supply of basic design and engineering drawings and the supervision of erection, testing and commissioning based thereon. One is as much a part and a condition of the contract as the other.
2. We find, therefore, no merit in the appeal. It is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
