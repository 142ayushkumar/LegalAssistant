The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This is an application for transfer filed at the instance of the wife petitioner u/s. 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking transfer of Marriage Petition No. 693 of 2007 (Shailendra Sailani Vs. Purnima Sailani) now pending in the Family Court at Allahabad to a Court of competent jurisdiction at Kalyan and Ulhasnagar, Distt. Thane, Maharashtra.
2.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after going through the materials on record and considering the fact that a petition u/s. 125 of the Cr. PC is already pending before the Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Ulhasnagar, Maharashtra and considering the fact that the wife petitioner is having one minor daughter named, Kavya, born on 27th of March, 2002, it would be difficult for her to attend the Court proceedings at Allahabad, we feel it proper to transfer the case from Family Court of Allahabad to Family Court at Ulhasnagar, Distt.
