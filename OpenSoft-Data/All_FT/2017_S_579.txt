3. The State of U.P. is aggrieved, since it did not get an opportunity before the High Court to file their counter affidavit and argue their case.
4. On going through the judgment, it is seen that the State was impleaded only for the sake of completing the procedural formality at the time of passing the final order. However, certain directions were issued to the State in the impugned order.

The appellant is given a period of one month to file counter affidavit, if any, before the High Court and two weeks thereafter for the writ petitioner to file the rejoinder affidavit, if any.
