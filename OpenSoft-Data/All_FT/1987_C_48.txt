Cit, Bhopal v Messrs Tawarfe Motilal
Supreme Court of India

11 November 1987
C.A. No. 739 of 1975
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The only point raised before the High Court by learned counsel for the assessee (the respondent before us) was that Section 68 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was attracted by reason of Section 297(2)(d)(ii) of that Act and that therefore, the penalty imposed could not be levied for the assessment year 1958-59.
2.  It was contended that although Section 297(2)(d)(ii) of the Act permitted the application of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, 1978 Indlaw CAL 8903, Bhogilal Virchand v. CIT 1980 Indlaw MUM 3934, CIT v. Dharamchand Anandkumar 1979 Indlaw MP 50, CIT v. R. Dalmia 1984 Indlaw DEL 94 and CIT v. Bihar Cotton Mills Ltd. 1986 Indlaw PAT 57.
3. We are in agreement with the declaration of law made by the High Courts in these cases and we hold that Section 68 of the Income tax Act must be regarded as a substantive provision. That being so, Section 68 could not be invoked and therefore, this appeal must be allowed.
4. The appeal is allowed, the judgment of the High Court dated August 30, 1974 is set aside and the answer returned by the High Court to the second question referred to is reversed. The question is answered in the affirmative in favour of the revenue and against the assessee. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There is no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
