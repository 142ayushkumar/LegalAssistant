V. K. Javali v State of Mysore and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 January 1987
C.A. No. 1366(N) of 1973
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. An appeal preferred by the appellant to the Governor under Rule 57(5) of the Bombay Civil Services (Conduct, Discipline and Appeal) Rules (Rules) was withheld by the State Government on the ground that the appeal had not been preferred within time, in exercise of powers under Rule 64(3) which reads
2.. An appeal may be withheld by a Local Government or the Governor-General in Council if -
(3) it is not preferred within six months after the date on which the appellant was informed of the order appealed against, and no reasonable cause is shown for the delay
3. We are of the opinion that regardless of the question whether there was some slight delay, the State Government ought not have withheld the appeal inasmuch as it had power to condone the delay on sufficient cause being shown. If the appellant has a just claim on merits, it would not be appropriates for the State to seek shelter under such a technical plea as delay in order to defeat his claim otherwise than on merits. He should not be deprived of his right to prefer the appeal by invoking Rule 64(3) of the Rules.
4. We, therefore, direct the State Government to forward the appeal preferred by the appellant to the Governor for a decision on merits in accordance with law in exercise of powers under Rule 57(5), within 90 days. The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
