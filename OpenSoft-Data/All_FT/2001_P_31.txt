A.Marimuthu v P.Ganesan
Supreme Court of India

2 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13428/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  It is true that the High Court had decided the matter on the merits. But, it does not mean that the revision was decided after hearing the appellant. Admittedly, appellant's counsel was not heard. We are satisfied that the appellant has made out sufficient cause for recall of the order dated 30.7.1999.
2. Under such circumstances, the judgment under challenge dated 6.3.2000 is set aside and the case is sent back to the High Court for deciding the matter on merits after hearing the parties.
3.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
