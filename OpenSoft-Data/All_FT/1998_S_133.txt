C.As. No. 5429 of 1998 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 943 of 1998) with Nos. 5430-34 of 1998 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (C) Nos. 22887 of 1997, 1686, 1882, 9850 and 13113of 1998)
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We do not think that any case is made out for interference with the judgment under appeals. However, we consider it necessary that the word "court" occurring in the following sentence in the judgment of this Court in Ram Piari v. Land Acquisition Collector, Solan 1996 Indlaw SC 3044 needs clarification:
"The development authority is directed to recover the amount and pay the amount so recovered at the rate determined by the court to the respective landowners."
2.  While agreeing with the High Court that the word "court" occurring in the above sentence means "District Court", we make it clear that the amount payable by the appellant to the respective landowners is the amount as awarded by the District Judge/Court.
3.  The appeals are accordingly disposed of with no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
