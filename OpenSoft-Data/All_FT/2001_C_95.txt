R. Venugopal and Anr v Challamma and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.1136/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. In the present case it is the admitted fact that for a consideration of Rs.32, 000/- the property was agreed to be sold.
2. However, as a part of the property was sold by the respondent the court has passed a decree for specific performance in respect of remaining part of the property. The court has also directed payment of remaining amount of Rs.7,000/- to the defendant on the execution of the sale deed.
3.  In our view, it appears that there is some error in calculating the amount as only Rs.15, 000/- was paid by the plaintiff to the defendant. So remaining amount of Rs.17,000/- is required to be paid at the time of execution of sale deed in favour of the plaintiff and we order accordinlgy. With the aforesaid modificationthis special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
