Commissioner of Income Tax v Gurjit Singh Mansahia and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 December 2000
C.As. Nos. 4103 to 4105 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court of Punjab and Haryana declined to call for a reference, at the behest of the Revenue, of the following question:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Appellate Tribunal was right in law in holding that in case capital gains arising from the sale of agricultural land are to be taxed, the assessee has the option to substitute its cost as on February 28, 1970, the date from which the agricultural lands, due to an amendment in law, became an asset ?"
2.  It did so because in its view no referable question of law arose.
3. It is difficult to agree with the High Court for it seems to us clear that the question is a question of law and requires the consideration of the High Court.
4.  Accordingly, the appeals are allowed. The orders under appeal are set aside. The Tribunal shall refer to the High Court for its consideration the question abovequoted, having drawn up a statement of case. No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
