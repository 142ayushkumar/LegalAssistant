1. Leave granted.
2. Heard the learned counsel for the parties. Looking at the evidence and the concurrent findings of fact, we do not find that this is a case where the conviction can be set aside.
3. We have noted the fact that the appellant was a Constable, working under a Sub-Inspector of Police, and the said Sub-Inspector was also involved in the same offence.
4. Looking at the facts of the case and more particularly, in view of the fact that the appellant was a subordinate policeman, who was working under the Sub-Inspector and under his direction the appellant was also involved in the offence, we are of the view that imposition of little less sentence upon the appellant would serve the purpose.
5. In view of the above, we reduce the sentence of the appellant to one year and also direct that all the sentences shall run concurrently and not consecutively.
The appeal is allowed with the above modification in the judgment.
Appeal allowed
