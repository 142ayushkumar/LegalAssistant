Barada Kanta Mishra v Orissa High Court
Supreme Court of India

15 September 1975
Cr.A. No. 72 of 1975.
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Having heard the appellant in person and Mr. F. S. Nariman for the respondent, we are of opinion that this appeal is not maintainable.
2. Only those orders or decisions in which some point is decided or finding is given in the exercise of jurisdiction by the High Court to punish for contempt, are appealable u/s. 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
3. The order in question is not such an order or decision. It is an interlocutory order pertaining purely to the procedure of the Court.
4. All that the order in question says is that all the points arising in the case, including the one of maintainability of the proceedings, would be heard together and it rejected Mr. B. Mishra's prayer for hearing the case piecemeal, that is, first with regard to the question of maintainability.
Accordingly we dismiss the appeal. The stay in consequence stands vacated.
Appeal dismissed.
