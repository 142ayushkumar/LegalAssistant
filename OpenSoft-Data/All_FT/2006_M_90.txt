Mahesh Chandra v State of Uttar Pradesh and others
Supreme Court of India

1  May  2006
Cr.A. No. 510 of 2006 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 713 of 2004)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
We have heard counsel for the parties.
Special leave granted.
1.  As a condition for grant of anticipatory bail, the High Court has recorded the undertaking of the petitioners to pay to the victim daughter-in-law a sum of Rs.2000 per month and failure to do so would result in vacation of the order granting bail. We notice that the applicants before the High Court were the jeth and jethani of the victim. We fail to understand how they can be made liable to deposit Rs.2000 per month for the maintenance of the victim.
2. Moreover, while deciding a bail application, it is not the jurisdiction of the court to decide civil disputes as between the parties. We, therefore, remit the matter to the High Court to consider the bail application afresh on merit and to pass an appropriate order without imposing any condition of the nature imposed by the impugned order.
3.  This appeal is, accordingly, allowed to the extent indicated above. Till the matter is decided by the High Court, the petitioners shall continue on provisional bail.
Appeal allowed.
