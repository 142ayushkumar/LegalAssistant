Govind Behari Goswami v Management Committee Bankey B.Maharaj
Supreme Court of India

20 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20629/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  A Writ petition was presented before the High Court challenging the order made by the Civil Judge(Junior Division) Mathura on Application No. 125 of 2000 which was an offshoot of a Scheme framed in Original Suit No. 156 of 1938.
2. However, the High Court dismissed the petition against that order observing that the appellant has an alternative remedy under Code of Civil Procedure. Hence this appeal.
3.  The order made by the learned Judge is not in exercise of powers of a Civil Court but as a named person or authority under the Scheme. In that view of the matter, the order made by the High Court is set aside and the Writ Petition is remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration in accordance with law.
The appeal is allowed. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
