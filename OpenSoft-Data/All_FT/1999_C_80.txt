Baidyanath Ayurved Bhavan Limited v Collector of Central Excise, Allahabad
Supreme Court of India

17 November 1999
C.A. Nos. 3604-3605 0f 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We find that there are four issues involved in these appeals but that three hinge on this one question:
2. Was the show cause notice dated 27th August, 1987 beyond time The period in question is 28th August, 1982 to 28th February, 1986. The notice would be in time if the Revenue could invoke the extended period under Section 11A on the ground that the assessee had been guilty of fraud, misrepresentation or wilful suppression. It is patent from the facts recorded by the Tribunal that there was no wilful suppression, let alone fraud or misrepresentation. That the assessee was not responding to the Revenue's demand to take out a licence and submit accounts was clear and overt and the Revenue could have taken action based thereon. The show cause notice, therefore, must be held to be beyond time.
3.  The only issue that then survives is that related to classification and that has been decided against the assessee by the judgment of this Court in Shree Baidyanath Ayurved Bhavan Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, Nagpur .
4.  The civil appeals succeed/ therefore, to the extent that the demands based on the show cause notice stand quashed. Refunds shall be available to the appellant consequent thereupon provided that the same are payable under the law.
No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
