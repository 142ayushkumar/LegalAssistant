B.C. Marula Siddappa and Others v Rudra Murthy and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14135/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The notice itself was issued limited on the question whether the High Court is right in setting aside the concurrent findings of two courts below without framing any substantial question of law as required under Section 100. It is not in dispute in the present case the High Court has not framed any substantial question of law nor decided.
2. Accordingly, the impugned order of the High Court dated 30th October, 1996 is unsustainable and the same is quashed. The case is remanded back to the High Court for deciding afresh after considering whether any substantial question of law arises or not and if it arises, must frame the same and dispose it of in accordance with law after giving opportunity to the parties to be heard.
3. With the said observation the present appeal is disposed of. Costs on the parties.
Appeal disposed of.
