Sita Ram Singhania v Bank Of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Limited And Others
Supreme Court of India

11  May  1999
Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 6759 of 1999 (From the judgment and order, Dt. 9.4.1999 in CMW.P. 15012/99 of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad).
The Order of the Court was has Follows :
1. We see no reason why the High Courts in such matters filed by the defendants in suits instituted by the banks before the Debt Recovery Tribunal should more or less as a matter of course grant stay of proceedings before the Tribunals. The very purpose of setting up the Tribunals will be lost by granting stay merely because there is challenge to the notification constitution the Tribunal. In the present case, the High Court has rightly come to the conclusion that as the proceedings were initiated in the State of Madhya Pradesh, the Allahabad High Court had no jurisdiction.
2. The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed
