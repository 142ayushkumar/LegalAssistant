1.  The appellant was convicted of offences under sections 417, 420 read with S. 511 and S. 471 read with S. 467 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment and fine for those offences.
2.  Having heard counsel for both sides we do not find any reason to disturb the order of conviction in respect of offences U/ss. 417 and 420 read with S. 511 but as regards the offence under S. 471 read with Section 467, Indian Penal Code, 1860 we do not think that the two certificates the appellant has been found to have forged to get admission in the Arts and Commerce College affiliated to Poona University could be described as "valuable security" as the expression is defined in S. 30 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
3. We, therefore, alter the conviction under the aforesaid sections to one under S. 471 read with S. 465 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
4.  However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case we set aside the sentences passed against the appellant and remit the matter to the trial court to consider, as provided in S. 6 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, whether the appellant should be given the benefit of S. 4 of the said Act. If the trial Court does not find it expedient to release the appellant on probation of good conduct under S. 4 of that Act, it should then pass proper sentences on the appellant for the offences of which the appellant has been found guilty. The fine imposed on the appellant, if paid, shall be refunded.
The appeal is disposed of as above.
Appeal allowed.
