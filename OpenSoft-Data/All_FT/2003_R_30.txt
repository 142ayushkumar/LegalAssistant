1.  The petitioner is the wife of the respondent who has filed Civil Suit No. 21A of 2002, in the Court of First Addl. District Judge, Raigarh, titled Suresh Chandra Das vs. Rachita Das, for divorce. The petitioner submits that she is living in Puri and it is impossible for her to defend the suit at Raigarh which is about 500 Kms. from Puri.

2. The respondent in his counter submits that he is an employee in a Bank and the requirements of his duty do not permit him to take leave too often for the pursue of his case.
