Umadevi v B.P. Sadhashivaiah and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16279/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant before us was a petitioner in a Civil Revision petition filed under Section 115 of C.P.C.
2.  The grievance made in the Civil Revision Petition was in relation to the order made in a suit on an Interlocutory Application filed under Order 1 Rule 10(2) C.P.C. seeking impleadment of a party in the suit on the ground that the last will dated 24.7.1981 was executed in applicant's favour by the deceased-defendant bequeathing her house property, which was described as plaint'B' schedule property.
3. The High Court dismissed the Revision Petition on the ground of the delay in filing of the revision. The explanation offered by the petitioner-applicant was not accepted by the High Court. Hence this appeal.
4.  We find from the explanation offered by the appellant that she was not aware of the order in the proceedings in the suit before the trial Court and after becoming aware she filed appropriate petition. That aspect should have been taken note of by the High Court while considering the Revision Petition and should have condoned the delay in filing the Revision petition.
5.  We set aside the order made by the High Court and remit the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration on merits. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
