D-Block Ashok Nagar (Sahibabad) Plot Holders Association (Re v State Of U.P. & Ors
Supreme Court of India

29 April 1997
Civil Appeal No. 3571 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment of the Allahabad High Court, Made one 6.5.1996 in CMWP No.13550/92.
2.  Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, the 'Act') acquiring a large chunk on land was published on June 26, 1982. The Special Land Acquisition Officer had given his award under Section 11 on February 27, 1989 granting compensation @ Rs. 50 and Rs.37.50 per sq.yd. It also granted solatium and interest under the Act as vL 1984 Amendment Act. That award was allowed to become final. The question is; whether the members of the appellant-Association are entitled to compensation? In view of the fact that the award has already become final, the stand taken by the Awash Evam Vikas Parishad that they are not liable to pay solatium under the amended Act and the claimants are entitled to get interest at 15% and 6% under the Schedule to the U.P Awash Evam Vikas Adhiniyam, cannot be countenanced.
3.  The Land Acquisition Officer has filed his counter affidavit. Therein, he has stated that for the land admeasuring 1157.895 acres, compensation in a sum of Rs.52, 05,94,187.90 was determined. Out of which Rs. 42,15,00,000/- was deposited and the balance amount was agreed to be deposited as admitted by the Teller dated December 10, 1992 of the Commissioner, Shri Rajiv Kumar Singh. The balance amount of Rs. 3,26,22,583,25 is, therefore, payable to them. The liability to pay interest arises only when the Land Acquisition Officer takes possession of the land after the award comes to be made. It is states on behalf of the Parishad that the possession of an extent of only 9.2 acres of land alone was delivered and the rest of the land has not been delivered and the rest of the land has not been delivered.
4. In view of the fact that the liability to pay the interest arises only free the date of taking possession and as it is claimed that the entire extent of the land has not been given possession, the Land Acquisition Officer is directed to determine as to what extent of the area possession of which has been given after the award; for those claimants whose lands have been taken possession, interest shall be calculated as per the award from the date of taking possession till date of deposit and interest shall accordingly be deposited within a period of six months from the date of the receipt of the judgment. The appeal is accordingly allowed. No costs.
Appeal allowed
