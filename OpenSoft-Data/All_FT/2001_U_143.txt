Union of India and Others v Kamaljit Kaur and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3882/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We do not find any scope for entertaining this SLP as the same has become infructuous in view of the subsequent actions taken by the petitioners in paying the amoount directly to the claimant. This is what learned senior counsel for the petitioner-UOI submitted before us.
It seems the only grievance is that the payment has been accepted by the claimant during the pendency of another appeal without adequate security.
2. It is for the petitioner to move the court concerned for giving the appropriate directions to the person who received the amount to furnish adequate security. Without prejudice to that right we dispose of this SLP.
Petition disposed of.
