2.  The Compensation Tribunal awarded compensation at rate of Rs. 950 per acre, which worked out at Rs. 12,604 and 15 per cent solatium for compulsory acquisition which amounted to Rs.1896.70. The total compensation, therefore was Rs.14,541.20.

We maintain 15 per cent for compulsory acquisition but raise interest to 9 per cent on the enhanced compensation from today till payment. We leave it open for the appellant to move for higher interest and solatium if entitled by virtue of subsequent pronouncement of this Court in any.
4.  In the result, this appeal is allowed as above. We make no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
