State of Uttar Pradesh and Others v Justice Nand Lal Ganguly(Retd.)
Supreme Court of India

5 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12466/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Equity reforms and moderates rigour hardness and edge of the law. It has "not passed the age of child bearing". It appears that these principles influenced the High Court in deciding the petition in favour of the respondent.
2.  It is not disputed before us that so far as other conditions of service of the respondent are concerned, he has been given the benefit of guidelines issued by the Union of India on 8th October, 1987 through the Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs, which guidelines were adopted by the State Government on 2nd December, 1988 and those are in tune with the status of a High Court Judge (Retired).
3. Keeping in view all these factors and the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order.
The special leave petition therefore fails and is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
