Ramdas Penter v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2003
Cr.A. No.307 Of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These two appeals are interlinked and are against a common judgment of the Bombay High Court. Four persons were put on trial for the alleged offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short "the IPC") and Section 324 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860. The accusations were that over a very trivial issue on 10.10.1980, the accused persons in furtherance of their common intention caused death of one Ramesh Maruti Sheller (hereinafter referred to as the deceased). It was also alleged that when PW 2 tried to intervene he was assaulted on his leg. The trial court found each of the accused persons guilty and convicted them for offences relatable to Section 302 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 imposing sentence of imprisonment for life and under Section 324 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 18 months. Three of them preferred appeals before the High Court and A-4 (Don Shaikh Ibrahim) did not prefer any appeal. The appeal before the High Court did not bring any relief to the appellants. Hence this appeal. The special leave petition so far as Ramesh Bhagwan Manjrekar was also dismissed by order of this Court dated 9.12.1996.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
2.  In support of the appeal, Ms. Kamini Jaiswal, learned counsel for the appellants, submitted that that the roles attributed to A-2 and A-3 do not bring out the accusations as levelled against them. Further the medical evidence rules out any participation so far as they are concerned. In any event, Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 cannot be applied in their case in the absence of the necessary ingredients being established.
3.  Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-State of Maharashtra submitted that the conduct of the accused persons prior to the occurrence and after the stabbing by A-1 clearly shows that they had shared the common intention.
4.  On an analysis of the evidence on record we find that though A-2 and A-3 came along with the actual assailant i.e. 
A-1, their role during the occurrence does not clearly bring out the common intention to commit murder. Drawing an inference of common intention would depend upon the facts of the particular case and no generalised rule of universal application can be laid down. That being so, we are of the view that A-2 and A-3 cannot be roped in for the offence relatable to Section 302 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860.
5. However, their conduct during the occurrence, before the occurrence and post occurrence clearly brings out that they had shared the common intention of causing injury to PW 2 and attracts offence relatable to Section 326 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860.
6.  On the facts and circumstances of the case, we alter their conviction from Section 302 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860 to Section 326 read with Section 34 Indian Penal Code, 1860. For the said conviction their custodial sentence of three years would meet the ends of justice. They shall surrender to custody to serve of remainder sentence, if any. The appeals are allowed to the extent indicated above.
Appeals partly allowed.
