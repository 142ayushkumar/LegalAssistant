Yaniv Cohen v State of Goa
Supreme Court of India

29 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3807/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.
1.  Application filed by the petitioner for releasing him on bail under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short the "Cr.P.C.") does not call for any interference.
2.  However, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner has filed an application under Section 167(2) Cr.P.C. for releasing him on bail and that he has not filed an application for releasing him on bail under Section 439, Cr.P.C.
Therefore, if the petitioner files a fresh application for releasing him on bail, it may be decided on merits. Considering the fact that the petitioner has filed the application for bail under Section 167(2), Cr.P.C., it would be open to the petitioner to file fresh application under Section 439, Cr.P.C. and the Court would decide the same in accordance with law.
This Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
