1.  This appeal arises out of a suit filed in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Kozhikode, for refund of price of an ice-manufacturing plant and for damages. The claim was valued in the plaint at Rs. 17, 488-4-6 - Rs. 16, 488-4-6 being the value of the ice plant and Rs. 1, 000/- being the amount of damages. The Trial Court decreed the suit and awarded to the plaintiff the value of the ice plant and Rs. 13, 110-0-0 as damages.
2. In appeal to the High Court the decree of the Trial Court was reversed and the plaintiff's suit was dismissed. The High Court was then persuaded to grant a certificate for leave to appeal to this Court u/art. 133(1)(a) of the Constitution.
3.  The appeal, in our judgment, is incompetent. By the judgment under appeal the decree of the Court of First Instance was reversed, but the condition for granting a certificate is that the amount or value of the subject-matter of the dispute in the Court of First Instance and still in dispute on appeal was and is not less than Rs. 20, 000/-. The value of the subject-matter of the dispute in the Court of First Instance was Rs. 17, 488-4-6 and no more. The fact that the Trial Court granted a decree for the amount exceeding Rs. 20, 000/- will not attract the application of Art. 133(1)(a) of the Constitution.
4. In our judgment the High Court had no jurisdiction to grant a certificate u/art. 133(1)(a). The certificate being incompetently issued we have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
5.  The appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
