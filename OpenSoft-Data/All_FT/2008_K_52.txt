R. Leela Bhai v K.R. Valsala Devi & Ors
Supreme Court of India

29 January 2008
Appeal (civil) 6734 of 2003 WITH C.A.No.4181/2006 AND C.A. NOS.917,916 and 915 of 2008 ARISING OUT OF SLP(C) NOS.25202/2005, 5723/2006 AND 2703/2007
The Order of the Court was as follows :
C.A.Nos.6734/2003 and 4181/2006
1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the appellants at great length, we see no reason to interfere. The appeals being devoid of merit are accordingly dismissed. Civil Appeal Nos.917, 916 and 915 of 2008 SLP(C) Nos.25202/2005, 5723/2006 and 2703/2007
Leave granted.
2.  Heard the learned counsel for the appellants at great length. The appellant has challenged the advertisement dated 26.10.1999 before the High Court. The learned Single Judge dismissed the petition on the ground of laches. The appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court met with the same fate. Hence these appeals. In the advertisement the qualification prescribed for the post of Cashier-cum- Clerk in the District Co-operative Societies is B.A./B.Sc./B.Com with HDC or JDC or C.Com with Co-operation or B.Sc. (Co-operation and Banking) of the Kerala Agricultural University. It is the contention of the counsel that in the relevant service rules the qualification prescribed is S.S.L.C. with J.D.C. and three years experience in the affiliated Primary Co-operative Society. According to the counsel the qualification prescribed in the Advertisement is contrary to the qualification prescribed in the service rules and discriminatory.
3.  We see no substance in the contention. Since, the advertisement has been issued for all the candidates; we do not see any substance in the contention of the appellant that he has been thereby discriminated. We see nothing wrong in prescribing higher qualification in the advertisement.
These appeals being devoid of merit are accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed
