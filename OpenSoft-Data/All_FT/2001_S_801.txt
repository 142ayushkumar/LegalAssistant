Menaka v State of Karnataka and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15260/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel contends that as a matter of fact publication of the declaration under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') was made only after the lapse of one year from the date of publication of the Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act.
2.  The factual premise itself was not accepted by the courts below. Even if the contention of Ms. Kiran Suri, learned counsel for the petitioner is to be adopted the Special Leave Petition cannot survive because of the four Judge Bench decision of this Court in Khadim Hussain vs. State of U.P. and others. The declaration under Section 6 need be made within one year.
3. There is no dispute that the declaration was made within one year of the date of publication of Section 4(1) Notification. Any publication of the declaration is treated only as an evidence of the declaration made under Section 6, as per the aforecited decision.
4.  In view of the settled legal position as stated above it is unnecessary for recanvassing the same. Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
