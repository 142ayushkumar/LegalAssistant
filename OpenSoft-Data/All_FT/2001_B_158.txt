Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 3318/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that other convicted persons who played a role equal to that of the petitioner, according to the prosecution version, are now benefited by an order of suspension of sentence granted by the High Court.
2.  On a perusal of the allegations which the Sessions Judge found to be true we are disinclined to suspend the sentence passed on the petitioner even if it is correct that the co-accused who played similar role got the benefit.
Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition Dismissed.
