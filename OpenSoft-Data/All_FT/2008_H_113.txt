Brawn Pharmaceuticals Limited v Hukum Singh and Sons and others
Supreme Court of India

27 November 2008
C.A. No(s). 6683 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This case raises an important question, namely, whether in the bills submitted by the supplier to the purchaser, a printed clause stating that 'in case of any dispute in respect of this bill, the same shall be referred to the Paper Merchants Association for sole arbitration and the judgment given by the arbitrator/arbitrators appointed by the executive committee shall be final and binding' would constitute an arbitration agreement under the Arbitration Act, 1940 and would entitle the supplier, without anything more, and whether or not the bills are initialed by the purchaser, to unilaterally refer any dispute pertaining to those bills for arbitration.
2.  In our opinion, this is an important question having wider implications and, hence, it needs to be decided by a larger Bench of this Court.
3.  Let the papers of this case be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for reference to a larger Bench.
Order accordingly.
