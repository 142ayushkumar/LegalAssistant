Pratul Kumar Sinha v State of West Bengal and Others
Supreme Court of India

19 August 1991
W.P. (Criminal) No. 1146 of 1991
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution and is filed by way of public interest litigation. A grievance is made regarding ragging in the I.I.T., Kharagpur. It is alleged that one student was thrown from the second floor and had sustained fractures of ribs and had been badly injured. The atmosphere within the Institute has been very much disturbed on that account. If we entertain this petition here, it will be difficult for the parties to come over to Delhi and file their affidavits.
2.  On the other hand keeping the proximity of the Institute from the Calcutta High Court in consideration we think it appropriate to transfer this petition. This petition is transferred to the Calcutta High Court to be treated as one under Article 226 of the Constitution. Notice may be issued for disposal on merit and the matter be taken up as early as possible and preferably the case may be closed within four months from the time respondents appear. Respondent 4 may be deleted from the array of respondents.
Order accordingly.
