Whirlpool of India Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

1 February 2000
Tax Ref. Case No. 6 of 1996
The Judgment was delivered by: KIRPAL, J.
1.  The question involved in this reference relates to the allowability of the deduction of Rs. 1,40,86,821 claimed by the appellant for the asst. yr. 1986-87 under s. 43B of the IT Act.
2.  The ITO had disallowed this deduction for the year 1986-87 but had, allowed it for the subsequent asst. yr. 1987-88. Similarly, in respect of asst. yr. 1987-88, the ITO had disallowed another amount of Rs. 1, 25, 30, 853 claimed under s. 43B but in appeal the Tribunal has allowed this deduction. The effect of the order of the Tribunal is that in respect of the asst. yr. 1987-88 the appellant has got a deduction of Rs. 1,40,86,821, which was allowed by the ITO, plus further deduction of Rs. 1,25,30,853 as a result of the order of the Tribunal.
3. In view of the decision of this Court in Allied Motors (P) Ltd. vs. CIT 1997 Indlaw SC 26001997 Indlaw SC 2600 in respect of the amount of Rs. 1,40,86,821 the deduction was allowable for the asst. yr. 1986-87, as claimed by the appellant before the ITO. In this view of the matter the question of law which was referred by the Tribunal has to be answered in favour of the appellant which would mean that for the asst. yr. 1986-87 deduction under s. 43B would be allowed for the sum of Rs. 1,40,86,821.
4.  An affidavit has been filed by Shri Dinesh Mittal on behalf of the appellant in which it is stated that inasmuch as in respect of the asst. yr. 1986-87, the ITO has to pass a fresh assessment order to give effect to the order of the Tribunal allowing the deduction of Rs. 1,25,30,853. For that year, the appellant itself will suo motu request the AO to withdraw the deduction of Rs. 1, 40, 86, 821 which had been allowed in the year 1987-88 and to allow the deduction of the said amount in the year 1986-87.
5.  In order that there may not be any technical difficulty subsequently, and keeping in view the said affidavit filed on behalf of the appellant in this Court, we direct under Art. 142 of the Constitution that in respect of the asst. yr. 1987-88 when the ITO is giving effect to the order of the Tribunal he shall, while allowing the deduction of Rs. 1,23,30,853-for that year, disallow the deduction of Rs. 1,40,86,821. The ultimate result will be that the deduction of this latter amount will be allowed in the asst. yr. 1986-87 and not in the asst. yr. 1987-88. The question of law referred in this tax reference is answered in favour of the appellant. No costs.
Order accordingly.
