Union of India and Others v B.N. Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 December 1995
Civil Appeal No. 12075 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  We have called for the record to satisfy ourselves whether the Tribunal was justified in giving the direction in the impugned order. On perusal of the record, it is seen that except during the relevant period, either previous or subsequent to the period, the first respondent has outstanding career and the records are very good. The integrity of the officer has not been doubted. Under these circumstances, we think that it is not a case warranting our interference under Article 136 of theConstitution.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
