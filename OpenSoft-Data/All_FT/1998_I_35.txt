C.As. Nos. 1720-21 of 1990
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  We have considered the order made in Civil Appeals Nos. 1720-21 of 1990.
2. The judgment in Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board v. A. Rajappa 1978 Indlaw SC 2601978 Indlaw SC 260 was delivered almost two decades ago and the law has since been amended pursuant to that judgment though the date of enforcement of the amendment has not been notified.
3.  The judgment delivered by seven learned Judges of this Court in Bangalore Water Supply case (supra) does not, in our opinion, require any reconsideration on a reference being made by a two-Judge Bench of this Court, which is bound by the judgment of the larger Bench.
4.  The appeals shall, therefore, be listed before the appropriate Bench for further proceedings.
Order accordingly.
