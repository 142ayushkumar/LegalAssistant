Commissioner of Income Tax v Rajaram Maize Products
Supreme Court of India

23 August 2001
C.A. Nos. 2006 (From judgment and order Dt. 1 October 1997 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in IT Ref. No. 4 of 1995, reported as CIT vs. Rajaram Maize Products 1998 144 CTR (MP) 267 : 1998 234 ITR 667 (MP) : TC S13.1361), 2004, 2005, 3462 & 3560 of 1998 & 5677 of 2001.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted in the special leave petition.
The question that requires our consideration reads thus:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding that the power subsidy received by the assessee was a capital receipt not liable to be taxed within the meaning of s. 28(iv) of the IT Act, 1961 ?"
1.  This Court in Sahney Steel & Press Works Ltd. & Ors. vs. CIT 1997 Indlaw SC 15271997 Indlaw SC 1527has held that power subsidies are of revenue nature and have to be taxed accordingly.
2. We also find that the terms under which the subsidy was given in the present cases clearly suggest that the subsidy was of a revenue nature inasmuch as it went towards reduction of the electricity bills.
3.  Accordingly the appeals are allowed. The orders under challenge are set aside insofar as they relate to the question quoted above. That question is answered in the negative and in favour of the Revenue.
No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
