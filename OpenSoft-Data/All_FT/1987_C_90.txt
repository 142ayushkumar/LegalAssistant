Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras v T. N. K. Govinda Raju Chetty
Supreme Court of India

12 February 1987
C.A. No. 299 and 300 of 1974
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The only question in these appeals is whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that the income from interest which had accrued to the respondent on the compensation payable to him in view of the acquisition of land belonging to him for the assessment years 1955-56 and 1956-57 should be spread over the respective years to the extent to which it could be deemed to have accrued in those years.
2.   We have considered the matter carefully and we think that having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the fact that the mercantile system of account was the basis on which the interest income accrued, the High Court was right in answering the question in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue.
3.  The appeals are, therefore, dismissed. In the circumstances, there is no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
