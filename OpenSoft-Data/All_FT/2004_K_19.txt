Supreme Court of India

28 July 2004
C.As. No. 6520 of 2003 with Nos. 6521-38 of 2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
IA No. 3 in CA No. 6520 of 2003:
1.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and considering the purpose for which this IA is made, we permit the State of Karnataka to carry on Dr. S. Roerich Centenary Celebrations till the end of December, 2004 on the premises in question.
2.  The State Government is also permitted to take out paintings and other artefacts from Venkatappa Art Gallery to the place of celebrations i.e. the premises in question. We make it clear that after the celebrations are over, they shall bring them back to the Venkatappa Gallery.
3.  This order is without prejudice to the rights and contentions of both the parties as to the possession over the property in question.
IA No. 3 is disposed of accordingly.
CAs Nos. 6520, 6521-37 and 6538 of 2003:
4.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties for some time, we are of the view that the following substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution of India arise in these appeals:
5.  Whether Section 110 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961, as amended by the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1973 (1 of 1974), which came into effect from 1-3-1974, read with Section 79-B of the said Act, introduced by amending Act 1 of 1974, violates the basic structure of the Constitution, insofar as it confers power on the executive Government, a delegatee of the legislature, of withdrawal of exemption of linaloe plantation, without hearing and without reasons?
6.  Whether the Roerich and Devikarani Roerich Estate (Acquisition and Transfer) Act, 1996 (the Acquisition Act) is protected by Article 31-C of the Constitution?
7.  Whether on true interpretation of Article 300-A of the Constitution, the said Act is violative of the said article insofar as no specific compensation is prescribed for the acquisition of 468 acres of linaloe plantation, and, after deduction of liabilities and payment of compensation for the artefacts, no balance may and/or is likely to exist for payment of such compensation, as a result of which, whether the Act really is expropriatory in nature?
8.  Whether on true interpretation of Article 300-A of the Constitution, the said Act is violative of Article 300-A as the said article is not, by itself, a source of legislative power, but such power of the State Legislature being traceable only to Schedule VII List III Entry 42 to the Constitution viz. "Acquisition and requisitioning of property", which topic excludes expropriation and confiscation of property?
9.  If Article 300-A of the Constitution is construed as providing for deprivation of property without any compensation at all, or illusory compensation, and hence providing for expropriation and confiscation of property, whether the said article would violate the rule of law and would be an arbitrary and unconscionable violation of Article 14 of the Constitution, thus violating the basic structure of the Constitution?
10.  In this view, having regard to Article 145(3) of the Constitution, place the papers before the Hon'ble Chief Justice for referring the matters to a Constitution Bench.
IA No. 4 in CA No. 6520 of 2003:
To be heard along with the appeals.
Order accordingly.
