Union of India v V. B. Raju
Supreme Court of India

29 March 1982
C.A. No. 2151 of 1972.
The Judgment was delivered by: CHINNAPPA REDDY, J.
The respondent Shri V.B. Raju, was a member of the Indian Civil Service and was a Judge first of the Bombay High Court and later of the Gujarat High Court. He was a Judge from June 12, 1959 to February 10, 1969 on which date he retired, He filed a writ petition in the Gujarat High Court claiming that he was entitled to be paid a pension of pounds 1000 sterling in addition to the additional pension payable under Part II of the First Schedule to the High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1954 1974 Indlaw SC 1261974 Indlaw SC 1261974 Indlaw SC 1261974 Indlaw SC 126. In view of the judgment of this Court in V.B. Raju v. State of Gujarat 1974 Indlaw SC 1261974 Indlaw SC 1261974 Indlaw SC 1261974 Indlaw SC 126, this appeal has to be allowed. It was however, argued by Shri V.B. Raju, in the case now before us, that in the earlier judgment of the Supreme Court there was no reference to the High Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1954
Shri Raju raised a preliminary objection that in view of Article 312-A(3) of the Constitution which came into force w.e.f. August 29, 1972 the present appeal by the Union of India was not maintainable. We see no force in the submission. The action out of which the appeal arises was instituted prior to August 29, 1972 and the Union of India had a vested right of appeal vide Garikapatti Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhury 1957 Indlaw SC 1601957 Indlaw SC 1601957 Indlaw SC 160.
1. The appeal is therefore allowed, and the writ petition in the High Court is dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
