Kamla Shankar v Director of Board of Technical Education, Kanpur and Another
Supreme Court of India

31 March 1995
Appeal (Civil) 4597 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
Heard both the counsel.
1.  This Court, on January 12, 1986 in similar circumstances, directed the Government to declare the result of the Fourth Year Diploma Course Examination taken by one Ramesh, appellant therein, and it was undertaken by him that if he succeeds in passing the examination, he may be entitled to that benefit and in case he failed, he will not file any Writ Petition in the High Court questioning the result of the examination. The appellant herein also seeks the same relief.
2.  It would appear that pending Writ Petition before High Court the appellant obtained orders to appear for the 4th year examination, but the result has not been declared. If the records are still available after passing the examinations, the respondents are directed to declare the result of the examination. If the appellant passes in the examination, then it would be open to the respondents to grant diploma certificate according to rules and subject to fulfillment, other conditions, if any. If the appellant does not pass in the examination, that is the end of the matter. He shall not be eligible to question the action of the respondents by filing any further writ petition in the High Court.
The appeal is accordingly disposed of. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
