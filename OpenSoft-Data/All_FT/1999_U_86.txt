Indian Council For Enviro-Legal Action v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 March 1999
W.P. (C) No. 664 of 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In pursuance of the judgment passed by this Court on 18-4-1996 Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India, 1996 Indlaw SC 1074, the Central Government has constituted the central authority by its notification dated 26-11-1998.
2.  Mr. M. C. Mehta, who is appearing in person drew our attention to the need for representation of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the national authorities and the authorities which have also been constituted by the coastal States by separate notifications issued on that date. It is pointed out by Mr Altaf Ahmed, learned Additional Solicitor General that Father Thomas Kocherry at Serial No. 8 in the central authority represents a non-governmental organisation.
3. That may be so, but we do not understand why 3 persons, namely, Shri Bal Mane, Shri Shiva Kashinath Naik and Shri Rajaram Gadhekar at Serial Nos. 9 to 11, though not specialists, have been inducted in the central authority, as all of them are from the State of Maharashtra. One from the State of Maharashtra is understandable, but why the other two persons have been inducted in the national authority is not understandable, as in their place some other States could have been represented. The learned Additional Solicitor General shall obtain instructions within two weeks as to whether it would be possible to induct people from other coastal States in the national authority in place of at least two persons from the State of Maharashtra.
The notifications shall be placed on the records.
List after 2 weeks.
Order accordingly.
