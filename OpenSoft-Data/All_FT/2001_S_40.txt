Menon Abdul Hameed Moosa v S. Venkatasawamy
Supreme Court of India

23 March 2001
I.A.No.1 in Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4448/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Heard petitioner-in-person and learned counsel for the respondent. The petitioner-in-person filed an application for modifying the order of this Court dated 27.9.2001 for extending time to vacate the premises in question which is expiring on 31.3.2001. He seeks further time till 30.4.2002. We do not find it an appropriate case for granting any further time till April 30, 2002.
2. However, as a last indulgence to the petitioner we modify the said order and extend time to vacate the premises by or before 30.6.2001 subject to the filing of the usual undertaking in this Court within four weeks from today. We make it clear that no further indulgence will be granted in the matter. I.A. No.1 is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
