Vajja Srinivasu Alias Srinu v State of Andhra Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

4 September 2000
Cr.A. No. 746 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal has been confined to the quantum of sentence. The conviction of the appellant is under Section 20(b)(i) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short "the NDPS Act"). The maximum punishment prescribed there under is rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years and a fine which may extend to Rs. 50, 000. But the trial court has imposed imprisonment for a term of two years and a fine of Rs. 3000.
2.  Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant was aged 21 years when the court framed charge against him. As the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act are inapplicable to the offences under the NDPS Act, the appellant is disabled from pleading for application of the beneficial provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act. Learned counsel submits that the said disability will not preclude him from pleading for a lesser sentence particularly in view of the age factor.
3.  Considering all aspects and the fact situation of this case, we think that a sentence of imprisonment of one year will be sufficient to meet the ends of justice.
4. We, therefore, reduce the sentence to rigorous imprisonment for one year. The fine part of the sentence will remain undisturbed. But the default in payment of fine will ensure a further period of imprisonment for three months.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
