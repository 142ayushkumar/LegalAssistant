Commissioner of Wealth Tax v T. S. Santhanam (HUF) and Others
Supreme Court of India

31 January 2001
C.A. Nos. 8499 to 8506 of 1995
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  The assessee has been served but has not chosen to put in an appearance.
2.  The question before the High Court at the behest of the Revenue read thus:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that for purposes of computation of the intrinsic value of unquoted shares under r. 1D of the WT Rules, the amount of advance tax paid by the company and shown on the asset aside of the balance sheet should not be deducted from the tax payable in determining whether the provision for tax was in excess over the tax payable with reference to the book profits in accordance with the law applicable thereto within the meaning of cl. (ii)(e) of the Explanation to the said rule ?"
3.  The High Court answered the question in favour of the assessee relying upon the decision in L. G. Balakrishnan and Ors. vs. CWT 1988 Indlaw MAD 80: 1988 Indlaw MAD 80.
That decision is no longer good law. The question is now governed by the decision of this Court in Bharat Hari Singhania vs. CWT 1994 Indlaw SC 1335: 1994 Indlaw SC 1335.
4.  The civil appeals are, therefore, allowed and the question is answered in favour of the Revenue.
No order as to costs.
Appeals allowed.
