Bashishth Singh and Anr v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 235/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Appellants are involved in a case for which there is a cross case (or counter case as it can be called).
2.  The case against the appellants is based on the FIR lodged by the complainant Ram Narain Singh. The counter case was built up on the strength of the FIR lodged by the 2nd appellant.
3. Both the cases were investigated but only in one case final report has been laid. Whatever be the position, we feel that this is a case where appellants can be let on bail during the trial period.
4.  We, therefore, order the appellants to be released on the bail on each of them executing a bond in a sum of Rs.25,000/- with solvent surities to the satisfaction of the Sessions Judge, Kaimur.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
