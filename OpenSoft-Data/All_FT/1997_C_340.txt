Ess Ess Kay Engineering Company P. Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

23 July 1997
C.A. No. 2577 of 1982 (Arising as an appeal from the judgment and order Dt. 1 June 1981, of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in I.T.R. No. 91 of 1976).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is a case of reopening. We have perused the documents. We find there was material on the basis of which the Income-tax Officer could proceed to reopen the case, it is not a case of mere change of opinion.
2. We are not inclined to interfere with the decision of the High Court merely because the case of the assessee was accepted as correct in the original assessment for this assessment year. It does not preclude the Income-tax Officer to reopen the assessment of an earlier year on the basis of his findings of fact made on the basis of fresh materials in the course of assessment of the next assessment year.
3. The appeal is dismissed. No order as to costs.
Appeal Dismissed.
