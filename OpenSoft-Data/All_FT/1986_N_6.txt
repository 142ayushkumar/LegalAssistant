Smt. Navabai Laxman Jadhav and Others v Namdeo Jijaba Gaikwad and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 December 1986
C.A. No. 4435 of 1986 (Arising out of S.L.P. No. 1317 of 1986).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we feel that the High Court was not justified in dismissing the writ petition u/art. 226 of the Constitution on the ground of laches. There was no inordinate or unexplained delay on the part of the appellants in filing the writ petition.
2. The delay, if any, was on the part of the State Government in disposing of the application for review and therefore could not be a reason for dismissing the writ petition on the ground of laches. The writ petition does not questions which merited hearing on merits.
3.  We accordingly grant leave, set aside the judgment and order of the High Court and remit the writ petition for hearing on merits after notice to parties.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly with no costs.
Appeal disposed of.
