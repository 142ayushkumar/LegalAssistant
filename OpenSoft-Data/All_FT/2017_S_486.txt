1. Leave granted.
2. It is informed that out of ten years of sentence, the appellant has served more than seven years in jail. It is also informed that the co-accused has been released on bail.
3. While issuing notice on 28.08.2017, this Court passed the following order :-
"Delay condoned.
The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that Accused No. 2, who is exactly similarly placed as the petitioner, has been granted bail, whereas the petitioner has been denied bail.
In view of the above submission, issue notice, returnable in four weeks."
4. The learned counsel for the State submits that the High Court is taking steps to expedite the hearing, but the fact remains is that, the appellant is similarly placed as the co-accused.
5. Having already served more than seven years, out of ten years of sentence, we are of the view that the appellant also needs to be enlarged on bail, if not required to be detained in any other case.
6. Therefore, the appellant is enlarged on bail on his furnishing bail bonds to the tune of Rs. 25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) with two solvent sureties of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.
7. In view of the above, this appeal is disposed of.
Appeal disposed of
