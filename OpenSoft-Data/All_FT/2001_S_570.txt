Arjun Jha and Anr v State of Bihar
Supreme Court of India

4  May  2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Though we were not persuaded by the initial argument of learned counsel, he addressed alternative arguments as follows:- If death had been caused to the victims as a result of the gun-shot injuries fired by the petitioners it would not amount to murder, but only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. If that be so, the offence would have been lowered to Section 308 Indian Penal Code, 1860 as the maximum, if not Section 324 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
2. In the event of the conviction being altered to Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, no court could have awarded a sentence of imprisonment for five years, as has been done in this case.
3.  But the second limb of Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 indicates a maximum sentence awardable is seven years if hurt is caused to the victim. In the present case gun-shot injuries had been caused to the victims.
4.  Therefore there is no such illegality in awarding a sentence of imprisonment for five years. Hence we are not inclined to interfere.
The SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
