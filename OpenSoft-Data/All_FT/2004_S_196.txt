Ghaziabad Development Authority v Sisir K. Mund
Supreme Court of India

7 July 2004
C.A. No. 2692 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These two appeals are directed against the order passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as the National commission') to the extent each party is aggrieved. The appellant - Ghaziabad Development Authority ('GDA' for short) in C.A.No. 2692/ 99 is aggrieved by the direction given in the impugned order to pay compensation of Rs. 1 lakh to the respondent in the said appeal.
2. The appellant in C.A. No. 2693/99, Sisir Kumar Mund (respondent in C.A. No. 2692/ 99), is aggrieved by the order of the National Commission in not awarding interest @ 18% per annum for the period from the date of deposit of the amount till the delivery of possession of the flat to him. The State Commission for Redressal of Consumer disputes, UP, Lucknow.
3.  Referred to as the 'State Commission' directed the GDA to pay interest on the sum of Rs. 4,14,000/- to the complainant with effect from 1.7.1994 till the date of actual possession of the flat was given to him. Now we are told that the possession of the flat has been delivered to him on 22.7.1998. The State Commission also directed to pay a sum of Rs, . 10,000/- towards harassment and mental torture to the complainant. The State Commission, in its order, stated that if the said amount is not paid within a specified period, that amount shall carry interest @ 18%. The GDA questioned the validity and correctness of the order passed by the State Commission. The State Commission passed the impugned order.
4.  Having heard learned counsel for the parties on either side and looking to the facts and circumstances of the case and also taking note of the fact that the possession of the flat has already been handed over to the complainant on 22.7.1998, we think it is just and appropriate to modify the impugned order.
5.  Accordingly, in modification of the impugned order we pass the following order:
i) The GDA shall pay interest on the sum of Rs. 4,14,000/- from 1.7.1994 till 22.7.1998 @ 12% per annum.
ii) This amount shall be paid to the complainant, i.e., the appellant in C.A. No. 2693 of 1999 within a period of eight weeks from today.
6.  Both the appeals are disposed of in the above terms. No costs.
Appeals disposed of.
