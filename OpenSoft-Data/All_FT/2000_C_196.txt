Commissioner of Income Tax v Laxmi Wine Merchants
Supreme Court of India

6 December 2000
C.As. Nos. 4158 to 4164 of 1994 (Appeals by special leave from the judgments and orders of the Andhra Pradesh High Court Dt. 18 December 1989, in I.T.C. No. 176 of 1989 and Dt. 26 December 1989, in I.T.C. Nos. 233, 234, 236, 237, 239 and 240 of 1989).
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  The High Court declined to call for a reference of the following question:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal is justified in holding that the assessee was entitled to the benefits of registration in spite of contravention of rules 38 and 39 of the A.P. Foreign Liquor and Indian Liquor Rules, 1970 ?"
2.  It did so because of an earlier decision in CIT v. Nalli Venkataramana 1983 Indlaw AP 48. The Revenue is, therefore, in appeal by special leave. The decision of the High Court in the case of Nalli Venkataramana 1983 Indlaw AP 48 was considered by this court in Bihari Lal Jaiswal v. CIT 1995 Indlaw SC 646 and was found unacceptable. It is, therefore, clear that a question of law does arise which requires the consideration of the High Court, in the light of the judgment of this court in the case of Bihari Lal Jaiswal 1995 Indlaw SC 646.
3.  The civil appeals are allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The Tribunal shall refer to the High Court the question aforestated, having drawn up a statement of case. No order as to costs.
Appeals Allowed.
