Udai Kant Jha v Union Of India
Supreme Court of India

3 December 1999
Cr.A. No. 1304 of 1999, Dt. 3 December 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We are told that appellant in this case has already undergone imprisonment for nearly five months. The offence is under Sec. 135 for the Customs Act on the allegation that he was found in possession of 48 wrist watches costing about Rs. 22,000/-. Incident happened on 1st January, 1976. We do not think it necessary to confirm the sentence of one year imposed on him due to this distance of time and also due to the broad aspect involved in this case including the value of the contraband seized from him.
2. We, therefore, reduce the sentence to the period of imprisonment which appellant has already undergone.
The Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
