Sube Singh and Others v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

22 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.585/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  One of the contentions raised in the present case pertains to the validity of the order dated 23rd February, 2001 whereby the appellant who had been placed under suspension in the year 2000 was dismissed from service.
2.  It is an admitted case that no inquiry was held against the appellant even though in the order placing him under suspension the reasons for doing so were mentioned.
Presumably, the appellant was placed under suspension in contemplation of disciplinary action which must have been proposed against him.
3. But no inquiry was held and the appellant was dismissed from service in the year 2001, even though he had been appointed over 18 years earlier, that is to say, in the year 1982.
4.  Without going into the other aspects of the case, namely, the validity of the order of the State Government reinstating respondent No. 5, the allegation being that such an order was arbitrary, only on the ground that principles of natural justice have been violated, we allow this appeal and set aside the order of dismissal of the appellant.
5. All the other questions and issues involved in this case are left open.
Appeal allowed.
