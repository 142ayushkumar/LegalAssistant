State of Uttar Pradesh v Chhotey Lal Pandey and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 August 1987
C.A. No. 577 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We think, it is really unnecessary to go into the merits of this appeal.
2. The orders of the Government of Uttar Pradesh identifying the backward classes for recruitment of posts of Munsifs were struck down on the ground that the backward classes had not been properly identified.
3. We are told that subsequently another Commission had been appointed to go into that question and the Commission has submitted a report and it is stated to be under the consideration of the State Government.
4. We, therefore, do not think it necessary to go into the merits of the appeal. The appeal is therefore dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
