State of Punjab v Raj Kumar
Supreme Court of India

7 October 1991
S.L.P. (Criminal) No. of 1991 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 2 March 1990 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Cr. Misc. No. 289-M(A) of 1989) with Cri. Misc. Petition No. 7948 of 1991
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this matter there is a gross delay without any justification. The application for condonation of delay mechanically recites that the delay was
"due to the exchange of the correspondence between the different departments of the State and the advocate for the petitioner regarding the swearing of the affidavit etc, by the concerned officer."
Not a single detail regarding the correspondence is given. The only purpose of filing this special leave petition and the application for condonation of delay apparently seems to be to make a show that an attempt was made to challenge the impugned order and the attempt was deferred by the Court. Such application only leads to waste of public money. Application for condonation of delay is rejected.
2.  The special leave petition is dismissed as barred by limitation. Copy of this order to be sent to the Home Secretary as well as to the Chief Secretary of the State of Punjab and the Advocate-General for the State for information.
Petition dismissed.
