Cement Marketing Company of India Limited v Commissioner of Commercial Axes, Karnataka
Supreme Court of India

30 October 1979
C.A. No. 2635 of 1977
The Judgment was delivered by: P. N. Bhagwati, J.
1.  This appeal by special leave raises the question whether in respect of transactions of sale of cement effected by the appellant under the provisions of the Cement Control Order, the amount of freight formed part of the "sale price" within the meaning of the definition of that term in S. 2(h) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 and was includible in the taxable turnover of the appellant.
2.  This question is no longer res integra and it stands concluded by a recent decision given by this Court in Hindustan Sugar Mills v. State of Rajasthan 1978 Indlaw SC 292. It has been held by this Court in that case that by reason of the provisions of the Cement Control Order which governed the transactions of sale of cement entered into by the assessee with the purchasers, the amount of freight formed part of the "sale price" within the meaning of the first part of the definition of that term in S. 2(h) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 and was includible in the turnover of the assessee. This decision completely covers the present case and hence we must hold that the High Court was right in taking the view that the amount of freight formed part of the sale price and was rightly included in the taxable turnover of the appellant.
3.  We may point out that the observations made by this Court in the order dated August 31, 1979, allowing the review application of the assessee in Hindustan Sugar Mills v. State of Rajasthan, 1979 Indlaw SC 39 are equally applicable in the present case. The State will do what is fair and just to the appellant as indicated by this Court in that order.
4.  We accordingly reject the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Karnataka High Court at Bangalore.There will be no order as to costs of the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
