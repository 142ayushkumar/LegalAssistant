Collector of Central Excise, Vadodra v Dhiren Chemical Industries
Supreme Court of India

28 October 1999
C.A. No. 7937 of 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  There appears to us to be an apparent conflict between the view taken earlier in CCE v. Usha Martin Industries 1997 Indlaw SC 2986 and the view taken in Motiram Tolaram v. Union of India 1999 Indlaw SC 526 .
2. Both are judgments of Benches of three learned Judges. This matter must, therefore, be heard by a Constitution Bench.
Place before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate directions
Order accordingly.
