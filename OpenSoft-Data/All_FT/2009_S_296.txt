Smitha Nath v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

26  May  2009
Writ Petition(C) No. 216 of 2009
The Order of the Court was as follows :
The Application for impleadment is allowed.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  On 13.1.2009, exam was conducted by AIIMS for 50% post graduate medical seats for all government/municipal colleges in India (except for the government medical Colleges in the States of Andhra Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir). The First Round of Counseling for these seats ended on 16.3.2009, which was conducted by Director General of Health Services (DGHS). Thereafter, the States and Uts commenced their first round of counseling which was to be completed by 10.4.2009.
2.  However, most States did not complete their first round of counseling in time. The 2nd Round of All India Counseling by DGHS was conducted between 22.4.2009 and 8.5.2009. This, however, was incomplete since all the States/UTs did not report the correct number of All India Vacant Seats after the first round of State counseling in time.
3.  We have persued the Order dated 2.5.2008 passed by this Court in the case of Dr.Amit Gupta and Others vs. Union of India and Others in I.A. No.17 of 2008 in W.P.(C) No.157 of 2005, where in similar circumstances this Court had directed an extended 2nd Round of All India Counseling to fill up those seats which could not be included in the Original 2nd Round of counseling.
4.  In such circumstances, we direct that an extended 2nd Round of Counseling be conducted to fill up the seats which could not be filled up in the Original 2nd round of counseling due to incomplete information furnished by the States at the time when the 2nd Round of Counseling was conducted. All the States and UTs shall abide by the following schedule for the extended 2nd Round of counseling.
5.  We further direct that Counseling will be only in the Delhi Centre.
6.  This order will be placed on the websites immediately. Copy of this order shall be given to all the parties today itself.
The Writ Petition is disposed of in the above terms.
