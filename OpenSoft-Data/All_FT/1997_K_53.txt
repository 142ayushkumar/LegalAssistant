Pathuma and Others v Kallara K. Mohammed and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 April 1997
C.A. No. 2833 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 3182 of 1997)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1. The High Court by the impugned judgment allowed a revision and condoned delay of about 17 years in filing the appeal which had not been condoned by the appellate authority. The reason given by the High Court for interfering with the finding of fact of the appellate authority is as under:
"On going through the order of the appellate authority in IA No. 164 of 1993, it appears to me that the appellate authority has adopted a very technical approach to the question"
2.  In our opinion, this treatment of the question by the High Court is most unsatisfactory and there was no occasion for interfering in a civil revision with the appellate authority's order refusing to condone the delay of about 17 years in filing the appeal.
The impugned order of the High Court cannot, therefore, be sustained.
3.  The appeal is allowed.
4. The impugned order dated 30-10-1996 of the a High Court is set aside.
Appeal allowed.
