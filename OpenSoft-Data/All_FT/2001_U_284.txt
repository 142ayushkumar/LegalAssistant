IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
2. CIVIL APPEAL NO. 920 OF 2001 [Arising out of SLP(C) 17954/2000] Union of India ... Appellant vs.
Datta ... Respondent
3. Heard the learned Additional Solicitor General for the appellant and Mr.Anis Ahmed Khan, the learned counsel for the respondent.
4. The order of the Division Bench of the High Court declining to condone the delay of 66 days in filing the L.P.A.No.328/2000 dated July 17, 2000, is assailed in this appeal.
5. Against the order of the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi allowing the CWP 4457/1999 on January 24, 2000, the appellant filed L.P.A. with delay of 66 days. The Division Bench, by the impugned order, dismissed the petition seeking condonation of delay and consequently the L.P.A. A perusal of the application filed before the High Court, seeking condonation of delay, explains the reasons for the delay which, in our view, constitute sufficient cause on the facts of this case. It is stated therein that the copy of the order was received on 2.2.2000. Thereafter the draft was put up for approval on 6.3.2000. After the same has been 2 approved the appeal was filed. It is plain that the delay was due to lethargic approach of the clerk who failed to take prompt action. The delay is not so exhorbitant as to hold the appellant guilty of inaction. In such matters the officers concerned have to deal with the inert and inactive staff sternly but for such delay of short period a public cause can not be allowed to suffer. In our view, interest of justice demands that such delays be condoned.
At the same time care must be taken to ensure that the respondent does not suffer in the process of the appellant seeking relief of condonation of delay and therefore he should be adequately compensated. .In the facts and circumstances of the case as respondent is a freedom-fighter and on account of the slack approach of the appellant's staff he was made to come to this Court to defend the case, we consider it apropriate to direct the appellant to pay costs of Rs.5000/- to the respondent within four weeks from today. The appeal is allowed on payment of the costs. The order under challenge is set aside and CM No.1047/2000 is allowed.
The L.P.A. and CM No.1048/2000 are restored to the file of the High Court, which will now be decided in accordance with law. Till such time the Division Bench hears and decides the application for 3 stay of the order of the learned Single Judge, the contempt proceedings shall remain stayed.
Appeal is accordingly allowed.
