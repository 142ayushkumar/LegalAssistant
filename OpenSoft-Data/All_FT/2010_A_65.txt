22 September 2010
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No(s). 11114/2009, with SLP(C) No. 17219 of 2009
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. The issue involved in this case is in regard to the award covered by the Arbitration act, 1940. The Arbitrator has awarded pendente lite interest ignoring an express bar in the contract regarding award of interest.
2. There are two decisions of this Court which have taken the view that the Arbitrator can award pendent lite interest. They are Board of Trustees for the Port of Calcutta vs. Engineers-De -Space-Age 1996 (1) SCC 516 1995 Indlaw SC 1 followed in Madnani Construction Corpn. (P) Ltd. vs. Union of India & Ors. 2010 (1) SCC 549 2009 Indlaw SC 1828.
3. In two other decision that is, Syed Ahmed & Co. vs. State of U.P. 2009 (12) SCC 26 2009 Indlaw SC 843 and Sree Kamatchi Amman Construction vs. Divisional Rly.Manager/Works & Ors. 2010 (8) SCALE 293 2010 Indlaw SC 650, this Court has expressed a doubt whether the decision in Engineers-De-Space-Age 1995 Indlaw SC 1 (supra) is good law in view of the Constitution Bench judgments in Irrigation Department, Govt. of Orissa vs. G.C. Roy 1992 (1) SCC 508 1991 Indlaw SC 421 and Executive Engineer, Dhenkanal Minor Irrigation Division vs. N.C. Budharaj 2001 (2) SCC 721 2001 Indlaw SC 19768, which held that Arbitrator had the jurisdiction and authority to award interest in regard to three periods, namely, pre-reference period, pendente lite and future period, if there was no express bar in the contract regarding award of interest. However, this Court in Syed Ahmed & Co. and Sree Kamatchi Amman Construction 2010 Indlaw SC 650 (supra) did not examine the matter further as those cases related to matters arising under the new Act, namely, Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
4. In view of the above legal position, we refer this matter to a Larger Bench for decision. Place the matter before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders.
Order accordingly
