Nirmal K Phathak and Others v State of Bihar and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.22588/1997
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave is granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal is directed against the order of the High Court declining to condone the delay of 21 days in filing the L.P.A. 304/97 and dismissing the same on 11.8.1997.
2.  A perusal of averments in the petition, I.A.1273/97 in LPA 304/97, shows that the delay was caused due to bereavement in the family of Shri R.S.Rai, Senior Advocate, on account of which he could not file the apeal in time. In our view, this is eminently a sufficient cause to condone the delay of 21 days.
3. We accordingly set aside the order under challenge, allow the said I.A., condone the delay and remit the matter to the High Court for disposal of the appeal in accordance with law.
The appeal is thus allowed.
No costs.
Appeal allowed.
