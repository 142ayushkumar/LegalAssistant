Jayashree Sengupta and others v Subh Karan Bajoria
Supreme Court of India

10 April 2003
C.A. No. 3320 of 2003 (S.L.P.(C) No. 604 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court, by the impugned order, interfered with the orders passed by the courts below and set aside the order made for local inspection. It further directed that, if need be, the trial court may consider the relevant facts and could direct for the inspection.
2.  We are of the view that while exercising the jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the High Court committed a serious error in interfering with the findings of fact, that too in regard to an order made on an application.
3.  In this view of the matter, without stating anything more, we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
