Vivek Aggarwal v State of Delhi
Supreme Court of India

5 November 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2909/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard Shri V.A. Mohta learned senior counsel for the petitioner and Shri B.A. Mohanty learned senior counsel for the respondent. We have perused the copy of the statement of Anurag Chaturvedi which has been referred to in the order under challenge. We are not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the High Court refusing petitioner's prayer for anticipatory bail.
2. However, it will be open to the petitioner to surrender and file an application for regular bail. If such an application is filed, the court will dispose it of expeditiously.
The SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
