State of West Bengal and Others v Mohurgong and Gulma Tea Estates and Others

Transfer Petition (Civil) Nos. 391 and 474 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We see no reason for the transfer of these matters to this Court. The High Court concerned can dispose of the petitions in the light of our decision in Writ Petitions Nos. 5409-10 of 1980 (Tata Tea Ltd v. State of West Bengal) and other connected writ petitions.
2.  These transfer petitions are, therefore, rejected. There will be no order as to costs.
Petitions dismissed.
