Chairman, U.P.State Bridge Corporation and Others v Rakesh Singh
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19191-19193/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We see no justification for the High Court having directed the appointment of the respondent by an interim order. If the High Court was convinced that there was merit in the case of the respondent, then the High Court ought to have finally decided and allowed the writ petition rather than passing interim orders, threatening contempt, as is evident from the order dated 28th April, 2000 and then passing an interim order directing the appointment.
2. We would not like to make any further observations, but the interim orders dated 28th April, 2000, 9th May, 2000 and 17th May, 2000 of the High Court are set aside.
3.  The High Court will now dispose of the writ petition on merits. These appeals are allowed accordingly.
Appeals allowed.
