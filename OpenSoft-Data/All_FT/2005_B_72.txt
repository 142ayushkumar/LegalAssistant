Commissioner of Central Excise-Ii, Chennai v Beacon Neyrpic Limited
Supreme Court of India

26 October 2005
C.A. No. 7356 of 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Assuming that the assessee was related to its subsidiary company i.e. M/s. Best and Crompton Ltd. (B and C.L.), this by itself would not be sufficient for the purpose of invoking the Central Excise (Valuation) Rules, 1975 read with Section 4(l)(a) of the Central Excise Act, 1944.
The department would have to go further and show that the relationship has introduced an element other than purely commercial consideration in effecting the sale by the assessee to the BCL. No such evidence has been produced by the Revenue.
In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
