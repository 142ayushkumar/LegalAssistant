NTPC Limited v Surendra Prasad Jha and others
Supreme Court of India

14 January 2004
C.As. Nos. 2781-84 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In these appeals, the appellants were the body on whose behalf the land was acquired. The appellants had not been made parties before the Reference Court and the Reference Court by its award has enhanced the compensation. Application made by the appellants to review the award was rejected by the Reference Court. The appellants then filed revision petitions in which the High Court has passed the impugned order dated 24-2-1998 stating that these revisions should be treated as appeals under Section 54 of the Land Acquisition Act.
2.  We have today, by a separate judgment in Civil Appeal No. 2780 of 1998, held that the body on whose behalf the land is acquired is a necessary and proper party before the Reference Court. We have held that an award passed in their absence is required to be set aside and the matter be remitted back to the Reference Court.
3. For reasons set out in that judgment, we dispose of these appeals by setting aside the impugned judgment as well as the award made by the Reference Court. We remit the matter back to the Reference Court with the same directions as given in the judgment passed in Civil Appeal No. 2780 of 1998.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
