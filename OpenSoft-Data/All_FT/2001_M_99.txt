Board of Trustees v Macgregor Navire Port Equipment A.B. and Anr
Supreme Court of India

3 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17263/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  We find that the appellant invoked the bank guarantee on 29th March, 1988. The Standard Chartered Bank, for reasons best known to it, chose not to make the payment and on 28th April, 1988 the High Court granted stay of encashment of the bank guarantee. On 21st March, 1991, order was passed by the High Court on the notice of motion requiring respondent No. 1 to keep the bank guarantee alive.
2.  We are told that the bank guarantee on 24th February, 1989 had already expired and, therefore, the question of making payment did not arise.
3.  It is quite evident from the facts stated above that there was a clear complicity between the Bank and respondent No. 1. The Bank accommodated respondent No. 1 by choosing not to make payment for a period of one month after the invocation of the bank guarantee which enabled respondent No. 1 to get an injunction.
4. Hence what is more serious is that when the Court passed the order on 21st March, 1991, it was not informed by the Bank that the bank guarantee had already expired and passing of any order would become infructuous. We are not satisfied with the conduct of the Bank which seems to indicate its desire to even mislead the Court with a view to help respondent No.1.
5.  By this interim order, we direct respondent No. 2 that pending hearing of the appeal, it shall pay to the appellant the amount of the bank guarantee which was invoked on 29th March, 1988 along with interest at the rate of 18 per cent with quarterly rests with effect from the date of the invocation of the bank guarantee. In the event of the appeal being dismissed, the appellant would be under an obligation to return the money along with the same rate of interest.
Appeal dismissed.
