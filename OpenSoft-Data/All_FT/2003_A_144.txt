The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appeal filed by the first appellant before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short, "the National Commission") was disposed of by remitting the matter to the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short "the State Commission") with a direction that the State Commission "may take into account the evidence recorded in the criminal case".
2. The National Commission also imposed costs to the tune of Rupees ten thousand on the first appellant herein because it was displeased with the "attitude of the Counsel for the Complainant."

No costs.
