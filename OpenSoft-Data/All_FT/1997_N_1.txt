Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras v N. D. George Polous
Supreme Court of India

13 March 1997
C.As. Nos. 10158-59 of 1983
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Revenue has appealed against the judgment of the Madras High Court rendered in CIT v. ND. Georgopoules 1980 Indlaw MAD 160.
2.  Stated briefly, for the Assessment Year 1965-66, the assessee filed a nil return. The return was accepted. The file was closed. The office also issued assessment form and a demand notice under Section 156 of the Act mentioning the amount demanded as "Nil". The Income Tax Officer could notmake the assessment for the year 1966-67, before the dates on which estimates of advance tax for the years 1967-68 and 1968-69 were due. For the Assessment Years 1967-68 and 1968-69, the Income Tax Officer took the view that the assessee was liable to furnish an estimate of advance tax for these two years and he failed to do so. He charged interest under Section 217 of the Income Tax Act for these two years.
3.  The assessee contended that for the years 1967-68 and 1968-69 the assessee was not under an obligation to furnish "estimate" under Section 212(3) of the Income Tax Act, since there was a regular assessment for the year 1965-66. The assessee also contended that the charge of interest was not proper. This plea was negatived by the Income Tax Officer and also by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
4.  In the second appeal the Appellate Tribunal held that the assessee had been assessed by a regular assessment for the year 1965-66 and so the assessee was under no obligation to furnish an estimate under Section 212(3) and, therefore, the charge of penal interest was not proper. The mistake in levying penal interest should be rectified under Section 154 of the Act. At the instance of the Revenue two questions of law were referred to the High Court. The High Court held that the assessee was not under an obligation to submit an estimate under Section 212(3) of the Act, for the years 1967-68 and 1968-69 as it had been previously assessed (by the said "nil" assessment) for the year 1965-66.
5. In that regard, the High Court relied upon the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in Esthuri Aswathiah v. ITO  1960 Indlaw SC 1891960 Indlaw SC 189.
The High Court further held, that the assessee who had been previously assessed, had been taken erroneously to be a "new assessee", and penal interest had been charged on the basis that it had not submitted an estimate under Section 212(3). It was a patent mistake since the assessee was not obliged to submit an estimate under Section 212(3) of the Act. The application for rectification of the assessment order was maintainable under Section 154 of the Act5. We see no error in the decision of the High Court and the appeals are accordingly dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
