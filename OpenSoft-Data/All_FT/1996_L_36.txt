Life Insurance Corporation Of India & Ors. v The Central Industrial Tribunal, Jaipur & Ors.
Supreme Court of India

18 November 1996
C.A. No. 8418 of 1994 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 27 April 1994 of the Rajasthan High Court in D.B.C.S. (Writ) No. 477 of 1992)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
The Point involved in this case is the same as in Civil Appeal No. 54 of 1993, R. Thiruvirkolam vs. The Presiding officer & Anr . For the reasons given by us in the judgment delivered today in R. Thiruvirkolam, it must be held the order or removal from service in the present case operates from December 12, 1969 when it was made by the employer and not from any subsequent date.
The direction made in the impugned judgment for payment of wages to the deceased workmen from December 12, 1969 to December 7, 1987, the date of his death is, therefore, set aside.
1. However, the amount of Rs. 50,000/- paid the heirs of the deceased workman under the interim order of the Court is not required to be refunded by them to the employer.
Consequently, the appeal is allowed in the above terms. No costs.
Appeal allowed
