Chandra Deo Bind and another v State of Bihar and others
Supreme Court of India

25 August 2004
S.L.P. (C) No. 17547 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Taken on board.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Contention of the petitioner in this SLP is that the impugned order is based on a concession which according to the petitioner is not actually made by him or his counsel, he has filed an affidavit to this effect. On the facts of this case, we think it more appropriate that error, if any, in the impugned order should be brought to the notice of the High Court in the first instance.
2. Therefore, we direct the petitioner to approach the High Court and point out the fact that there was no such concession made.
3.  Since we are directing the petitioner to approach the High Court, we also think it appropriate that the election scheduled to be held on 29-8-2004 may be held on that date but result of the election shall be withheld until further orders of the High Court. With the above observation, the special leave petition is disposed of.
Petition disposed of
