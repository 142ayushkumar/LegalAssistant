Improvement Trust, Hoshiarpur and Others v Land Acquisition Tribunal, Hoshiarpur and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 January 1995
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Substitution application allowed.
Leave granted.
1.  We rather find it difficult to appreciate the line of reasoning of the High Court where it says that "the letters patent appeals were highly belated". The word 'highly' should normally connote as if the delay was inordinate. In fact it is not so. It is delayed only by a few days. The High Court in our considered view could have viewed the matter in the proper perspective and condoned the delay in the facts and circumstances of the case.
2.   Therefore, we are obliged to set aside the impugned order. The letters patent appeals will stand restored to file and be heard on merits. We request the High Court to dispose them of as expeditiously as possible having regard to the fact that the matters are sufficiently old. The appeals are disposed of. No costs.
Appeals disposed of.
