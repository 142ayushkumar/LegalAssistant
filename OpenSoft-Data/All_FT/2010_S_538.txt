Anjul Ahlawat and others v State of U.P. and another
Supreme Court of India

6  May  2010
Criminal Revision No. 1241 of 2010
The Judgment was delivered by : D.Y. Chandrachud, J.
1. Heard learned counsel for the revisionists, learned A.G.A. for the State and perused the record.
2. This criminal revision has been directed against the order dated 09.03.2010 passed by Additional Judicial Magistrate, Court No. 1, Bulandshahr in Criminal Case No. 9214 of 2009 by which the application for discharge of the revisionists has been dismissed.
3. The brief facts giving rise to this criminal revision are that opposite party No. 2 Smt. Renu Ahlawat was married with revisionist No. 3 Naveen Ahlawat on 28.09.98. Revisionist No. 3 was working as Captain in the Army at the time of his marriage. A girl child was born out of the wedlock of opposite party No. 2 with revisionist No. 3. It is alleged that the revisionists started harassing opposite party No. 2 soon after the marriage due to demand of additional dowry. The father of opposite party No. 2 had tried to satisfy the revisionist No. 3 and his parents by giving about four lacs.
The greed of the revisionists did not stop here. Revisionist No. 3 and his parents even started committing maarpeet with opposite party No. 2. Revisionist No. 1 and revisionist No. 2 were insisting for luxury car from opposite party No. 2 and started beating her for the same. Opposite party No. 2 was forced to sign some papers. Opposite party No. 2 was brutally beaten on 18.10.2006. Opposite party No. 2 made a complaint to Higher Army Authorities. On 10.12.2006, opposite party No. 2 and her daughter were forcibly lifted in a car and thereafter abandoned.
4. It is being submitted by learned counsel for the revisionists that revisionist No. 3 is serving as Army Officer and was not present on the dates when it is said that he had caused beating to opposite party No. 2. The offence under Section 498-A I.P.C. is a continuing offence . Moreover, the burden to discharge the plea of alibi rest on the shoulder of the person who pleds for it. Further submission is that the learned Magistrate has relied upon the affidavits of the witnesses, which are extraneous for consideration. May be so, but the statement of opposite party No. 2 recorded during the course of investigation under Section 161 Cr.P.C. cannot be ignored while framing the charge.
5. I thus, do not find any illegality or irregularity in the impugned order dated 09.03.2010.
6. The criminal revision is thus, found to be devoid of any merit and is dismissed accordingly.
Order accordingly
