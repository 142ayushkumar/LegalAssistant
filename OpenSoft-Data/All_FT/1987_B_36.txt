Balram Das and Others v State of Uttar Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 February 1987
C.A. No. 359 of 1987 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) No. 3944 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Special leave is granted. Appeal is heard. A group of writ petitions was disposed of by the High Court of Allahabad by a common judgment. Writ Petition No. 4774 of 1984 giving rise to the present appeal was one of the matters so disposed of. Learned counsel for the appellants has called into question the order under appeal insofar as the appellants herein are concerned on the ground that the facts pertaining and the points urged in the context of the facts peculiar to the appellants' case have not been dealt with in the judgment under appeal. It appears that as a large number of matters were dealt with by one common judgment, by inadvertence the High Court has failed to deal with, discuss and decide the questions arising in the context of the facts pertaining to writ petition instituted by the appellant.
2.  We, therefore, consider it just and proper to set aside the judgment of the High Court insofar as Writ Petition No. 4774 of 1984 giving rise to the present appeal is concerned and remand the matter back to the High Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law. We accordingly allow this appeal, set aside the judgment insofar as the aforesaid Writ Petition No. 4774 of 1984 is concerned and remand the matter to the High Court for fresh disposal. The appellants will not be dispossessed during the pendency of the appeal in the High Court
3.  The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal Disposed of.
