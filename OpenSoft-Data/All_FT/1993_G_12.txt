G.T. Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana v Union Of India
Supreme Court of India

10 December 1993
S.L.P. (Civil) No. 15723/93, Dt. 10 December 1993
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned senior Counsel for the petitioner. The High Court was persuaded to the view that where a statutory 'remission' application was pending, it was inappropriate for the High Court to interfere. Sri Santosh Hegde, learned senior Counsel says that on a similar question other writ petitions are actually pending in the High Court.
2. But, it is not clear from the submission whether even in those cases the High Court was examining the matter even though similar remission-applications were pending.
3.  We make it clear that if the petitioner withdraws the remission- application and approaches the High Court, the High Court might examine the matter without reference to the delay if other similar matters are pending.
The petition for special leave is disposed of finally.
Petition disposed of.
