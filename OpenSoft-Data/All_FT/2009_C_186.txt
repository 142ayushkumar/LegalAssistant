Commissioner of Income Tax, Shimla v Bilaspur District Truck Operators Transport Cooperative Society Limited
Supreme Court of India

16 March 2009
C.A. No. 1710 of 2009 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 11931 of 2007)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
None appears for the respondent, though served.
Delay condoned. Leave granted.
1.  M/s Associated Cement Company Ltd. entered into a contract with M/s Bilaspur District Truck Operators Transport Cooperative Society Ltd., the respondent herein. The respondent assessee is a society. Its members consist of truck operators.
2. The question which arose before the High Court in the income tax appeal under Section 260-A was whether the assessee was liable or not liable to deduct TDS under Section 194-C of the Income Tax Act.
3.  In our view, the aforestated question is a substantial question of law. The High Court ought to have decided the said question. It ought not to have dismissed the appeal summarily.
4.  For the aforestated reasons, we set aside the impugned order and remit the matter to the High Court for consideration in accordance with law.
The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
