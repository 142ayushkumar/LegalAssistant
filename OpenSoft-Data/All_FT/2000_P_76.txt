Pharmacy Council of India v Sudhiar Madhukarrao Wadwalkar and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.3682/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal is against an order passed by the High Court affirming the order of the School Tribunal regarding reinstatement of respondent No. 1 as Principal of respondent No.3. Whether the appellant is entitled to prescribe qualifications to post of Principal of the said school is put in issue in this appeal.
2. However, now that respondent No. 1 has been reinstated in service with effect from 01.11.1999 this aspect need not be examined in this matter. We make it clear that, as held by us in Civil Appeal No.3739 of 1996, the question of law raised herein is kept open. In the aforesaid terms, this appeal stands disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
