S. P. Viswanathan (I) v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

W.P. No. 145 of 1989
The Order of the Court is as follows:
1.  By this petition u/art. 32 of the Constitution of India, 1950 
 the petitioner has claimed relief for issue of a writ of certiorari for quashing the order of termination dated December 6, 1989.
2.  The petitioner was a railway employees posted as Commercial Clerk. Charges of misconduct were framed against him and inquiry was held but he did not appear at the inquiry. Pursuant to the inquiry report the disciplinary authority terminated his services. Hence this petition.
3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner urged that since a copy of the inquiry report was not supplied to the petitioner the order of termination is vitiated. He placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Union of India v. Mohd. Ramzan Khan 1990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 577.
4. It is true that this Court has held that if inquiry report is not supplied to the delinquent employee before passing the order of punishment, the order would be rendered illegal. But the decision of this Court is given a prospective effect it will not affect the orders passed prior to the date of rendering of the judgment (November 29, 1990) as would be clear from judgment.
5.  As regards other questions raised in the petition we find no merit in the same. We, accordingly, dismiss the petition. There will be no order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.
