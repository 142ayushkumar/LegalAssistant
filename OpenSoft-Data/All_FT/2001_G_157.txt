Gulshan Rai Nagpal v Principal, Sikkim Government Law College
Supreme Court of India

19 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 56/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel submits that the petitioner would be advised to face the criminal prosecution and raise all his contentions there. His only apprehension is that the criminal court will be prejudiced or trammelled by the observations contained in the impugned judgment of the High Court.
2.  We have no reason to think that the criminal court will be trammelled by such observation. He also requests that he may be exempted from personal appearance in the criminal court . It is for him to make the application for it after making the initial appearance and getting himself enlarged on bail.
3. If any such application is made by him exemption from personal appearance thereafter shall be granted on the following conditions:
"1. A counsel on his behalf would be present in the court whenever his case is taken up.
2. He will not dispute his identity as the accused in the case.
3. He will be present in court when such presence is imperatively needed."
The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
