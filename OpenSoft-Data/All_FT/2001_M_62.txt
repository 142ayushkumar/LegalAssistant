Supreme Court of India

5 December 2001
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7627/1999
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  In as much as the respondents have got themselves repatriated to their parent department, now the question raised regarding the transfer does not survive for consideration.
2. The appeal will have to be disposed of as having become infructuous now keeping the question of law raised in this matter open and such a question will depend upon the appropriate consideration of the relevant documents such as appointment orders or deputation orders and so on.
Appeal disposed of.
