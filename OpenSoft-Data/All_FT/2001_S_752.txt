Raj Kapoor v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

9 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 1648/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On perusal of the record and after hearing learned counsel for the parties, we do not find any convincing reason why the petitioner's prayer for bail was not accepted while three other appellants were granted bail. The High Court has also not given any reason in the order under challenge why the petitioner's prayer for bail was refused. Our attention has not been drawn to any material implicating the petitioner in the assault on the deceased.
2. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner Raj Kapoor shall be released on bail on executing a bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties each of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.
The SLP is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
