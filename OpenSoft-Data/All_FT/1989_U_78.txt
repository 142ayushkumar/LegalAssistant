Inderjit Kaur v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 January 1989
W.P. No. 538 of 1988 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution the validity of Section 125 CrPC has been challenged on the Ground that the section unreasonably limits the maintenance to Rs. 500 for individual. Section 125 provides a speedy remedy against starvation of the civil liabilities of parties. The order made thereunder is tentative and it is subject to the final determination of the rights in civil court.
2.  We, therefore, see no reason to issue rule nisi. Writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
