Bharatbhushan Sonaji Kshirsagar v Abdul Khalik Mohd. Musa and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 December 1993
C.A. No. ... of 1993 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 17238 of 1993)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The High Court's order under appeal is extraordinary. By passing interim orders it has allowed the writ petition, bypassing Section 55-A of the Maharashtra Municipal Act, 1965. Thereunder, the State Government is empowered to remove the President of a Municipality for grounds mentioned therein. The mere fact that there were complaints against the appellant was no ground for the High Court to achieve his virtual removal, for which Section 55-A was meant. That field was open to the State Government alone to act upon. At best a direction could be issued to the State Government to expedite proceedings on the complaint to the respondents. Rather, Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, learned Senior Counsel, appearing for the petitioner states that a direction to that effect may even be made by this Court so that the writ petition before the High Court stands disposed of on issuing such direction.
2.  Adopting that course we allow the appeal and direct the State Government to take steps under Section 55-A of the aforesaid Act within a reasonable time. And by this direction we treat the writ petition before the High Court as if disposed of. Ordered accordingly.
No costs.
Petition Disposed of.
