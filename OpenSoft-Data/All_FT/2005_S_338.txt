State of Andhra Pradesh v Bhooratnam and Company
Supreme Court of India

4  May  2005
C.A. No. 2980 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is filed against the order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated 8-6-1999. This order merely follows a judgment in another tax reference case between the same parties. We are told that no special leave petition had been filed against the main judgment. That judgment has become final between these parties. Even otherwise, we find that the tax reference case arose out of a common judgment passed by the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal in three matters.
2. A tax reference case bearing No. 114 of 1997 had also been filed in the High Court which also stood dismissed. As against the dismissal of Tax Reference Case No. 114 of 1997, the appellant had come in special leave petition over here and that special leave petition stood dismissed on 11-1-1999.
3.  In this view of the matter, we see no reason to interfere. The civil appeal stands dismissed with no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
