State of Karnataka and Another v M. Rangaswamaiah
Supreme Court of India

12 October 1992
C.A. No. 4220 of 1992 [Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 8710 of 1992]
The Order of the Court is as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  M. Rangaswamaiah, the respondent, was awarded the penalty of stoppage of two future increments on April 3, 1986 as a result of departmental proceedings. He challenged the same before the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal. Relying upon the judgment of this Court in Union of India v. Mohd. Ramzan Khan 1990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 577, the Tribunal quashed the punishment on the ground that the copy of enquiry report was not supplied to the respondent.
2.   We are of the view that the Tribunal fell into patent error as Ramzan Khan case 1990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 577 is not applicable to the facts of the present case. This Court in its judgment in Ramzan Khan case 1990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 577 has specifically directed that the law laid down in the said case be operative prospectively. As such, the ratio in Ramzan Khan case 1990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 577 can only be made applicable in those cases where the punishment was awarded after the date of the delivery of the judgment in the said case.
3.  In the present case, the punishment of stoppage of increments was inflicted on the respondent on April 3, 1986 whereas the judgment in Ramzan Khan case 1990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 577 is dated November 20, 1990. It is thus obvious that the Tribunal was not justified in quashing the punishment which was awarded to the respondent much earlier to the judgment in Ramzan Khan case 1990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 5771990 Indlaw SC 577
4.  We allow the appeal and set aside the order of the Tribunal. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
