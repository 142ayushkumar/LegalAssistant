Mannina Narasaiah (Dead) By His LRs v A.K.Durgappa and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7280/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. The only point which is raised for our consideration is whether the High Court was right in setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded by two courts below without framing any substantial question of law.
2. We find that no substantial question of law is framed nor adjudicated. Hence the impugned order is unsustsainable in law and is set aside. The case is remitted back to the High Court to consider afresh, after notice to the parties whether any substantial question of law arises and in case, if arises shall frame the same and dispose it of in accordance with law. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
