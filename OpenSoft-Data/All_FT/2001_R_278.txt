Ravinder Singh Dhillon v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

28 March 2001
IA No 3 In W.P.(Civil) No.111/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We heard Mr. G.L. Sanghi, learned senior counsel for the petitioner and Mr. P.N. Misra, learned senior counsel for the respondent No. 4. This writ petition is filed in the following background:  The Petrol Pump granted to this petitioner as per the license issued has been cancelled by the Delhi High Court as per order dated 5.12.1997.
2. That order was challenged in SLP(C)........./1999 [CC 431-432]. On 5.2.1999 a three Judge Bench has dismissed the said Special Leave Petition.
3.  Subsequently, the petitioner moved an application for review of the order dated 5.2.1999. That review petition was also dismissed on 22.7.1999. In effect the present writ petition is for setting aside all the above decisions which are binding on the petitioner.
4.  We are not presently considering the question of maintainability of such a writ petition. What happened in the meanwhile was that the right to conduct the very same Petrol Pump has been put to auction. The applicant, who is subsequently impleaded as respondent No. 4 herein, participated in the said auction and bid it and he deposited a sum of Rs.38.70 lacs in February, 2000 with Indian Oil Corporation.
5.  At present we are only considering whether petitioner can have the benefit of the ex-parte stay order to continue in his favour.
6. We are not inclined to continue the said order on account of the developments mentioned above. As the question of maintainability of the writ petition is to be decided the writ petition will be tagged with SLP(C) No. 6160 of 1998 and connected matters. The order directing status-quo to be maintained as on 6.3.2000, is hereby vacated.
I.A. is disposed of accordingly.
Application disposed of.
