Kiran Dixit and Others v State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr
Supreme Court of India

10  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Cr.).../2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  As two of the petitioners are reported to be old ladies and considering the offences alleged against them we are inclined to order that petitioners if appear and apply for bail shall be released on bail on each of them executing a bond for such amount as the court deems fit. If the lady accused apply for exemption from personal appearance the trial court shall grant such exemption on the following conditions:
" 1. that they will not dispute their identity as the accused in the case;
2. that a counsel on their behalf will appear for them in the court when the case is taken up; and
3. they themselves will be present in the court when their presence is imperatively needed."
2.  We are not considering the merits of the contention whether a charge could be framed against the petitioners or not because petitioners have a right to urge before the trial court regarding that aspect.
3. Without prejudice to their right raising such contentions before the trial court this Special Leave Petition is disposed of subject to the above observations.
Petition disposed of.
