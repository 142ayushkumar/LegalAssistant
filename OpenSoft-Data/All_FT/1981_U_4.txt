Supreme Court of India

12 January 1981
Writ Petn. No. 976 of 1979
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Mr. S. K. Bisaria says that the petitioner, Ujjagar Singh a reported to have died while in jail but that no information is supplied and despite inquiries, as to how and in what circumstances he died.
We direct the Superintendent of the Ferozepur Central Jail to submit a written explanation to this Court within two weeks from today as regards the circumstances in which Ujjagar Singh died in the Jail. The Writ Petition may be listed before the Court after two weeks
2.  In so far as the other Writ Petitioner is concerned, namely Lal Singh, it is clear from the certificate issued by the Jail authorities, which Mr. Bisaria has produced before us, that he was only 17 years of age when the offence was committed. Taking into consideration the extreme young age of the petitioner, we set aside the sentence of death imposed upon him and sentence him to life imprisonment
3.  The Writ Petition shall stand disposed of accordingly in so far as the petitioner Lal Singh is concerned.
