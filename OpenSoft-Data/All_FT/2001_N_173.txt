Supreme Court of India

25 April 2001
Review Petition(Civil) No.542/2001 in S.L.P.(Civil)No.13829/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  We have carefully gone through the contents of the review petition and connected records. In review jurisdiction we cannot re-entertain for consideration the same pleas which were heard and rejected while hearing the special leave petition.
2.  We find a new plea having been taken up in the review petition that respondent No. 4 was not eligible for appointment under Section 10 (1)(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
3. This plea was not taken up before the High Court nor in the SLP filed in this Court. We cannot, therefore, express any opinion thereon by entertaining the plea for the first time while hearing the review petition.
4.  No ground is made out for exercise of review jurisdiction. The review petition is accordingly dismissed.
Review dismissed.
