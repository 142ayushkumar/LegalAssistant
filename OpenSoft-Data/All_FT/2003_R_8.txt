Supreme Court of India

18 December 2003
C.A. No. 1910 of 1998 (Arising From Cegat's Final Order Reported In 2004 (60) Rlt 48 (Cegat-Del.))
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In this appeal the only question is whether the appellants become entitled to exemption from the date they made an application for registration as an SSI unit or from the date the certificate of registration was issued to them. This question has already been decided by this Court in the case of Commissioner of Central Excise vs. M.P.V. and Engg. Industries reported in 2003 Indlaw SC 323 : 2003 Indlaw SC 323. On the ratio set out in that case, the impugned order is set aside and the appeal is allowed, it being held that the benefit will be available from the date the application for registration was made.
The Appeal stands disposed off accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
