Dhinrendra Kumar Pachauri v U.P. Rajkiya Nigam Limited, Lucknow and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...CC4574/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  In the present case, the petitioner was on deputation from the State of Rajasthan in 1993. The parent department gave its consent to the absorption of the petitioner in the U.P. Rajkiya Nirman Nigam to which he had been sent on deputation. Despite no objection certificate having been granted, the petitioner was not absorbed. As the petitioner was not absorbed, by a letter of December, 1998 the parent department terminated the period of deputation and ordered his posting in the parent department. This letter was challenged in the writ petition filed but the same was dismissed by the High Court. It seems that the petitioner did not join in the parent department despite the order of December, 1998 and when orders of repatriation were passed in 2001 he filed another writ petition in the High Court.
2. The High Court, in our opinion, was right in dismissing it because by virtue of the order of December, 1998 the deputation of the petitioner had already come to an end and the question of his being considered for absorption thereafter did not arise and the decision of Rameshwar Prasad Vs. Managing Director, U.P.Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Ltd. and  Ors. 1999 Indlaw SC 1294 will be of no assistance.
The Special Leave Petition is dismissed with the above observations.
Petition dismissed.
