I.A.No.99
6. This application has been filed for a direction to the Delhi Development Authority to deposit an amount of Rs. 25.44 crores with the Registry of this Court. The money, which is the subject matter of this I.A., was realised by the Delhi Development Authority as part of the sale consideration in respect of the Jhandewalan property. The property had originally been bid for by the applicant. The bid was accepted conditionally and possession was made over to the applicant subject to making payment of the bid amount.
7. The applicant did not pay the bid amount in full. The bid was cancelled and the Delhi Development Authority sought to resume the property.
8. The action of the Delhi Development Authority was affirmed by this Court and the Delhi Development Authority assumed possession of the property and has sold the same. The price of sale was approved by this Court. The applicant claims that the entirety of the sale consideration received by the Delhi Development Authority in respect of the Jhandewalan property should be deposited with the Registry, this is based on the misconception that the cost of construction of the Jhandewalan property had not been recovered from the Delhi Development Authority. Pursuant to the order of this Court the cost of construction assessed at Rs. 16 crores has been deposited in the Court and the amount has been distributed to those who had contributed towards the construction.
9. Apart from this, it is clear that when the Delhi Development Authority reassumed possession, whatever interest the applicant had in the property ceased. When the Delhi Development Authority sold the property, it did so, as the owner thereof and is entitled to keep the balance of the consideration received on sale of the same.
I.A.No.99 is dismissed.
