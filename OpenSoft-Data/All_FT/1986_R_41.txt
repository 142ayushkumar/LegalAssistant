Ram Kishan v Union Territory of Delhi
Supreme Court of India

20 November 1986
Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 4823 of 1986 in S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 2917 of 1986.
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Heard counsel for the petitioner.
1.  As a special case, we are prepared to exempt the petitioner from surrendering to the sentence pending disposal of this special leave petition. On reading the records we find that the trial court had acquitted the petitioner both under Section 337 and Section 338 of IPC.
2.  The High Court reversed the acquittal and convicted him on both counts giving him six months' simple imprisonment and imposing a fine of Rs. 1500. for the petitioner has agreed on our suggestion that this fine should be enhanced to enable higher compensation to be paid to the victims and sentence of imprisonment may be waived.
3.   Keeping this in view, we have suggested to the counsel for the petitioner to come prepared with a sum of Rs. 5000 to effectuate the proposal given by him which he has tentatively accepted subject to the respondent being heard. Notice shall be issued also to the victims to be present in court on the next date of hearing through the learned trial magistrate, so that compensation may be paid and the matter may be closed. December 18, 1986 is fixed for hearing of the respondent as also the victims.
Order accordingly.
