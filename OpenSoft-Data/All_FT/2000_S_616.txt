Dinesh Kumar Bhatti v State of N.C.T. Delhi
Supreme Court of India

13 January 2000
Petn. For Spl. Leave to Appeal (Cri.) No. 2883 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The accused-petitioner prayed for bail while facing a charge under Section 464-A. The prayer for bail having been refused, he has approached this Court. As it appears he is in custody since 18-5-1995, out of 59 eye witnesses, only 20 have been examined so far. We have been taken through the evidence of the victim boy. Learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the prosecution contends that the offence is quite serious, and therefore, the accused petitioner should not be released on bail. But having considered the totality of the circumstances, and without expressing any opinion on the merit of the case, we think that a case for accused being released on bail has been made out.
2. We, accordingly, direct that the accused-petitioner Dinesh Kumar Bhatti be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi, subject to the condition that the said accused Dinesh Kumar Bhatti shall report twice every week in the Police Station, Lajpat Nagar and shall not try to tamper with the prosecution evidence in any manner.
The SLP is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
