Indian Oil Corporation Limited v John F. Gonsalves and Others
Supreme Court of India

6 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17451/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned Solicitor General submits that certain glaring facts appear not to have been brought to the notice of the High Court though some of those facts were mentioned in the counters filed on behalf of respondent Nos. 1 and 3.
2. It is submitted that the petitioner intends to approach the High Court to bring those facts to its notice and seek variation of the impugned order. The learned Solicitor General, therefore, seeks to withdraw the special leave petition.
We record the statement of the learned Solicitor General and dismiss the special leave petition as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
