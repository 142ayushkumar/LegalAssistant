1.  In view of the limited notice issued the respondent would be entitled to arrear wages approximately to the tune of Rs.15/- Lakh and this he will get without doing the job.
2.  In view of the nature of allegations made against the respondent, it is but natural that the employer cannot have any confidence with this sort of Law Officer though the impugned order has been interferred with on technical ground.
3.  In these circumstances, we direct that in place of the direction of re-instatement, the respondent would be entitled to a further sum of Rs. 3/-Lakh as compensation in addition to whatever he is entitled towards back wages and any other amount in accordance with rules. Payment be made within 3 months from today. The SLPs. are disposed of.
