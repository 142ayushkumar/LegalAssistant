Cumbum Roadways Private Limited v Balaguru Bus Service Private Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 December 1976
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 424 1971. Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 22-2-1971 of Madras High Court in W.P. No. 3125 of 1970.

1. This appeal, without any merit, deserves to be dismissed without much ado.
2. The few facts of the case are that the appellant and the respondent, both operators Of stage carriages, applied for a permit on an 86 Km. route.

The aggrieved appellant contends that his permit should not have been set aside, the ground being that the respondent had got an earlier permit on a part of the route.

Considerations of grace, charity and compassion at the expense of public interest are an act of unfairness to the Act. The conclusion, therefore is that the appellant's claim was rightly rejected and the respondent's award was rightly made.
