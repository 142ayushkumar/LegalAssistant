Punjab State Agrl. Marketing Bd. & Ors. v Surjit Singh Johal
Supreme Court of India

22 January 2003
C.A. Nos. 3352 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The validity and correctness of the order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Regular Second Appeal No. 3481 of 1998 is challenged in this appeal. The respondent filed the suit for declaration that he should be deemed to have been in continuous service from 24-3-1981 and that he was entitled for back wages for the period between 3-12-1983 to 2-11-1985. He was appointed as Auction Recorder on a temporary basis on 24-3-1983. His services came to be terminated on 26-3-1983. On 6-6-1983 the Punjab State Agricultural Marketing Board (for short 'th Board') gave permission to create a post of Auction Recorder on a temporary basis for year 1983-84. The respondent made an application on 7-6-1983 as per Annexure P-2 seeking permission to work as an Auction Recorder. Pursuant to the same the appellant -Board appointed the respondent as a temporary Auction Recorder in the pay scale of Rs. 450-800.
2.  Pursuant to the said order he joined his duty. Thereafter his services were again terminated w.e.f 3-12-1983. When it was found that the order of termination w.e.f. 3-12-1983 was bad for violating the provisions of Section 25 F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, (for short 'the Act') he was ordered to be reinstated. The trial court and the first appellate court found that the suit filed by the plaintiff-respondent was barred by time claiming the relief 24-3-1981. The High Court in the second appeal filed by the respondent allowed the appeal and set aside decreed of both the courts below and declared that the respondent was entitled to the pay and allowance from 3-12-1983 to 1-11-1985.
3. While allowing the appeal it is also stated in the impugned order that he was entitled for the consequential benefits taking the view that he was in continuation of service w.e.f. 7-6-1983. The High Court was of the view that the relief sought for, for reinstatement in service had become infructuous in view of the fact that the respondent was already reinstated. As regards the period of limitation the High Court also was of the view that the relief of declaration as regard continuity of service form 1981 was of no consequence having regard to the fact that the cause of action arose subsequently when his services were terminated w.e.f. 3-12-1983.
4.  The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the respondent was not entitled for continuity of service w.e.f. 24-3-1981. According to him the order passed by the High Court gives an impression that continuity of service is with effect from 24-3-1981. He also submitted that the Chairman of the Board wrongly passed the order of appointment of the respondent. Such a plea was not raised in the courts below. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent supported the impugned order.
5.  The plea that there was no violation of Section 25-F of the Act was not taken before the courts below. The argument that the Chairman of the Board wrongly passed the order cannot also be accepted at this state. The apprehension of the learned counsel for the appellants is that the High Court order gives an impression that the continuity of service of the respondent was order w.e.f. 24-3-1981. From a plain reading of the order it does not appear to be so. If the entire order is read is read it is clear enough to state that the continuity of his service is only w.e.f. 7-6-1983 and the High Court gave a relief with regard to back wages only for the period from 3-12-1983 to 2-11-1985 and rightly so.
6. In this view, in our view, we do not find any merit in this appeal. Consequently, the same is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
