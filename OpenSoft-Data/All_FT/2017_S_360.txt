Kumar Khajuria and another v State of Jammu and Kashmir and others
Supreme Court of India

13 July 2017
Civil Appellate Jurisdiction Civil Appeal No(s). 2386-2388/2011 with C. A. No. 2381-2382/2011 C. A. No. 2380/2011
The Judgment was delivered by : Kurian Joseph, J.
1. The issue raised in these appeals relates to the selection of Horticulture Development Officers in Agricultural Production and Rural Development Department. The initial notification for selection was issued in the year 1997. After the litigations, it appears, the candidates have been appointed in the year 2006, pursuant to the orders passed by the Division Bench of the High Court.
2. Even otherwise, having gone through the order passed by the High Court we do not find it difficult to take a different view. All the writ petitioners had participated in the screening test. It is also a fact that all the affected parties were not before the learned Single Judge and finally the High Court has noted that the Public Service Commission has not compromised the merit while making the selection.
3. In that view of the matter, we do not find any merit in these appeals and the same are, accordingly, dismissed.
4. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of.
5. There shall be no orders as to costs.
