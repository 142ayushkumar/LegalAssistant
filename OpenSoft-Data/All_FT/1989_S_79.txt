Smt. Pyar Kaur and Another v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 January 1989
W.P. (Criminal) No. 20 of 1989 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have gone through the papers and have heard learned counsel on behalf of the petitioners at length. This petition has been filed on behalf of the father and mother of Satwant Singh, as stated by the learned counsel. The learned counsel mainly contended that the commitment of Satwant Singh and other accused persons deserves to be quashed as there is some further investigation and the argument is based on the basis of Section 173(8) CrPC.
2.  There was another petition filed by Satwant Singh which has been disposed of by another bench of this Court today which was SLP (Cri.) No. 16 of 1989. There was yet another petition by the learned counsel himself as petitioner in person which has already been disposed of by another bench of this Court.
3.  In our opinion there is no reason to entertain this petition. It is therefore dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
