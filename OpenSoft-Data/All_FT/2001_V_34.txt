Philip Alexander and Others v Valse Koshy and Others
Supreme Court of India

17 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.10589-10591/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondents Nos. 1-6 that the documents P-18 to P-22A and P-26 to P-30 filed alongwith the rejoinder do not form part of the record of the High Court or the trial court.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioner fairly states that the documents were filed overlooking the fact that they did not form part of the previous record and, therefore, leave of the court should have been sought for before doing so.
3.  Presently, the above said documents shall not be treated as part of the record. The petitioners are at liberty to move an appropriate application seeking leave of the court for placing the documents on record which application, as and when moved, shall be considered on its own merits.
Leave granted.
4. The interim order dated 10.7.2001 shall remain in operation until further orders.
Order accordingly.
