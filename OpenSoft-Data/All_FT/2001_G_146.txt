Gtcl Mobile Com Technology Limited v Bank of Rajasthan Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.909/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
Issue notice.
Mr. T R Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel accepts notice.
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the interim order dated 19th October, 2000 ought not to have been modified. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed and the impugned order dated 9th January, 2001 is set aside. The original order dated 19th October, 2000 will remain, the effect of which would be that the plaint will not be returned to the respondent herein, but at the same time the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Jaipur should also not proceed with the case pending disposal of the matter by the High Court.
2. The High Court is requested to decide the case as expeditiously as possible. The parties will have an opportunity of raising any contention which is open to them.
Appeal allowed.
