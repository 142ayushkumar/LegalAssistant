Union of India and Another v V. P. Gautama and Others
Supreme Court of India

12 February 1985
C.As. Nos. 2738 and 2739 of 1984.
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Special leave to appeal was confined only to two questions:
(1) whether the enhanced pension under the liberalised pension scheme was payable with effect from October 1, 1974 and
(2) whether the High Court had any jurisdiction to award interest at 12 per cent per annum.
2. So far as the first question is concerned, it is fully covered by D. S. Nakara v. Union of India. We are not inclined to go into the second question in the present appeals.
3. The appeals are therefore, dismissed. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
