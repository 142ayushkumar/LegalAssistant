Sharwan Singh v State of Rajasthan
Supreme Court of India

18 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 880/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We heard learned counsel for the appellant and the respondent State besides learned counsel for the complainant who got himself impleaded in this matter.
2.  Appellant was arrested on 5.12.2000 in connection with offences, most serious among them being Section 368 with the help of Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code. When it is admitted that he has been in jail during all these months, we asked the State as to any danger in releasing the appellant on bail or as to the necessity for keeping him as an undertrial prisoner for any further period. We did not get any satisfactory answer to the said query except saying that appellant, if allowed to be released on bail, is likely to tamper with the evidence. For safeguarding against such possibility some conditions can be imposed and that would be sufficient in the circumstances.
3. We, therefore, order the appellant to be released on bail on his executing a bond to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bikaner for such an amount as may be fixed by him with two solvent sureties. We direct the appellant to report to the Police Station Bajju (Bikaner District) on all alternate Mondays between 4.00 P.M. and 6.00 P.M. until further orders. He shall not intimidate or influence the prosecution witnesses for the purpose of tampering with evidence. Appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
