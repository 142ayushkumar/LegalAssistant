State of Andhra Pradesh v M. Ramakishtaiah and Company
Supreme Court of India

17 February 1994
C.A. No. 491 of 1977 with C.A. No. 1014 of 1977. C.A. No. 491 of 1977 is by special leave from the judgment and order Dt. 3 August 1976, of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in T.R.P. No. 50 of 1976. The judgment of the High Court is reported at [1976] 38 STC 537. C.A. No. 1014 of 1977 is by special leave against the judgment and order Dt. 3 August 1976 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in T.R.C. No. 1 of 1976. The judgment of the High Court is reported at [1976] 38 STC 531
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Civil Appeal No. 491 of 1977 : This appeal is preferred against the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court allowing the tax revision case filed by the respondent-assessee under section 22 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act. The order of assessment was made in the month of September, 1969. That order was sought to be revised by the Deputy Commissioner under sub-section (2) of section 20 of the Act. After hearing the respondent, the Deputy Commissioner passed orders prejudicial to the assessee. The Deputy Commissioner says that he passed the said orders on January 6, 1973, but it was served upon the assessee only on November 21, 1973. According to section 20, an order in revision must be passed within four years of the order of assessment.
2. In this case, service of the order is after the expiry of four years from the date of the order of assessment. In the circumstances, the assessee raised a contention that the order was in fact made after the expiry of four years but was ante-dated, and therefore, it is bad. The High Court accepted this submission but on a different reasoning. The High Court was of the opinion that every order must be communicated within a reasonable period and since the order of the Deputy Commissioner in this Case was not so communicated, the High court declared that the respondent-assessee shall not be bound by it. This was done by the High Court following its decision in T.R.C. No. 1 of 1976 pronounced on the same day [against which judgment Civil Appeal No. 1014 of 1977 (in this batch) has been filed].
3.  We are of the opinion that the theory evolved by the High Court may not be really called for in the circumstances of the case. We are of the opinion that this appeal has to be dismissed on the ground urged by the assessee himself.
4. As stated above, the order of the Deputy Commissioner is said to have been made on January 6, 1973, but it was served upon the assessee on November 21, 1973, i.e., precisely 10 1/2 months later. There is no explanation from the Deputy Commissioner why it was so delayed. If there had been a proper explanation, it would have been a different matter. But, in the absence of any explanation whatsoever, we must presume that the order was not made on the date it purports to have been made. It could have been made after the expiry of the prescribed four years' period. The civil appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Civil Appeal No. 1014 of 1977 :
5.  Though the dates are different in this case, the facts are substantially similar. Indeed, the delay in communication in this case is more than one year and five months. For the reasons given in Civil Appeal No. 491 of 1977, this appeal too is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
