Meena Chopra v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 November 2001
C.A. No. 6604 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is directed against the order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
2.  By the impugned judgment the High Court struk down the promotion of the appellant on the ground that the accelerated promotion the appellant got in the rank of Principal, will not give her the seniority in the said rank when an inter se seniority between a reserve category candidate and a general category candidate is taken into account in a particular rank.
3.  The said question has now been finally decided by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Ajit Singh (II) v. State of Punjab  1999 Indlaw SC 725.
4. It is, therefore, not necessary for us to examine the matter afresh and the question of inter se seniority will be decided in accordance with the principle enunciated in the aforesaid Constitution Bench decision.
5.  As it appears, respondent no.3, who had filed the writ petition which ultimately was allowed, in the meantime has retired on attaining the age of superannuation. In that view of the matter, the question of appellant's entitlement for getting promotion to the post of Assistant Director on the basis of her seniority in the rank of Principal will have to be redetermined in the light of the principle already ennunciated by this Court in Ajit Singh II (supra) and this appeal has become infructuous. It is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
