Immamun Nissa Begum v Board of Wakfs and Others
Supreme Court of India

1 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20138/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  A petition had been filed before the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India challenging recommendations made by the Chief Executive Officer resulting in the resolutions made by the Wakf Board dated 13.4.1998 and 14.4.1998 cancelling the nominations in favour of the appellant and appointing respondent No. 4 as a Mutwalli.
2.  One of the contentions raised by the appellant is that the Chief Executive Officer has not considered the antecedents of respondent No. 4 before appointing him as a Mutwalli. The High Court on this aspect of the matter stated as follows :
"The Executive Officer has dealt with this ground by holding that filing of some petty cases against Golam Kuddus Mallick does not make him a drunkard or a man of bad character.
This is a finding of fact which cannot be interfered with in exercising the power of judicial review."
3.  However, the material has been placed before us to show that there are criminal cases pending against him in which allegations have been made that he has committed offences arising under Section 147, 148, 427, 379 of Indian Penal Code. The Chief Executive Officer should have taken into consideration this aspect of the matter and he should not have brushed aside the same as mere petty offences. Due consideration should have been given by him to this aspect. That exercise having not been done, we set aside the order made by the High Court and that of the Chief Executive Officer and remit the matter to the Chief Executive Officer for re-examination in accordance with law. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
