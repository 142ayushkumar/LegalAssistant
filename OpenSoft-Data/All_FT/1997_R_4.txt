Union of India and Others v R. Ayyappan
Supreme Court of India

12 September 1997
C.A. No. 6467 of 1997 (Arising out of S.L.P. No. 3097 of 1997)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The dispute relates to an isolated post of Operator (Ice Plant) in the Integrated Fisheries Project of the Union of India. The recruitment rules provide for the post being filled by promotion failing which, by direct recruitment. It is contended by the appellants that the vacancy which is the subject-matter of dispute, was reserved for a Scheduled Caste candidate and hence the first respondent who had been working as an Assistant Operator for the last 26 years and was otherwise eligible for promotion was not a entitled to be promoted to this post since he belonged to the general category. The respondent in fact had been acting as Operator since 31-8-1993 when the previous incumbent voluntarily retired.
2.  The Central Administrative Tribunal, Ernakulam has allowed the application of the respondent on the ground that a solitary post cannot be reserved, relying upon the decision of this Court in Chakradhar Paswan (Dr) v. State of Bihar  1988 Indlaw SC 8831988 Indlaw SC 8831988 Indlaw SC 883 and Chetana Dilip Motghare v. Bhide Girls' Education Society 1993 Indlaw SC 16391993 Indlaw SC 16391993 Indlaw SC 1639.
3.  The appellants have pointed out that in the case of State of Bihar v. Bageshwari Prasad 1994 Indlaw SC 8071994 Indlaw SC 8071994 Indlaw SC 807 this Court held that even a single post can be reserved by rotation on the basis of a roster, distinguishing the case of Dr. Chakradhar Paswan v. State of Bihar 1988 Indlaw SC 8831988 Indlaw SC 8831988 Indlaw SC 883. This view has been reaffirmed by a Bench of three Judges of this Court in Union of India Madhav 1996 Indlaw SC 24361996 Indlaw SC 2436.
4.  In the present case, however, the appellants are unable to point out to us any such reservation of the present post which is a single post, by rotation as contemplated in the case of State of Bihar v. Bageshwari Prasad 1994 Indlaw SC 8071994 Indlaw SC 8071994 Indlaw SC 807 or Union of India v. Madhav 1996 Indlaw SC 24361996 Indlaw SC 2436. The Tribunal, therefore, was entitled to rely upon the decision in the case of Dr. Chakradhar Paswan v. State of Bihar 1988 Indlaw SC 8831988 Indlaw SC 8831988 Indlaw SC 883.
5. The appeal is hence dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
