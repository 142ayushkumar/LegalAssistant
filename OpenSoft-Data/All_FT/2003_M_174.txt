Mehsana Municipality v State of Gujarat and others
Supreme Court of India

24 September 2003
C.A. No. 12512 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mehsana Municipality, the appellant herein filed a writ petition under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India challenging the constitutional validity of Section 41(2) of the Bombay Primary Education Act, 1947 (for short "the Act") and certain orders passed under the Act. The High Court after examining the matter in detail upheld the constitutional validity of Section 14(2) and the orders passed thereunder.
2. The High Court held that the legislature of the State had the legislative competence to enact the Act and its provisions. The same was neither arbitrary nor violative of any of the fundamental rights under Chapter III of the Constitution of India.
3.  We have gone through the order of the High Court carefully and do not find any infirmity in the order of the High Court in upholding the constitutional validity of Section 41 of the Act. The orders passed by the authorities consequential to the exercise of the powers conferred under Section 41(2) are well reasoned. Due opportunity was afforded to the appellant to put its point of view across to the authorities.
4.  For the reasons stated above, we do not find any merit in this appeal and the same is dismissed with no order as to costs.
5.  At this stage, learned counsel appearing for the appellant states that the appellant wishes to approach the State Government for remission of amount demanded or other reliefs. It may do so.
6. However, we decline to express any opinion on the statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant.
Appeal dismissed.
