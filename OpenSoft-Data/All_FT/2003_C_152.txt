Pcc Pole Factory v Collector of Central Excise
Supreme Court of India

30 October 2003
C.A. No. 5747 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appellant is a manufacturer of PCC Poles which are used by the Electricity Board for the purposes of laying electric lines and transmission of electric energy. The Department being of the view that there is no captive consumption in terms of Valuation Rules held that 10 per cent profit will have to be added in finding out the value of these poles and not the actual value disclosed by them. The appellant having lost before the authorities, carried the matter to the Tribunal.
2. The Tribunal upheld the orders made by the authorities and took the view that:
"PCC poles are marketable and where the work is done by job work, there may be some margin of profit in such activity"
3.  In this view of the matter, we think the order of the Tribunal cannot be sustained. The order made by the Tribunal is, therefore, set aside and the enhancement to the extent of 10 per cent is deleted.
4.  The appeal is allowed accordingly. Each party shall bear its own costs.
Appeal allowed.
