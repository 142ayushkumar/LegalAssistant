Satwant Kaur Smt v Managing Committee War Memorial Multipurpose Higher Secondary School and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 January 1995
C.A. No. 2738 of 1985
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The appellant was employed as a teacher in War Memorial Multipurpose Junior High School of the Sikh Regimental Centre, Meerut with effect from 9-7-1959. The Institution was governed by the U.P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921 and the Regulations framed thereunder. Her services were terminated on 31-3-1964. She challenged the order of termination by way of a civil suit which was dismissed. The first appeal and the second appeal filed by the appellant were also dismissed.
2.  The main contention of the appellant before the High Court in second appeal was that under the U.P. Intermediate Education Act, it was incumbent on the Management to have obtained prior approval of the authorities under the Act before terminating the services of the appellant. The High Court came to the conclusion that with effect from 1-10-1963, the Institution ceased to be governed by the U.P. Intermediate Education Act and was brought under the control of the Delhi Board.
3.   On that reasoning, the High Court dismissed the second appeal. We see no ground to interfere with the impugned judgment of the High Court. The appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
