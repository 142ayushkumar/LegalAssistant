P.Harischandra Reddy v National Inst.Of Rural Develop. and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.6507-6510/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  Because of some apparent conflicts in the two decisions of this Court the Bench has referred the matter to a 3-Judge Bench. At the hearing of this case, we found that the question relates to interpretation of two Circulars, one 1958 and the other February 1983 dealing with the fixation of pay of an ex-service personnel on his re-appointment in the Civil Service. The Circulars in question have been issued by the Union of India.
2. Though Union of India is a party-respondent and has been duly served but there has been no appearance on behalf of the Union of India nor any counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the Union of India.
In these circumstances, we think it appropriate to grant leave.
3. The Union of India is directed to file its counter affidavit whereafter the matter can be heard.
Order accordingly.
