Ram Sobet and others v Municipal Corporation of Delhi and others
Supreme Court of India

12 December 2006
C.A. No... of 2006 (Arising out of S.L.P.(C) No. 8609 of 2006)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special Leave granted.
We have heard counsel for the parties.
1.  The appellants before us were removed from their sites where they were carrying on their Tehbazari in the Green Park Market Area. This was done under the impression that they were not authorised to carry on their business in the Green Park Market Area and that they had indulged in unauthorised encroachment on the public streets/foot path. It was also alleged that they were running restaurants in the garb of Tehbazari.
2.  Counsel for the appellants submits before us that they were carrying on Tehbazari pursuant to the permission granted to them by the Chopra Committee and therefore, there was nothing illegal in their carrying on Tehbazari.
3.  We had directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to look into the matter and file an affidavit before us stating the nature of the business which was being carried on by the six appellants and the location of their sites.
4. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has filed its affidavit in which it is conceded that the appellants were carrying on Tehbazari in an authorised manner and there was no justification for removing them from their sites.
5.  In this view of the matter this appeal is allowed. The impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the appellants are permitted to carry on Tehbazari at the sites where they had been permitted to carry on Tehbazari by the Chopra Committee.
6. We, however, clarify that this would be subject to the final scheme that may be approved by this Court.
Appeal allowed.
