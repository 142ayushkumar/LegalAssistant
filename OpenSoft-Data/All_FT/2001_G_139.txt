Gram Panchayat, Village Dhagroli v Jt.Development Commnr.Chandigarh and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19317/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  Writ petition, filed by the petitioner Gram Panchayat in the High Court, was dismissed in limine without notice to the other side. Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are of the opinion that the writ petition filed in the High Court did raise questions of law involving the rights of the petitioner Gram Panchayat which required hearing and decision by the High Court. The High Court was not, therefore, in our opinion, justified in dismissing the writ petition at the threshold.
2.  The appeal is allowed. The order of the High Court is set aside. The writ petition filed by the petitioner shall stand restored on the file of the High Court and be heard and disposed of on merits. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
