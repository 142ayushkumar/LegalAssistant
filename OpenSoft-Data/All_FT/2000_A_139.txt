Anari Devi and Others v New India Assurance Company Limited and Anr
Supreme Court of India

24 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4395/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
We heard learned counsel for the respondents.
1.  Counsel for the petitioners is not present. A request is made on his behalf for an adjournment. This is posted for final disposal and no reason is shown, when three advocates are shown to be for the petitioner, why none is present.
2.  We have considered the impugned judgment. The High Court has enhanced the compensation from what was granted to the petitioners by the claims Tribunal. There is no reason for us to think that the amount granted by the High Court is unreasonably low. We, therefore, do not wish to interfere.
The SLP is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
