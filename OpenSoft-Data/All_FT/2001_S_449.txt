State Bank of India v Ponny Sugar and Chemicals Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

14 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13579/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
We have heard the counsel for the parties.
1. In our opinion, the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal should not have passed the interim orders which it did. The matter is pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, which, in our opinion, is the appropriate authority, on the facts of the present case, for passing interim orders and for disposing of the main case pending before it.
2.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the impugned orders of the appellate authority and the Debt Recovery Tribunal is directed to dispose of the O.A. within a period of six months from today.
Appeal allowed.
