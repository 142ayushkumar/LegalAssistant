Central Bureau of Investigation, New Delhi v Showkat Ahmed Bakshi and Others
Supreme Court of India

4 April 1994
Cr.A. No. ...... of 1994 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. (Cr.) Nos. 3119-23 of 1992)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
Heard on merits.
1.  Admittedly, the charge-sheet against all the respondents had been filed in the Designated Court at Jammu and the trials under the TADA Act were therefore pending before the Designated Court at Jammu. In such a situation, there was no occasion for the Designated Court at Srinagar to entertain any bail application by any of the respondents either directly or via the Designated Court at Jammu since transfer of the same could not have been made by either of those courts. This fact alone is sufficient to indicate that the Designated Court at Srinagar had  no jurisdiction to grant bail to any of the respondents in the matters pending before the Designated Court at Jammu under the provisions of the TADA Act or pending in any other designated Court to which the trials may have been transferred in accordance with the provisions of the TADA Act. The impugned orders made by the Designated Court at Srinagar granting bail to the respondents are therefore without jurisdiction and are hereby set aside.
2.   Accordingly, the appeal is allowed on the manner indicated above. The application made for grant of bail (Crl. MP No. 1088 of 1994) herein also stands rejected. The appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
