The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Learned Additional Solicitor General states that the government definitely expects to be able to fix the economic criteria by January 28, 1992
W.P. No. 1094 of 1991 be tagged on with these cases
2.  Delay in filing amendment applications is condoned. All amendment applications filed challenging the Notification dated September 25, 1991 are allowed. Counter-affidavit by way of reply to the amendment in the petitions to be filed within three weeks and rejoinder, if any, within one week thereafter
3.  All amendments be carried out now in red ink in the original petitions within a week
4.  Hearing of the cases is adjourned to January 28, 1992. Counsel are directed to file a brief summary of their propositions and the authorities relied on by them (merely citations) not exceeding five pages by December 21, 1991. Apportionment of time for hearing of the counsel will be made thereafter. Matters to be listed on January 28, 1992 at the top of the Regular Board
5.  As far as the question of stay granted by us earlier is concerned, we see no reason to pass any order at this stage as the petitions are posted for hearing on January 28, 1992 and in view of the economic criterion not being yet determined and other relevant circumstances, no question of immediate implementation of the notification arises.
