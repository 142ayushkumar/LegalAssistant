Ramphal and Others v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

13 January 2000
Cr.A. No. 40 of 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellants were convicted under Section 304 Part II read with Section 149, Section 325 read with Section 149 and Section 323 read with Section 149 by the learned trial Judge and sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years. The High Court in appeal set aside the said conviction under Section 304 Part II read with Section 149, and while confirming the conviction under Sections 325/149, 323/149 and under Section 147 Indian Penal Code, 1860 reduced the sentence to 2 years. Neither before the original court, nor the High Court, had any application for compounding been filed.
2.  But in this case an application for compounding has been filed and it has been brought to our notice that in the counter-case, on an application for compounding having been filed, the Court has already granted permission and the matter has been compounded. The complainant-informant has endorsed in the application for compounding and the counsel appearing for them also states that the matter has been amicably settled. Taking into account the fact that the occurrence is of the year 1987 and the parties have compounded the matter amongst themselves, we think, in the interest of justice, to accord permission of such compounding.
3.  We, accordingly set aside the conviction and sentence and dispose of this appeal on the basis of compromise. The accused-appellants are in custody. They may be released forthwith, unless required in any other case.
Appeal disposed of.
