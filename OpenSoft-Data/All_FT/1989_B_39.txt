Bharat Singh v State of Madhya Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

21 February 1989
Cr.A. No. 130 of 1989
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Special leave granted.
1.  Heard learned counsel for the appellant and the respondents. In the facts and circumstances off the case it cannot be held proved that the injury caused by the appellant to PW 1, Ramji Lal was grievous injury. though PW 19, Dr. Pankaj Tiwari had suspected a fracture of the bone because of his clinical examination for confirmation suggesting a chipping of none, he had advised skiagrams being taken but no skiagrams appear to have been taken, and even if taken they have not been marked as exhibits in evidence.
2.   In such circumstances we are of the view that the offence committed by the appellant would fall only under Section 324 IPC and not under Section 326 IPC. Consequently the conviction of the appellant has to be modified to one under Section 324 IPC instead of under Section 326 IPC.
3.  It is brought to our notice that the appellant and PW 1 Ramji Lal, the injured person have entered into a compromise and that the appellant has compensated the injured for the injuries sustained by him by paying him a sum of Rs. 15, 000. The injured person appeared before court and admitted the fact of his having received Rs. 15, 000 from the appellant and entering into a compromise with him.
4.  In such circumstances, we think that for the maintenance of good relationship between the parties, the petition for compromise should be allowed. Accordingly permission is granted to the appellant to compound the offence. The appeal is allowed and the petitioner will stand acquitted of the offence under Section 324 IPC.
Appeal Allowed.
