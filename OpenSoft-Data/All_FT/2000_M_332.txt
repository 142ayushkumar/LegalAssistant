Supreme Court of India

21 September 2000
C.A. No. 4568 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Ms. Amita Gupta, learned counsel for the appellant prayed for an adjournment. She submitted that the counsel who was appearing for the appellant was no longer on the appellant's panel. We asked why Mr. Ranbir Singh Yadav, who is shown as the Advocate-on-Record for the appellant, was not present.
2. We were told that he was never on the panel and that he had filed an appearance as the Advocate-on-Record only because the earlier counsel had so wanted.
3.  As far as this Court is concerned, Mr. Ranbir Singh Yadav is the Advocate-on-Record for the appellant. Neither is he present nor is anyone else here to argue the appeal for the appellant. The civil appeal is dismissed.
4.  Learned counsel now states that she will look into the paper-books of the Court and assist us, provided we keep the matter back.
5.  We decline, in the circumstances, to keep the matter back. If counsel desires to assist us, she can do so now. She expresses her inability to do so.
No order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
