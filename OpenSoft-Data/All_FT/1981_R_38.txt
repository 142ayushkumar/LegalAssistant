Ram Shanker and others v State of Uttar Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

24 April 1981
Cr.A. No. 465 of 1981
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing counsel for the parties, we find that it was not a case under Section 307, IPC at all.
2.  We, therefore, convert the conviction of appellant Ram Shanker from one under Section 307, IPC to that under Sections 325/34, IPC. An application has been made by both the parties that the offence may be compounded.
3.  In the circumstances, therefore, so far as the offence under Sections 325/34, IPC is concerned, we sanction the compounding of the offence as the parties have settled their differences and acquit Ram Shanker of the charges framed against him.
4. The offence under Section 323, IPC is compoundable without permission of the Court, and as Sheo Shanker and Nand Kumar have compounded the offence, they are acquitted of the charges framed against them.
Appeal disposed of.
