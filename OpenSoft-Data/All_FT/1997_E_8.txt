Collector of Central Excise, Hyderabad v Electrolytic Foils Limited
Supreme Court of India

27 February 1997
C.A. No. 3980 of 1987
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The service on the respondent has not been possible because the Unit has closed down and the information supplied by the Deputy Commissioner (Legal) is that even land on which the Unit stood has since been sold to M/s.Nagarjuna Palma (India) Ltd. which is constructing its own factory on the land purchased by it.
2. It is, therefore, obvious that the respondent Unit has completely closed down and even the parcel of land owned by it has been disposed of and, therefore, we see no reason in permitting the appellant to pursue this appeal.
3.  We dispose of the appeal for want of prosecution since the respondent cannot be served. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
