C.A. No. 782 of 2000 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) 16451/99)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Limitation notice was issued in this case by the order of this Court dated 25-11-1999 as follows:
"Notice to issue returnable on 1st February, 2000, to show cause why appropriate orders should not be passed even on terms of the alleged settlement dated 27th March, 1991 as learned senior counsel Shri Nariman for the petitioner states that the petitioner will be agreeable to the proposal stated therein and receive the said amount with appropriate rate of interest from that date, to settle the whole dispute.
It is made dear that on the returnable date the Special Leave Petition will be finally disposed of.
There will be ad interim stay of the further proceedings pursuant to the impugned order of the High Court, in the meantime."
2.  The matter arises under the Arbitration Act, 1940. Subsequently Mr. D. R. P. Chowdhury passed an award on 25-3-1998, in a sum of Rs. 43, 49, 320 - with interest @ 16% from 1st May, 1988. This award was made rule of the Court by learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court on 6-4-1999. On appeal by the State the Division Bench in its judgment dated 23-9-1999, came to the conclusion that the appellant was bound by the recommendation of Shri Bharati for Rs. 30, 76, 221 and therefore was not entitled to the sum fixed by Shri D. P. Roy Chowdhury. It is against this judgment the appellant Contractor has filed this appeal. We have already referred to the limited notice that was given at the time of admission.
3.  Learned counsel on both sides have made their submissions in regard to the date from which interest has to be granted and also in regard to the rate of interest. After hearing learned counsel on both sides, we are of the view that on the sum of Rs. 30, 76, 221 as recommended by Shri D. K. Bharati, the appellant is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from 27th March, 1991. We direct accordingly. The appeals is disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
4. The respondent will pay the amount to the appellant within three months from today with interest up to date of payment or at the abovementioned rate. In view of the agreement between the parties it has not become necessary to go into the merits of the various contentions raised in the High Court.
Appeals disposed of.
