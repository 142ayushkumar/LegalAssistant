Union of India v D.K. Vijh
Supreme Court of India

8  May  2008
Civil Appeal No. 7352 of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Heard learned counsel for the appellant. Despite notice, none appears on behalf of the respondent. However, in view of a recent decision of this Court rendered in Nirmal Chandra Sinha Vs. Union of India & Ors., 2008 (4) Scale 839 2008 Indlaw SC 534, we propose to dispose of this appeal on merits.
2.  This appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court. The respondent was appointed as Section Officer on 4/7/1962. Thereafter, he was promoted to the post of Assistant Engineer sometimes in February 1972. On 27/8/1978, he was promoted to the post of Executive Engineer(C) on adhoc basis. The regular selection committee met on 11/4/1997 and recommended for regularisation of the respondent alongwith others w.e.f. 20/3/1997.
3. The seniority list of Executive Engineers was published where it had been shown that the seniority of the respondent is reckoned w.e.f. 20/3/1997. Aggrieved thereby, the respondent filed O.A. before the Central Administrative Tribunal. The CAT allowed the application.
4. The High Court confirmed the finding. Hence, the present appeal by special leave.
5.  The sole question to be determined in this appeal is as to whether the seniority of the respondent in the cadre of Executive Engineer is to be reckoned with effect from the date of the DPC or from the date of occurance of vacancies in the said post.
6. This question has been answered by this Court in a recent decision of this Court in the case of Nirmal Chandra Sinha 2008 Indlaw SC 534 (supra). The said decision squarely covers the facts of the case in hand.
7. Accordingly, the orders of the tribunal and of the High Court are set aside.
8. Original Application filed by the respondent stands dismissed. Appeal is allowed.
