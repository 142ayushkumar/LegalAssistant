Ramesh Yadav and Another
Supreme Court of India

3 March 1997
Contempt Petition (C) No. 589 of 1996 in S.L.P. (C) No. 17014 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On 27-1-1997, the Principal Secretary of the Medical Health and Medical Education Ministry of the State of U.P. was ordered to remain present on the next date of hearing. On 10-2-1997 which was the next date of hearing, we were told that she has gone abroad, flying out of Delhi on 8-2-1997. We thereupon directed the matter to be listed today ordering that she (Mrs. Sumita Kandpal) should be present in Court.
2.  The said officer is present. It is stated on her behalf by Mr. Sorabjee that she had, before leaving Delhi on 8-2-1997, filed an application for exempting her from personal appearance and for fixing another dated for her appearance. That application was, apparently, never filed.
3.  The counsel, on being asked, stated that the said officer had left the country without finding out whether the Court had passed an order exempting her from appearance as required by the order dated 27-1-1997 and fixing another dated for her appearance.
4.  There can be no doubt, in the circumstances, that the said officer, knowing that there was an order of this Court that required her presence, flew out of the country before the dated thereof and was, therefore, not present as directed.
5.  We, therefore, do not, at this stage at least, accept the apology tendered on behalf of the said officer. We issue notice to her to show cause why suo motu proceedings for contempt should not be taken against her.
Order accordingly.
