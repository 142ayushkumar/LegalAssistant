The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  IA No. 22 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 4677 of 1985 and the connected Writ Petitions (Civil) Nos. 263, 264, 563, 569, 610, 464, 266, 450 and 470 of 2006 and 212 and 229 of 2008 shall be listed on 3-12-2008 and 4-12-2008 before the Bench to be nominated by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India to hear these matters. IA No. 2331 shall also be taken up on that date along with the aforesaid cases.
2.  By the earlier order dated 25-8-2008 M.C. Mehta v. Union of India,  it was directed that those who want to take the benefit of the amendments to the Master Plan, 2021 shall give undertaking that no equity shall be claimed if ultimately the amendments are found to be not legal. It was also indicated that any person who makes any construction, alteration or purported misuse shall do so at his own risk.
3.  It is clarified that only on such undertakings by way of affidavits being filed before MCD the Monitoring Committee can be moved for the purpose of de-sealing.
IA No. 2331
4.  This IA shall also be taken up on that date along with the aforesaid cases.
5.  It is brought to our notice by the learned amicus curiae that "provisional regularisation certificates" of unauthorised colonies shall be issued. Needless to say that if it is ultimately found that the stipulations in the order of this Court dated 14-2-2006 in News Item Published in Hindustan Times Titles "And Quiet Flows the Maily Yamuna"  have not been fulfilled then the inevitable conclusion would be that the provisional regularisation certificates issued shall be of no consequence. This shall be clearly indicated to the persons to whom provisional regularisation certificates have been or are being issued.
6.  IA No. 2331 shall also be taken up on that date along with the aforesaid cases.
IAD No. 65563
7.  An unnumbered IA i.e. IAD No. 65563 has been filed. On a bare perusal of the IA it appears that serious attacks have been made on the competency of the members of the Monitoring Committee and the learned amicus curiae. This directly is an affront to the authority of the Supreme Court which has appointed the Monitoring Committee and on whose request the learned amicus curiae is assisting the Court.
8.  Issue notice to the deponent of the petition Shri Bhuwan Mohan who is stated to be working as Secretary of the Society to show as to why action of contempt shall not be initiated against him and as to why exemplary costs of Rs 25,00,000 (Rupees twenty-five lakhs) shall not be imposed on him. The reply, if any, shall be filed within two weeks. The matter shall be listed thereafter. The deponent, Shri Bhuwan Mohan shall appear in person on the next date i.e. on 3-12-2008.
9.  Let the Monitoring Committee indicate its views so far as the reply to Report No. 62 of the Monitoring Committee is concerned.
IAs Nos. 2263-64-A

13.  In our order dated 14-3-2008,  the word "not" shall be added after the expression "it shall be" and before "more than 10".
