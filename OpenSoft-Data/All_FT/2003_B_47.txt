Balbir Kaur v Jagtaran Singh Nayyar and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 October 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Civil) No.9140/2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard the learned counsel appearing on either side.
1.  We are not persuaded to interfere with the orders under challenge in this special leave petition at this stage of the proceedings when civil suits are said to be admittedly pending in respect of certain disputes between parties.
The special leave petition is therefore dismissed.
2.  Dismissal of the special leave petition shall not come in the way of the suits pending being disposed of in accordance with law after hearing both the parties on merits in the light of evidence that may be adduced by the respective parties and it is obvious that such declaration of rights of parties made in accordance with law, will govern the rights of both parties.
3. But at the same time, we make it clear that the issues already got finally settled by the judgment of the High Court dated 29.5.1989 in CRSA Nos. 1330 and 1331 of 1982 as affirmed by this Court will stand apart from all those proceedings and that they cannot be in any manner be undermined or disturbed. Both parties will be at liberty to work out their remedies in terms of the said High Court judgment as affirmed by this Court.
Petition dismissed.
