New India Assurance Company Limited v Nirmala and Others
Supreme Court of India

7 October 2003
C.A. No.6603/1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This appeal is fully covered by the decision of this Court in the case of United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Lehru And Ors. reported in 2003 Indlaw SC 243.
2. We are told that the question whether Insurance Company must first pay and then recover from the owner is pending before a larger Bench. But the decision of the larger Bench has not yet been rendered.
3.  In this case, we find that the Insurance Company has already paid to the claimants.  Therefore, even if the question is answered in favour of the Insurance Company, it would not be equitable to recover the compensation from the claimants. Now that the amount is paid, their remedy if any, would be to recover from the owners. The question of law will be answered by the larger Bench in the pending case.
4.  In this view of the matter, we see no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment. The appeal stands dismissed. No order as to costs.
5.  It is however clarified that the dismissal of this Appeal will not preclude the Insurance Company from recovering, if they are entitled to do so, from the owner.
Appeal dismissed.
