The Order of the Court is as follows :
1.  Learned counsel for the State makes a fervent prayer that the case be adjourned for hearing to Wednesday, February 11, 1981 at the earliest so that he has an opportunity for filing a return. The service on the Additional Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, New Delhi was effected on January 29, 1981, which was just about a week ago, and which gave sufficient time to the Government to make arrangements for filing its return before today. A perusal of the writ petition indicates that the petitioner has a good prima facie case. Under the circumstances the detenu is directed to be released provisionally on furnishing surety in the sum of Rs 10, 000, with two sureties in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Madras.
The matter to be listed on February 13, 1981.
