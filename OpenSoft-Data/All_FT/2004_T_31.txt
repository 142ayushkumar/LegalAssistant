Tapash Majumder and another v Pranab Dasgupta and others
Supreme Court of India

6 August 2004
S.L.P. (C) No. 14413 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard on the question of admission.
1.  The learned counsel for Respondent 6 has made appearance, submitting that he is instructed by the office-bearers of the Club. We find that Respondents 1 to 30 are all office-bearers of the Club and, therefore, for the purpose of hearing on this special leave petition, we assume that the respondents are represented.
2.  The dispute relates to general elections of the East Bengal Club. The petitioners have filed a suit seeking corrections in the voters' list and appointment of a special officer for holding and conducting the elections. By order dated 5-7-2004, the learned Single Judge has refused to stay the holding of the elections and instead directed that the elections may be held and the result of the elections shall abide by the result of the application pending before him. The petitioners went in appeal which has been dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioners have filed this special leave petition.
3.  It is conceded at the Bar that the elections are fixed for Sunday, 8-8- 2004. We are not inclined to stay the elections.
4. However, we allow the petitioners the liberty of filing their objections before the learned Single Judge. Such objections filed before the learned Single Judge shall be heard and decided summarily without regard to the nature and scope of the suit before the learned Single Judge. If the learned Single Judge feels that proper elections have not been held and a case for holding elections afresh is made out, then the learned Single Judge would be at liberty to direct elections being held afresh and pass appropriate incidental and consequential orders.
5.  Subject to the above observations, the special leave petition be treated as disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
