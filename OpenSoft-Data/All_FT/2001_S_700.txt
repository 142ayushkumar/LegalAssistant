State of Haryana and Others v Polu Ram and Anr
Supreme Court of India

25 July 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.11292/1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  It is reported to us that the Government has not fully implemented the directions contained in our order dated 22.11.2000. Mr. Mahabir Singh learned standing counsel for the State of Haryana submitted that the directions in the said order had been substantially complied with in the sense that the salary is being paid on the basis of the regular scale from the month of November, 2000 onwards. Some of the counsel pointed out that the salary on the regular scale is not being paid to some other persons covered by this order. Mr. Mahabir Singh then offered that if instances of those persons left out from being paid like that could be brought to his notice, the Government will be asked to examine and rectify the mistake.
2.  Mr. Mahabir Singh then submitted that regarding arrears to be paid, the Government worked it out and found that a total of about Rs.32 crores (Rupees Thirty Two Crores only) was required on that score alone and hence an application is made for extension of time for payment of the arrears. We allow the interlocutory application No.18 of 2001 for extension which means that the arrears would be paid on or before 13th August, 2001.
3.  Mr. Mahabir Singh then made a request for hearing the arguments on this special leave petitions. We offered to hear the matter after getting the report of full compliance with the directions contained in the order dated 22.11.2000.
4.  List after the report on the said line is made by the Government. Put up all applications along with the SLPs.
Order accordingly.
