Cheenothingal Valli v Cheenothingal Velayudhan and Others
Supreme Court of India

28 March 1995
C.A. No. 4288 of 1995 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 17 January 1991 of the Kerala High Court in C.R.P. No. 1559 of 1989-E)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted. Heard counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal is preferred against the judgment and order of the Kerala High Court allowing a civil revision petition filed by the respondent. The appellant, Valli, is the wife of Arumughan who predeceased his father Maman. The Respondent, Velayudhan, is the brother of Arumughan.
2.   The appellant filed an application before the Land Tribunal under Section 80-B of the Kerala Land Reforms Act. It was rejected by the Tribunal but on appeal, the Appellate Authority reversed it. The order of the Appellate Authority has in turn been reversed by the High Court.
3.  The appellant claimed Kudikidappu right on the ground that she was in possession of the property concerned herein during the relevant period, viz., 16-8-1968 to 1-1-1970. The High Court has found on a consideration of the evidence including the admission of the appellant herself that she has failed to establish her possession and therefore, her claim under Section 80-B cannot be upheld.
4.   The High Court has further found that the finding to the contrary recorded by the appellate authority was arrived at ignoring the evidence of the appellant herself. We see no reason to disturb the finding recorded by the High Court. The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
