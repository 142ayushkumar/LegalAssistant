1. Leave granted.
2. The appellants are before this Court aggrieved by an interim order passed by the High Court in W.P.S.T. No. 52 of 2016. The issue pertains to the selection and appointment of Sub-Inspectors in the State of West Bengal through the Limited Departmental Competitive Examination route.
3. It appears that a few candidates approached the Tribunal with certain grievances regarding discrimination with regard to the height. The Tribunal set aside the entire selection process. That was challenged before the High Court by the State. The High Court declined to grant stay and hence, the appellants are before this Court.
4. When the matter came up before this Court, on 03.02.2017, this Court stayed the impugned order passed by the Tribunal as well as the orders of the High Court.
5. After having heard the learned counsel on both sides, we are of the view that it is in the interest of all concerned that the High Court disposes of the writ petition expeditiously. Accordingly, these appeals are disposed of with a request to the High Court to dispose of W.P.S.T. No. 52 of 2016 expeditiously and preferably within a period of six months from today. The interim order passed by this Court shall continue till the writ petition is disposed of.
6. We do not pass any orders on the application for impleadment. We permit the applicant(s) to get himself/themselves impleaded before the High Court.
