M. R. M. Plantations P. Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

1 October 1997
C.A. No. 2205 of 1987 (Arising as an appeal from the judgment and order Dt. 21 January 1986, of the Madras High Court in Tax Case No. 1624 of 1977).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The assessment year involved is 1974-75 for which the relevant year of account was the period ending March 31, 1974.
2.  The case of the assessee is that even if it has sold the rubber plantation, the profits derived from the sale of plantation should not be taken into consideration for the purpose of imposition of tax under section 104 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The contention of the appellant is that only profits and gains arising out of trading activity can be taken into consideration for the purpose of deciding the question whether the company had distributed the requisite percentage of dividends out of its profits.
3.  We are of the view that the High Court has come to the right decision. The company being an investment company did not have any trading activity. It bought and sold its investments from time to time. The profit attributable to sale of investment may be assessable as capital gains. But we see no reason why such gains made by investment companies are not available for distribution as dividend to its shareholders.
4. There is no finding of fact that the assessee, as a prudent business man, had to retain the entirety of the gains for any legitimate requirement of the company. Section 104 is very clear. A certain percentage of profits or gains made by the assessee will have to be distributed as dividends, otherwise an order under section 104 will have to be passed. There is no dispute that the company is a section 104 company. In the facts of this case we hold that the appeal is without any merit and is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
