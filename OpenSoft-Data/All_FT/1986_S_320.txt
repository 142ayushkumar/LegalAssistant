Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology v tate Board of Technology and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 September 1986
W.P. for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) Nos. 10705-06 of 1986 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 20 August 1986 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in W.Ps. Nos. 4064 and 4054 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner at some length. The learned counsel states that the petitioner is extremely apprehensive of the consequences which will result from compliance with the order of the High Court directing admission of the two candidates and the learned counsel has strenuously contended that respondents 2 and 3 are not qualified at all for admission.
2.  It seems to us that this is a question which is more appropriate for the consideration of the High Court itself as the writ petition is pending before it. We do not propose to interfere at this stage; and therefore, reject these special leave petitions. We make it clear, however, that the respondents 2 and 3, whose admission has been directed by the High Court, will be admitted subject to the adjudication of their rights of admission when decided in the writ petition. Their admission at this stage will not confer any further right to continue in the institution greater than that which they enjoy under prospectus.
3.  The High Court will consider the feasibility of disposing of the writ petition early, if possible, before the end of September 1986.
Order accordingly.
