Ranga Reddy and Others v State of Andhra Pradesh and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 November 1986
C.A. No. 4111 of 1986 (Arising out of S.L.Ps. Nos. 17264 of 1985 and 9854 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  We are of the view that the Andhra Pradesh Administrative Tribunal ought not to have determined the question of seniority without the appellants in both the appeals being before the Tribunal since the determination of this question would directly affect the interest of the appellants.
2.   We would, therefore, allow the appeals, set aside the order made by the Tribunal on September 3, 1984 and the subsequent direction given by the High Court for its implementation and remand the matter to the Tribunal with a direction that the appellants shall be joined as party respondents to the representation before the Tribunal and the representation shall be heard and disposed of by the Tribunal after giving an opportunity of hearing to all the parties including the appellants in both the appeals.
3.  Since the order of the Tribunal as also the subsequent direction given by the High Court for its implementation are being set aside by us, any consequential action taken by the State Government will also have to be set aside but it will be open to any party including the appellants to make an application for interim relief to the Tribunal, if so advised and if such application is made, it would will be for the Tribunal to dispose it of in such manner as it thinks fit
4.  Since the case is an old one we would request the Tribunal to dispose it of at a very early date.
5.  The appeals will stand disposed of in these terms. There will be no order as to costs. Appeals disposed of
Order accordingly.
