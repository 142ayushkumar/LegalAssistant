Bimal Kumar Chanda v State of Tripura and Anr
Supreme Court of India

8 January 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)...CC 9160/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  No sufficient cause is shown to condone the delay of 1349 days. Though the plea of the petitioner is that delay has occasiosned on account of the filing of the review petition, on a perusal of documents it appears that the High Court delivered the judgment in December, 1996, and the review petition was filed in September, 2000.
2.  Therefore, filing of review petition will not enure to the benefit of the petitioner in computing the period of delay. We are not satisfied that the explanation for the delay makes out sufficient cause. I.A. No.1, application for condonation of delay is dismissed. Consequently, the Special Leave Petition is also dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
