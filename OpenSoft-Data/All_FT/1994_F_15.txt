Commercial Taxes Officer v Foreign Import and Export Association
Supreme Court of India

10 August 1994
C.As. Nos. 3005 to 3008 of 1980. Appeals by special leave from the judgment order Dt. 5 July 1979, of the Rajasthan High Court (Jaipur Bench) in D.B.S.T.R. Nos. 76, 77, 81 and 82 of 1978. The judgment of the High Court is reported at [1980] 45 STC 265
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals are directed against an order of the Rajasthan High Court dismissing the petitions filed by the appellant (Commercial Taxes Officer, Circle A, Kota), requesting the High Court to direct the Board of Revenue, Rajasthan at Ajmer, to state a case for the opinion of the High Court under section15(3A) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1954.
2.  The High Court by its order dated July 5, 1979 held, while dismissing the said applications, that the respondent cannot be said to have acted deliberately in contravention of law without any reasonable excuse in undertaking on job basis the work of processing goods belonging to other dealers meant for sale. At the same time, the High Court declined to express any opinion on the correctness or otherwise of the interpretation placed by the Board on section 8(3)(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act.
3. Since these matters pertain to levy of penalty and having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and the findings recorded by the High Court, which could not be challenged successfully before us, no interference is called for.
Accordingly, civil appeals are dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
