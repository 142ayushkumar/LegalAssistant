State of Uttar Pradesh and Others v Mohd. Irfan Ansari
Supreme Court of India

26 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16566/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  We are not satisfied that the case of the respondent was identical to that of Rohit Misra which is the precedent relied upon by the High Court in granting relief to the respondent.
2. It is the case of the appellants herein that there was no request for extension of time received from the respondent and the High Court in the impugned judgment has not adverted to this part of the controversy. The pleadings before the High Court clearly show that the submission of the application by the respondent for extension of time was refuted. The High Court ought to have gone into this aspect before disposing of the writ petition.
3.  It will be appropriate, in our opinion, that the case is remanded to the High Court for a fresh decision.
4.  We, accordingly, allow this appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and direct it to decide Civil Misc. Writ Petition No. 35090 of 1999 afresh.
Appeal allowed.
