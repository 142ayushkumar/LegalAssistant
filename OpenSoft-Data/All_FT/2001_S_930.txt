American Tools Companies Inc v State of Maharashtra and Others
Supreme Court of India

9 April 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 701/2001
The Order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We are of the view that in this case, pending the receipt of the investigation report, the goods ought not to have been released to Respondent Nos.2, 3 and 4. On their behalf, it is submitted that the investigation report is being delayed. For the purposes of ensuring that it is given expeditiously, Respondent Nos.2, 3 and 4 may take such steps as are appropriate and may, after such report has been received and considered by the learned Magistrate, make an application for release of the goods, which shall be decided on its merits.
2. As far as this impugned order is concerned, it must be set aside. The appeal is allowed and the order under challenge is set aside. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
