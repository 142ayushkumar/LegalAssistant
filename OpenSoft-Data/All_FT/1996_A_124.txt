Admission Committee C.I.I. 1995 and Another v Anand Kumar and Another
Supreme Court of India

15 March 1996
C.A. No. ... of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 6665 of 1994)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard counsel for the parties. Leave granted.
1.  We are unhappy to note that the High Court has chosen to believe the version of the student against the Members of the Selection Committee. It was a case of word against word and in the absence of any mala fide or any other supporting material, one should have thought that the Court would have preferred to accept the version of the Selection Committee. Moreover, calling upon the Selection Committee to answer and justify each and every selection made, in the absence of any mala fides is to cause impossible burden upon it.
We therefore set aside the judgment of the High Court but so far as the respondent is concerned, since three years have passed by since the admission to the course of his choice, we are not inclined to disturb him at this distance of time.
2.  The appeal is accordingly allowed subject to the above directions. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
