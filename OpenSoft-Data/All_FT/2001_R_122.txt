B. Sarojini v Rajeswari Subramaniam and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 October 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13871-13872/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
1.  These SLPs. are by the tenant against an order of eviction passed by the Rent Controller under the provisions of Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960, which order of eviction has been upheld in appeal as well as by the High Court in revision. The forums below, on consideration of materials, have come to the conclusion that the tenant has committed willful default in the payment of rent, and as such incurred liability of being evicted.
2. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that this conclusion is erroneous inasmuch as certain advances  paid had not been adjusted, which ought to have been adjusted, and further the arrears, if any, during the pendency of the proceedings cannot be taken into account.
3.  We, however, on examining the records and the relevant provisions of the Act, do not find any substance in the same.
4.  In that view of the matter, we see no justification for our interference with the impugned order of eviction. The SLPs. are accordingly dismissed.
5.  The learned counsel for the petitioner, however, prays that some time be given to the tenant-petitioner to deliver vacant possession of the premises to the landlord-respondents. The learned counsel for the respondents states that she has no objection to the same.
6.  Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case, we direct that the tenant petitioner shall deliver vacant possession of the premises to the landlord respondents on or before 31st May, 2002 subject to usual undertaking being filed in this Court within four weeks from today.
Petitions Dismissed.
