Lok Nath v State of Haryana
Supreme Court of India

15 January 1987
C.A. No. 95 of 1987 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 5899 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Special leave granted.
2. It appears from the facts before us that the services of the appellant were terminated because it was believed that he had deliberately attempted to commit theft. The case is one where an enquiry should have been held before terminating the appellant's services. Admittedly no such enquiry was held.
3. The learned District Judge was right in decreeing the suit for declaration and the High Court has erred, in our opinion, in reversing that decree. We accordingly set aside the judgment and order dated February 4, 1986 made by the High Court and restore the judgment and decree dated January 22, 1985 of the first appellate court.
4. The appeal is allowed with costs.
Appeal allowed.
