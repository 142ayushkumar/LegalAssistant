The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  Pursuant to our order dated 28-11-1992 the Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court has nominated Shri Tej Shankar, District Judge, Moradabad as Observer to monitor the situation in Ayodhya. There is a communication from the Observer to the Registrar (G) of this Court which is placed before us. There appears to be some problem of accommodation and other facilities to the Observer to enable him to effectuate his Commission. Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of Uttar Pradesh straight away assured us that every facility by way of a residential accommodation for the Observer, provision for his security of his choice, transport, and secretarial assistance of his choice either from the High Court or from such other source as he may deem proper, will be provided so as to enable him to discharge his duties. An imprest amount of Rs 3000 shall be made available to him. He shall also be provided with a means of telegraphic communication by way of telex, fax, telephone and wireless. Depending upon the urgency of the situation the Observer may employ any of the means for submitting his reports to the Registrar (G) of this Court. The Registrar shall place before the Judges the reports as and when received and the reports shall also be made available to the learned Attorney General, Shri K.K. Venugopal, Shri O.R Sharma and Shri Gobinda Mukhoty, learned Senior Advocates.
