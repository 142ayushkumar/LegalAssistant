Supreme Court of India

3 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7429/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  Considering the long delay in disposal of eviction petition filed and the reasons recorded by the High Court in remanding the matter, it is agreed by the learned counsel that instead of remanding the matter to the Rent Controller, let the matter be decided by the High Court on merits by exercising its revisional jurisdiction.
2. In this view of the matter, the impugned order passed by the High Court is set aside. High Court is requested to decide the matter on merits as early as possible.
3.  The appeal stands disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
