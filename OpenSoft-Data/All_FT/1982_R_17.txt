Sudama Prasad Sah v Ram Singhason Choudhry and Others
Supreme Court of India

8 December 1982
C.A. No. 3523 of 1982 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 9 April 1982 of the Patna High Court in Civil Revision No. 1344 of 1981).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
This is an appeal against the order passed by the High Court in revision setting aside an order of the trial court allowing amendment the plaint in a suit for specific performance filed by the appellant against the respondents. It is true that the High Court ordinarily should not interfere in revision with an order passed by the subordinate court allowing an amendment and in this case the amendment only sought to introduce an express averment of readiness and willingness to carry out his part of the contract and it will be for the trial court to decide whether such argument is valid or not.
1. In the circumstances we reject the appeal with no order as to costs.
Appela dismissed.
