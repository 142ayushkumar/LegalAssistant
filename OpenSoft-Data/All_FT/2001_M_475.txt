Ram Lakshman Sharma Pancham Singh v Most. Badami Devi and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 December 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.13237/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  We have heard learned counsel. We are satisfied that the judgment and order under appeal needs to be set aside and the appeal remanded to the High Court to be heard and disposed of afresh. This is for the reason that the judgment and order under appeal sets aside the judgment and order of the First Appellate Court without any indication of the formulation of a substantial question of law and without any assessment of the material on record. The two paragraphs which, at best, may be said to deal with the merits are wholly insufficient.
2.  Accordingly, the civil appeal is allowed. The order under appeal is set aside. The second appeal [Appeal from Appellate Decree No. 111 of 1992 (R)] is restored to the file of the High Court at Jharkhand to be heard and disposed of on merits. This shall be done with reference to the order that we have passed and without reference to the order which we have set aside.
This shall also be done expeditiously. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
