Cr.A. No. 364 of 1978 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 23 March 1978 of the Kerala High Court of Judicature at Ernakulam in Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 859 of 1977).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In view of the admitted fact that the 1st respondent has remarried on January 17, 1981, it is unnecessary for us to decide the interesting questions of law that have been raised in this appeal. Under the Original Order in M.C. 71/74 the 1st respondent is entitled to get maintenance for herself at the rate of Rs 50 per month which in view of the remarriage would be payable only up to January 17, 1981 and nothing thereafter. Her maintenance up to that date will have to be paid at the said rate subject to credit being given for all the amounts that have been paid in between by the appellant to the 1st respondent and subject to further credit being given for Rs 2000, an amount which is lying in civil court which the 1st respondent is given liberty to withdraw forthwith. Any balance, after credit is given as aforesaid must be paid by the appellant to the 1st respondent. As regards the child's maintenance at the rate of Rs 30 per month the same will be continued to the paid by the appellant so long as the child's custody remains with the 1st respondent.
2.  This will dispose of the appeal. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
