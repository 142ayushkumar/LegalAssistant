Union of India v Messrs M. Muljee
Supreme Court of India

3 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12051/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Respondent is in caveat, and Mr. Ray is appearing for the respondent.
2. Having heard the learned Additional Solicitor General for the Union of India and Mr. Ray for the respondent, we see no justification on the part of the Arbitrator to award cost of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rs. Two Lakh).
3.  We therefore set aside that part of the award awarding cost of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rs. Two Lakh), and appeal is allowed to that extent.
Appeal partly allowed.
