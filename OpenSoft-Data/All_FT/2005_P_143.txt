National Insurance Company Limited v Puja Roller Flour Mills (Private) Limited and others
Supreme Court of India

13 April 2005
C.A. No. 6548 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (for short the Tribunal) by its award dated 15-9-1994 fixed the compensation at Rs. 6,72,000/- and directed that as according to the terms of the insurance policy the liability of the Insurance Company was limited to the extent of Rs. 1,50,000/-, the claimants shall be entitled to recover a sum of Rs 1,50,000/- only from the Insurance Company and the balance amount of Rs. 5,22,000/- from the owner of the vehicle. Against the said order, the owner of the vehicle filed an appeal before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana giving rise to First Appeal No. 303 of 1995, in which the High Court upheld the quantum of compensation but directed that liability of the Insurance Company could not have been limited to Rs. 1,50,000/- but the same was an unlimited one. Thereafter, the Insurance Company filed a letters patent appeal before the High Court which has been dismissed. Hence, this appeal by special leave.
2.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that according to the terms of the insurance policy the liability of the Insurance Company was to the extent of Rs. 1,50,000/- in accordance with the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (hereinafter referred to as the old Act) but now, under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the new Act) the liability of the Insurance Company is unlimited. It has been submitted that in cases where the insurance policy issued under the old Act was subsisting on the date of passing of the new Act, a special provision has been made under the proviso to Section 147(2) of the new Act which lays down that if any policy of insurance issued with any limited liability and in force, immediately before the commencement of this Act, the same shall continue to be effective for a period of four months after such commencement or till the date of expiry of such policy whichever is earlier. the new Act came into force on 1-7-1989 and the accident had taken place on 29-9-1989 on which date the policy was effective.
3.  As the accident has taken place within the period of four months and the policy was to expire thereafter, the date of accident being earlier one in point of time, according to the proviso, the policy issued under the old Act shall continue to be effective in the case in hand. Thus, in view of the proviso the liability of the appellant Insurance Company would be limited to a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- only.
4.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned orders passed by the Division Bench as well as the learned Single Judge of the High Court directing that liability of the Insurance Company shall be unlimited are set aside and order passed by the Tribunal limiting the liability of the Insurance Company to Rs. 1,50,000/- is restored. It is needless to say that the Insurance Company shall be liable to recover the amount in excess of Rs. 1,50,000/- paid by it to the claimants from the owner of the vehicle. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
