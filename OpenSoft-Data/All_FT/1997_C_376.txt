Committee of Management J.T.G. Degree College v Vice-Chancellor Allahabad University and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 August 1997
Civil Appeal No. 5558 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Leave granted.
2. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
3. In clause (c) of paragraph 18.10 of the statutes of the University of Allahabad, it is indicated that the seniority of the principals and teachers of the associated colleges shall be on the basis of the length of service accruing from the date of appointment in substantive capacity. Clause (d) of the said paragraph further indicates that service in each capacity, for an example as principal or as a teacher shall be counted from the date of taking charge pursuant to substantive appointment. In the instant case, letter of appointment of the respondent was issued on 24.2.1987 and it has not been held by the High Court that the respondent will be deemed to have been appointed from any date prior to the date of appointment.
4. The seniority of the respondent, therefore, is to take effect from the date of her appointment as approved by the Vice-Chancellor read with clause (d) of paragraph 18.10. Therefore, the order of the High Court cannot be sustained.
The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
Appeal disposed of
