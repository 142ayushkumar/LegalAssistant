1. Leave granted.
2. The question in this batch of appeals is whether the Appellate Tribunal under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act,2002 ("the SARFAESI Act") has the power to condone delay infiling an appeal u/s. 18(1) of the said Act.
3. We have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties,including S/Shri Amol Chitale and Akshat Shrivastava, counselfor the appellants-borrowers and Shri Rana Mukherjee, seniorcounsel and S/Shri Anil Kumar Sangal and Pranab Kumar Mullick, counsel appearing for the Banks.
4. The appellants submit that the Appellate Tribunal has thepower to condone delay in filing the appeal beyond by theprescribed period of limitation because of the following reasons:
(i) S. 18(2) of the SARFAESI Act provides that the Appellate Tribunal shall follow the provisions of the Recovery ofDebts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 ("the RDB Act") in disposing of the appeal unless other wise provided under the SARFAESI Act or therules made thereunder. The proviso toS. 20(3) of the RDB Act empowers the Appellate Tribunal to enterta in an appeal after expiry of period of limitation, if sufficient cause for not filing the appeal within the period of limitation was shown. Thus, the proviso to S. 20(3) of the RDB Act is incorporated inS. 18(2) of the SARFAESI Act;
(ii) S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963makes the said Act's Ss. 4 to 24 applicable to a special or local law prescribing a different period oflimitation for a suit, appeal or application unless expressly excluded. There beingno provision in the SARFAESI Act excluding the applicability of Ss. 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act, delay can becondoned u/s. 5 of the Limitation Act, and time can be excluded u/s. 14 of the Limitation Act wherever applicable; and
(iii) S. 24 of the RDB Act makes the Limitation Act applicable to anapplication made to a Tribunal. S. 36 of the SARFAESI Act makes period oflimitation prescribed under the Limitation Act applicable to measures taken u/s. 13(4). Thus, there is be no exclusion of the Limitation Act.
5. On the other hand, the Banks would contend that:
(i) S. 18(2) of the SARFAESI Act cannot be read as extending provisions ofproviso to S. 20(3) of the RDB Act to an appeal filed u/s. 18(1) of the SARFAESI Act;
(ii) S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act is not attracted to proceedings before aTribunal as the period of limitation prescribed under the Limitation Act is applicable only to proceedings before a Court and not before a Tribunal; and
(iii) Provisions of Limitation Act can stand excluded not only by an expressprovision of a local or special law butalso by necessary implication from the scheme of such local or special law. The scheme of the SARFAESI Act by making the Limitation Act expressly applicable tomeasures u/s. 13(4) of the Act impliedly excludes the said Act from appeals or other proceedings.
6. Learned counsel for the parties have brought to ournotice that the issue in question has been examined by the High Courts of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bombay and Madras. While Madhya Pradesh High Court in M/s. Seth Banshidhar Media Rice Mills Pvt. Ltd. vs. State Bank ofIndia AIR 2011 MP 205 held that delay in filing an appeal cannot be condonedby the Tribunal, the Andhra Pradesh High Court in SajidaBegum vs. State Bank of India AIR 2013 AP 24 2012 Indlaw AP 226, the Bombay High Court in UCO Bank, Mumbai vs. M/s. Kanji Manji Kothari and Co.,Mumbai 2008 (4) MhLj 424 2008 Indlaw MUM 81 and the Madras High Court in Punnu Swami vs.The Debts Recovery Tribunal 2009 (3) BJ 401 have taken contrary view.
7. At this stage it will be appropriate to reproduce the provisions of Ss. 18 and 36 of the SARFAESI Act, S. 20 and S. 24 of the RDB Act and S. 29 of theLimitation Act :
"Ss. 18 and 36 of the SARFAESI Act :18. Appeal to Appellate Tribunal
(1) Any person aggrieved, by any order made by the Debts Recovery Tribunal under section 17, may prefer an appeal along with such fee, as may be prescribed to anAppellate Tribunal within thirty days from the date of receipt of the order of Debts Recovery Tribunal:

Ss. 20 and 24 of the RDB Act :S. 20 Appeal to the Appellate Tribunal(1) Save as provided in subsection (2), any person aggrieved by an order made, ordeemed to have been made, by a Tribunal under this Act, may prefer an appeal to anAppellate Tribunal having jurisdiction in thematter.

Provided that the Appellate Tribunal mayentertain an appeal after the expiry of thesaid period of forty-five days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filingit within that period.
(4) On receipt of an appeal under sub-section(1), the Appellate Tribunal may, after givingthe parties to the appeal, an opportunity of being heard, pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit, confirming, modifying or settingaside the order appealed against.
(5) The Appellate Tribunal shall send a copy ofevery order made by it to the parties to theappeal and to the concerned Tribunal.
(6) The appeal filed before the AppellateTribunal under sub-s. (1) shall be dealtwith by it as expeditiously as possible andendeavour shall be made by it to dispose ofthe appeal finally within six months fromthe date of receipt of the appeal.
S. 24 Limitation-The provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963), shall, asfar as may be, apply to an application made to a Tribunal.
S. 29 of the Limitation Act
29. Savings-
(1) Nothing in this Act shall affect s. 25 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872).
(2) Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application a period of limitation different from the period prescribed by the Schedule, the provisions of s. 3 shall apply as if such periodwere the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained inss. 4 to 24 (inclusive) shall apply only in so far as,and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law.
(3) Save as otherwise provided in any law for the time being in force with respect to marriage and divorce, nothing in this Act shall apply to any suit or other proceeding under any such law.
(4) Ss. 25 and 26 and the definition of "easement" ins. 2 shall not apply to cases arising in the territories to which the Indian Easements Act, 1882 (5 of 1882), may for the time being extend."
8. The first point for consideration is the applicability of proviso to S. 20(3) of the RDB Act to the disposal of anappeal by the Appellate Tribunal u/s. 18(2) of the SARFAESI Act. A bare perusal of the said S. 18(2) makesit clear that the Appellate Tribunal under the SARFAESI Act hasto dispose of an appeal in accordance with the provisions of the RDB Act. In this respect, the provisions of the RDB Act stand in corporated in the SARFAESI Act for disposal of anappeal. Once it is so, we are unable to discern any reason asto why the SARFAESI Appellate Tribunal cannot entertain anappeal beyond the prescribed period even on being satisfied that there is sufficient cause for not filing such appeal within that period. Even if power of condonation of delay by virtue ofS. 29(2) of the Limitation Act were held not to beapplicable, the proviso to S. 20(3) of the RDB Act isapplicable by virtue of S. 18(2) of the SARFAESI Act. This interpretation is clearly borne out from the provisions of the two statutes and also advances the cause of justice. Unless thescheme of the statute expressly excludes the power of condonation, there is no reason to deny such power to a Appellate Tribunal when the statutory scheme so warrants.Principle of legislation by in corporation is well known and hasbeen applied inter alia in Ram Kirpal Bhagat vs. The State of Bihar(1969) 3 SCC 471 1969 Indlaw SC 378, Bolani Ores Ltd. vs. State of Orissa (1974) 2 SCC 777 1974 Indlaw SC 353,Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. vs. Union of India (1979) 2 SCC 529 1979 Indlaw SC 155 and Onkarlal Nandlal vs. State of Rajasthan (1985) 4 SCC 404 1985 Indlaw SC 148 relied upon on behalf of the appellants. We have thus no he sitation in holding that the Appellate Tribunal under the SARFAESI Act has the power to condone the delay in filing an appeal before it by virtue of S. 18(2) SARFAESI Act and proviso to S.20(3) of the RDB Act.
9. The fact that RDB Act and the SARFAESI Act are complimentary to each other, as held by this Court inTranscore vs. Union of India (2008) 1 SCC 125 2006 Indlaw SC 900, also supports this view.
10. We may now deal with the conflicting views of the High Courts on the subject. The Madhya Pradesh High Court hasheld that the power of condonation of delay stood excluded by principle of interpretation that if a later statute has providedfor shorter period of limitation without express provision forcondonation, it could be implied that there was no power of condonation. Reliance has been placed on principles of statutory interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 12th Edition,2010, page 310. It was further observed that the LimitationAct was made applicable to a Tribunal under S. 24 of theRDB Act, but there was no similar provision with respect to the Appellate Tribunal. To justify such an inference, reliance hasalso been placed on Gopal Sardar case and Fair growth Investments Ltd. vs. The Custodian (2004) 11 SCC 472 2004 Indlaw SC 868. It was further observed that the object of SARFAESI Act was to ensurespeedy recovery of the dues and quicker resolution of disputes arising out of action taken for recovery of such dues. We find the approach to be erroneous and incorrect understanding ofthe principle of interpretation which has been relied upon. The principle discussed in the celebrated Treatise in question is as follows:
"When an amending Act alters the languageof the principal statue, the alteration must betaken to have been made deliberately."
11. It is difficult to appreciate how the above principlejustifies the view of the High Court. The change intended in SARFAESI Act has to be seen from the statute and not from beyond it. No doubt the period of limitation for filing appeal u/s. 18 of the SARFAESI Act is 30 days as against 45 days under S. 20 of the RDB Act. To this extent, legislative intent may be deliberate. The absence of anexpress provision for condonation, when S. 18(2)expressly adopts and incorporates the provisions of the RDB Act which contains provision for condonation of delay in filing of an appeal, cannot be read as excluding the power of condonation. As already observed, the proviso to S.20(3) which provides for condonation of delay (45 days under RDB Act) stands extended to disposal of appeal under the SARFAESI Act (to the extent that condonation is of delaybeyond 30 days). There is no reason to exclude the proviso toS. 20(3) in dealing with an appeal under the SARFAESIAct. Taking such a view will be nullifying S. 18(2) of the SARFAESI Act. We are thus, unable to uphold the view taken by the Madhya Pradesh High Court.
12. We approve the view taken by the Madras, Andhra Pradesh and Bombay High Courts, but for different reasons.The view taken by Andhra Pradesh High Court in SajidaBegum vs. State Bank of India AIR 2013 AP 24 2012 Indlaw AP 226 is based on applicability of S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act. In our view, S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act has no absolute application, as the statutein question impliedly excludes applicability of provisions of Limitation Act to the extent a different scheme is adopted. If noprovision of Limitation Act was expressly adopted, it may havebeen possible to hold that by virtue of S. 29(2) power ofcondonation of delay was available. It is well settled thatexclusion of power of condonation of delay can be implied aslaid down in Union of India vs. Popular ConstructionCo. (1995) 5 SCC 5 1995 Indlaw SC 1785, Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board vs. CentralElectricity Regulatory Commission (2010) 5 SCC 23 2010 Indlaw SC 269, Commissioner ofCustoms and Central Excise vs. Hongo India PrivateLimited (2009) 5 SCC 791 2009 Indlaw SC 800 and Gopal Sardar vs. Karuna Sardar (2004) 4 SCC 252 2004 Indlaw SC 192 reliedupon on behalf of the Banks.
13. We may now advert to the last question as to whether the Appellate Tribunal under the SARFAESI Act was not a Court and therefore, S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act was notattracted.
14. The Andhra Pradesh High Court in Sajida Begum case in holding the Tribunal to be Court, has relied on Ss. 22 and24 of the RDB Act. S. 22 vests powers of Civil Court onthe Tribunal only for purposes mentioned therein, such assummoning witnesses, discovery and production of documents, receiving evidence, issuing commission forexamining witnesses etc. and deems Tribunals to be courts for specified purposes, such as for Sections 193, 196 and 228 ofthe Indian Penal Code and S. 195 of the Criminal Procedure Code. These provisions may not be conclusive of the question of the Tribunal being Court for S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act without further examining the scheme of thestatutes in question. In Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd.vs. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corpn. (2009) 8 SCC 646 2009 Indlaw SC 931, thisCourt examined the scheme of the two Acts in question andheld that the Tribunal was a court but not a civil court forpurposes of S. 24 of the CPC. We are of the view that forpurposes of decision of these appeals, it is not necessary todecide the question whether the Tribunal under the Banking statutes in question was court for purposes of S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act. We have already held that the power of condonation of delay was expressly applicable by virtue of S. 18(2) of the SARFAESI Act read with proviso to S.20(3) of the RDB Act and to that extent, the provisions of Limitation Act having been expressly incorporated under the special statutes in question, S. 29(2) stands impliedlyexcluded. To this extent, we differ with the view taken by the Andhra Pradesh High Court as well as Madras and Bombay High Courts. We are also in agreement with the principle thateven though S. 5 of the Limitation Act may be impliedlyinapplicable, principle of S. 14 of the Limitation Act canbe held to be applicable even if S. 29(2) of the Limitation Act does not apply, as laid down by this Court inConsolidated Engineering Enterprises vs. PrincipalSecretary, Irrigation Department (2008) 7 SCC 169 2008 Indlaw SC 668 and M.P. SteelCorporation vs. Commissioner of Central Excise (2015) 5 SCALE 505 .
15. As a result of the above discussion, the question isanswered in the affirmative by holding that delay in filing anappeal u/s. 18 (1) of the SARFAESI Act can becondoned by the Appellate Tribunal under proviso to S. 20(3) of the RDB Act read with S. 18 (2) of the SARFAESIAct. The contrary view taken by the Madhya Pradesh HighCourt in Seth Banshidhar Media Rice Mills Pvt. Ltd. caseis overruled.
16. Accordingly, the appeal filed by the Bank against the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court is dismissed andthe appeals filed by the borrowers are allowed. The impugnedorders passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh (inappeals arising out of SLP (C) No.27674 of 2011 and SLP (C)No.36316 of 2011) are set aside and the matters are remandedto the High Court for being dealt with afresh in accordancewith law. The appeal arising out of SLP (C) No.38436 of 2012 has been preferred directly from the order of the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Delhi passed by the said tribunal relying upon the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Courtin Seth Banshidhar Media Rice Mills Pvt. Ltd. case. Thesaid impugned order is also set aside and the matter isremanded to the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Delhi forbeing dealt with afresh in accordance with law.
17. All the appeals are disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of
