State of Punjab and Another v Amarjit Kaur
Supreme Court of India

1 November 1996
C.A. No. 14819 of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 16414 of 1996)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal by special leave arises from the order of the learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, dated 14-6-1995 in CR No. 2348 of 1995. The order of termination of service ultimately culminated in perpetual injunction whereby the appellant was directed to set aside the order of termination and to give the respondent consequential benefits. That order became final after the dismissal of the special leavepetition by this Court on 30-1-1989 in SLP (C) No. 13481 of 1988.
2.   Consequently, the appellants are required to pay all the consequential benefits as per the mandatory injunction granted by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court in the second appeal. As a consequence, though the appellants have some point for arguments, this Court cannot go into that question since constructive res judicata stands in their way.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
