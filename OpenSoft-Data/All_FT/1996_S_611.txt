State of Bihar and Others v Ramjee Ram
Supreme Court of India

8 January 1996
C.A. No. ... of 1996 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 20806 of 1995)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  In the All India Judges Assn. case All India Judges' Assn. v. Union of India, 1993 Indlaw SC 17121993 Indlaw SC 17121993 Indlaw SC 1712 in the concluding paragraph this Court had observed as under:
"Any clarification that may be required in respect of any matter arising out of this decision will be sought only from this Court and from no other court. Further, the proceedings, if any, for implementation of the directions given in this judgment shall be filed only in this Court and no other court shall entertain them."
2.  In view of this clear direction in the aforesaid case, we are afraid that the High Court was not right in exercising jurisdiction. We, therefore, set aside the order of the High Court.
However, if any part of the direction given by this Court in the aforesaid case has not been complied with, it would be open to move this Court, if so advised. The appeal will stand disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
