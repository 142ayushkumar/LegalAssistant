Brij Lal Yadav v Sharda Sharma and another
Supreme Court of India

8 April 2005
C.A. No. 2487 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 22194 of 2004)
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave granted.
1.  The trial court granted eviction under Section 14-D of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 (for short "the Act"), which order has been confirmed by the High Court by dismissing the revision application filed by the tenant.  Hence, this appeal by special leave.
2.  Undisputedly, the landlord, who is a widow, never inducted the tenant, nor was he inducted by her husband. It has been laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Nathi Devi v. Radha Devi Gupta 2004 Indlaw SC 1066 disposed of on 17-12-2004, that the provision of Section 14-D of the Act would only apply in those cases where either widow or her husband had let out the building in question.
3. As in the present case, there is neither such case nor affidavits, therefore, eviction petition under Section 14-D of the Act is fit to be dismissed.
4.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, impugned orders are set aside and the eviction petition stands dismissed. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
