Bapurao and Others v State of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

3 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Cr.) No. 2609/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Admittedly petitioners' appeal against conviction and sentence is still pending in the High Court. Bail has been refused on 10th July, 2001.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that even if prosecution story is accepted as established, the offence would not fall under Section 306 IPC. He submits that in view of the period already spent in jail, the petitioners be released on bail.
3.  It is open to the petitioners to approach the High Court again and urge all such pleas. We are not inclined to interfere with the interim order at this stage.
The special leave petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
