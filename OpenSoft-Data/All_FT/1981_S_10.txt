Sachindra Mohan Das Gupta v Governor of Tripura
Supreme Court of India

3 November 1981
Civil appeal No. 1552 of 1970.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we find that the compensation awarded for the requisition of the land in dispute has no legal basis to justify it. It was awarded at six per cent of the market value of the land which was later acquired. That is not a basis sanctioned by law.
2. On the other hand, the compensation should have been determined in accordance with the provisions of cl. (c) of sub-s. (3) of s. 29 of the West Bengal Security Act, 1950 and of sub-s. (8) thereof having regard to the criteria enunciated therein.
3.  We are of the opinion that in order to have the compensation determined in accordance with law and expeditiously it is necessary for this Court to appoint a Commissioner. Learned counsel for the parties are agreed that Shri S. B. Laskar retired District Judge, Agartala may be so appointed. We order accordingly.
4. The parties shall appear before him on November 25, 1981 along with their respective statements of the case regarding compensation and shall submit the same to him on that date. He shall then proceed with the investigation, examine witnesses and do all other things which may be necessary and lawful for arriving at the compensation in accordance with the above criteria. He shall prepare his report expeditiously and submit it to this Court by February 15, 1982 at the latest.
5.  The remuneration of the Commissioner shall be Rs. 5000 in addition to a sum of Rs. 500 for out-of-pocket expenses by way of engaging a typist, etc., to be paid by the parties to this appeal half and half.
6.  Case to be listed for hearing before this Court in the third week of February 1982 at the top of the list as part-heard.
