A.P.S.R.T.C v Gurram Buchamma and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.12599/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the court shall not grant anything more than Rs.5,000/- towards loss of consortium and in that place a sum of Rs.30,000/- has been granted under two counts. This matter does not appear to have been considered by the High Court and therefore the petitioner would be advised to file a review petitioner before the High Court. For enabling the learned counsel to advice the petitioner to move such a review petition before the High Court learned counsel seeks permission to withdraw this Special Leave Petition.
Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed as withdrawn.
Petition dismissed.
