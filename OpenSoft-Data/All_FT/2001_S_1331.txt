Supreme Court of India

14 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14577/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Heard Mr.RF Nariman, learned senior counsel for the petitioners and Mr.CS Vaidyanathan, learned senior counsel for the caveator/respondents.
2.  With regad to the same subject matter the parties are litigating in different courts. Whereas the petitioners' Civil Suit No.961/2000 is pending in the High Court of Madras (out of which this S.L.P. arises), the suit filed by the respondents being O.S.No.1440/2001 2 is pending in the Court of City Civil Judge, Bangalore.
3.  The learned counsel for the parties have agreed that the suit pending in the High Court of Madras be transferred for being tried along with the said suit pending in the City Civil Court, Bangalore. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, in the interest of justice, we are inclined to grant this relief.
4. We accordingly order that Civil Suit No.961/2000 pending in the High Court of Madras be transferred to the Court of City Civil Judge, Bangalore for being tried with O.S.No.1440/2001 pending on the file of his Court. The learned City Civil Judge, Bangalore is directed to dispose of both the suits within six months from the date of the receipt of the records from the High Court of Madras.
5.  In so far as the order under challenge is concerned we do not find any justifiable reason warranting our interference. Subject to above direction, the S.L.P. is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
