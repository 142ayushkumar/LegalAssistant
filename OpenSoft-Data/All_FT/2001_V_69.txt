Vidya Kant Tiwari v M.P. Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.1413/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Pursuant to the order of the Court dated 9th February,2001, the Secretary, U.P. Higher Education Service Commission has submitted a report. The delay in finalising the selection process appears to be on account of the orders of the High Court. We are informed that after hearing arguments in two writ petitions, judgment has been reserved but has not so far been delivered.
2. Under these circumstances, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned orders of the Division Bench. The special leave petitions are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
