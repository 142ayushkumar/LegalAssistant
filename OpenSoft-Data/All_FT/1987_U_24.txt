Supreme Court of India

22 January 1987
Writ Petition (C) Nos. 13748-84 of 1984.
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  It is not disputed that the Air-conditioned Coach In- charges Attendants are being paid overtime allowances for extra duty hours exceeding 96 hours in two weeks in the Western Railway, Central Railway and Eastern Railway. There is no justification for denying overtime allowances on the same basis to the Air-conditioned Coach In charges Attendants in the Northern Railway. We accordingly direct the Union of India and the Railway Administration to pay with effect from July 1, 1984 the overtime allowance to the Air-conditioned Coach In charges-Attendants working in the Northern Railway on the same basis on which the Air-conditioned Coach In-charges-Attendants in the other three Railways, referred to above, are paid. All arrears of such allowances up to date shall be paid as early as possible as and in any event not later than four months from today. The benefit of this order shall be extended to all such employees including those who have retired and those who have not joined as petitioners herein.
The Writ Petitions are allowed. No costs. Petitions allowed.
