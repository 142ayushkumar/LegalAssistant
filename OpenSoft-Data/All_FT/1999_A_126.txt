Arulmighu Lakshminarasimhaswamy Temple v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

11 October 1999
IA No. 1 in C.A. No. 12001 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is an application filed by the Government of Pondicherry for clarification of the order dated 2-9-1996 in disposing of Civil Appeal No. 12001 of 1996. While disposing of the civil appeal, a direction had been given by this Court to make a reference u/s. 30 of the Land Acquisition Act.
2.  It has been brought to our notice now that in fact such reference had already been made in which Lakshminarasimhaswamy Temple was also a party and that application u/s. 30 has also been disposed of.
3. The Court, obviously, cannot direct to make a further reference u/s. 30 and obviously the aforesaid direction had been given not being aware of the fact that a reference already had been made u/s. 30 as is apparent from the impugned judgment.
4.  In that view of the matter, our direction in the civil appeal to the effect that reference be made u/s. 30 is recalled.
IA is disposed of.
Application disposed of.
