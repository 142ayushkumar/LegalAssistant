Babar Ali v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 November 1999
S.L.P. (C) No. 15684 of 1999 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 24 September 1999 in CW.P. No. 5821 of 1999 of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We find that there is no question of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 being unconstitutional or in any way offending the basic structure of the Constiiution of India, as the High Court has rightly observed that judicial review is available for challenging the award in accordance with the procedure laid down therein.
Only because the question of jurisdiction of the Arbitrator is required to be considered after the award is passed and not at any penultimate stage by the appropriate court, it cannot be a ground for submitting that such an order is not subject to any judicial scrutiny.
2. The time and manner of judicial scrutiny can legitimately be laid down by the Act passed by Parliament. The challenge to the vires of the Act was rightly rejected by the High Court. We fully endose that view.
The special leave petition is dismissed
Petition dismissed.
