Hmm Coaches Limited v Messrs Jaycee Coach Builders Limited and Others
Supreme Court of India

13 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.7902/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner urged that the Court below was not legally justified in granting injunction to the plaintiff-respondents at least when it was open to them to sue for liquidating damages for a sum of Rs.1 crore under the agreement.
2. However, this contention is not dealt with in the judgment under challenge although appears to have been raised before the High Court.
3.  Mr.F.S. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing for respondent Nos. 1-5 contends that even if the contention raised has not been dealt with by the High Court, the grant of injunction being discretionary, the Court below having granted discretionary relief in view of the fraud played upon by the defendant-petitioner, this Court should not interfere in the matter under Art. 136 of the Constitution.
4.  We have considered the matter and we are of the view that the petitioner may be allowed to file a review petition before the High Court.
5.  In case review petition is filed, the question of limitation will not come in the way of the petitioner and the High Court shall decide the said review petition in accordance with law.
6.  However, it will be open to the respondents to raise such plea, as it may be available to them under law for grant of injunction order.
In the aforesaid terms, the special leave petition stands disposed of.
Petition disposed of.
