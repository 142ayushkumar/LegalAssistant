People for Ethical Treatment of Animals v Union of India and others
Supreme Court of India

2  May  2005
W.P. (Civil) No. 44 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, in the affidavit dated 24th March, 2005, has sought additional three months' time to take appropriate action in regard to the consideration of the proposal of the Animal Welfare Board of India [for short, "the Board"] for appointing State level forest officers as officers empowered under Rule 9(1) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Slaughter House) Rules, 2000, to inspect the slaughter houses. Prima facie, we tend to agree with the submissions made by Mr. Raj Panjwani, learned counsel, about the problems likely to arise if forest officers are empowered under Rule 9 (1) of the Rules.
Further, some of the States, as noticed in the affidavit dated 24th March, 2005, have reservations about such authorisation in favour of the forest officers. We direct the Ministry to consider expeditiously as to the proper person or authority, who may be empowered to inspect the slaughter houses under Rule 9(1) of the Rules. The Ministry shall file affidavit by 15th July, 2005. In the meanwhile, we direct the Board, which is situated in Chennai, to at least inspect the main slaughter houses in the State of Tamil Nadu and file its inspection report. The Board is empowered to inspect the slaughter houses under Rule 9(1) of the Rules. This aspect has also been mentioned in the order dated 1st November, 1994.
2. List the writ petition in the month of August, 2005.
Order accordingly
