Messrs P.N. Writer and Company Limited v Standard Chartered Bank
Supreme Court of India

21 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.14827/2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  During the course of the hearing, this Court's attention was drawn to paragraph 29 of the counter affidavit filed in this special leave petition which records that respondents have already removed all the records from the premises pursuant to the direction of the High Court. In that view of the matter it appears, and both Mr. Nariman and Mrs.Jaisingh concurs, that the matter has become infructuous. The special leave petition, thus, stands disposed of as being infructuous.
2. Let it, however, be placed on record that we have not gone into the merits of the matter and as such we are not expresssing any opinion in regard thereto. The other suit which is said to be pending and the petition together with notice of motion as such be dealt with on its own merits, uninfluenced by any orders passed in the present proceedings.
3.  The order of status quo passed by this Court, however, shall stand vacated and parties would be at liberty to take steps in accordance with the law.
The special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
