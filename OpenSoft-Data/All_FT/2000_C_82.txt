Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board v Omi Khandelwal and Others
Supreme Court of India

30 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.19760/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Taken on Board.
Heard.
Leave granted.
1.  We are of the view that this ex-parte stay order on a public interest litigation ought not to have been passed. We decline to go into greater detail because we are told that the matter is to appear on the board of a Division Bench, after notice. The Division Bench can now hear the matter and pass appropriate orders.
The appeal is allowed. The order under challenge is set aside.
No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
