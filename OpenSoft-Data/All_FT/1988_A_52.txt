Ashok Kumar v Union of India and Another
Supreme Court of India

22 March 1988
S.L.P. (C) No. 4053/87,
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. Special leave granted.
2. Heard learned counsel for parties.
3. In the facts and circumstances of the matter we are of the view that the punishment imposed is grossly disproportionate to the charge which was to the effect that the appellant had absented himself from duty for three days without leave. For the same, the punishment of termination of service was certainly not at all warranted. Taking into consideration all the aspects which are available before us we set aside the impugned order of termination of service and in its place a punishment of censure to be entered in the service record be substituted.
4. We accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the decision of Central Administrative Tribunal and restore the decree made by the Munsif subject to the modifications indicated above.
5. Appeal is allowed. No costs.
Appeal allowed.
