V. Purushotham Rao v Union of India and Others
Supreme Court of India

10 October 2001
C.As. 3102& 3086/00 Mr. P.N. Misra, Sr. Adv. Mr. S.R. Bhat, Adv. Mr. R.K. Kapoor, Mr. B R Kapoor, Advs. for Mr. Anis Ahmed Khan, Adv
The Order of the Court was as follows:
W.P. (C) no. 577/99.
Heard Mr. Bachawat, learned senior counsel for the petitioner.
1. This is a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution of India against an order of cancellation of the discretionary allotment made in favour of the petitioner by the High Court of Delhi. The petitioner had also approached this Court earlier by way of S.L.Ps. arising out of CC Nos. 5762-67/99 which stood dismissed on the ground of delay. The self-same order of the Delhi High Court is assailed now by filing this petition under Art. 32.
2.  We are not inclined to invoke our jurisdiction under Art. 32 of the Constitution of India, as in our view in a matter like this, the earlier order of dismissal of the SLP concludes the matter. If the SLP itself was dismissed on the ground of delay, we see no reason why a petition under Art.32 could be entertained after this length of time. This petition accordingly stands dismissed.
WP(C) Nos. 396 and 111 of 2000
Heard Mr. Mohta and Mr. G.L. Sanghi, learned senior 4 counsel for the petitioners, and Mr. P.N. Misra for respondent no. 4 and Mr. T.L.V. Iyer for the Union of India.
3.  Having regard to the facts that the self same order which has been the subject matter of challenge in these writ petitions under Article 32 was under challenge before this Court in SLPs which stood dismissed and Review Petitions filed thereafter also stood dismissed, we are not inclined to entertain the writ petitions under Art. 32. They accordingly stand rejected.
4.  IA no.2 in WP 396/2000 for impleadment stands dismissed as not pressed.
C.A. Nos. 3100, 3104-3105, 3089, 3090, 3117, 3097, 3102 and 3086 of 2000.
Heard.
5. Judgment reserved. Rest of the matters be listed as part heard.
Order accordingly.
