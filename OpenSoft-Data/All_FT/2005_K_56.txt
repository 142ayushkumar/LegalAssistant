Kajol S. Chandiramani v Sanju Hiran and Chandiramani
Supreme Court of India

21 April 2005
Transfer Petition (C) No. 733 of 2004
The order of the court was as follows:
Heard parties.
1.  This is a wife's petition for transfer of Matrimonial Suit No. 50 of 2004 titled "Sanju Hiran and Chandiramani v. Kajol S. Chandiramani" from the Court of VIIth Additional District Judge, Alipore to the Family Court at Bangalore.
2.  Amongst other grounds it is stated that the wife has to look after a small three-year-old child. It is stated that it is difficult for the petitioner to leave her child and/or to take her child every time while going to Calcutta. The only objection taken is that the respondent is suffering from chronic epilepsy and is in constant need of medical supervision. It is claimed that it is not possible for him to travel for such a long distance.
We find from his matrimonial petition that the respondent has admitted that he had travelled to Bangalore and Darjeeling. We, therefore, see no substance in the submission that the respondent cannot travel. In our view, the respondent can travel along with a companion if he so desires.
3.  In our view, sufficient grounds have been made out by the petitioner for transfer of Matrimonial Suit No. 50 of 2004 titled "Sanju Hiranand Chandiramani v. Kajol S. Chandiramani" from the Court of VIIth Additional District Judge, Alipore to the Family Court at Bangalore.
We order accordingly. The transfer petition is allowed.
petition allowed.
