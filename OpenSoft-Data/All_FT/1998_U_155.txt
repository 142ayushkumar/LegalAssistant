W.P. (Cr.) No. 312 of 1994, with W.P. (C) No. 637 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
RECORD ON PROCEEDINGS
1.  In our order dated 25-11-1997 1997 Indlaw SC 1700  we were constrained to point out that in spite of a lapse of two years nothing has been done and therefore we were required to direct all the States to comply with the directions in all respects by 3-2-1998. Except the State of Orissa, none of the States have complied with the directions given in full. In fact this Court in the said order observed as follows:
"It is made clear that in the event of failure to comply with these directions, contempt proceedings will have to be initiated against the Chief Secretary of the State Government/Union Territory Administration concerned. An affidavit about compliance of these directions shall be filed on behalf of the State Governments/Union Territories by 3-2-1998."
2.  As pointed out, except State of Orissa, no other State/Union Territory has complied with our directions in full. Some excuses are sought to be given before us but we do not find any justification for accepting such lame excuses.
3.  Therefore, we direct the Registry to issue notices for contempt, except to State of Orissa, as directed in the order dated 25-11-1997  1997 Indlaw SC 1700 returnable by 5-5-1998.
4.  We give, in the meanwhile, time till 30-4-1998, to all the defaulting States/Union Territory Administrations to comply with in full the directions given by this Court on 25-11-1997  1997 Indlaw SC 1700  and file an affidavit to that effect one week before 30-4-1998. If by that time the directions in full and in all respects are complied with, the notices now issued for contempt may be treated as withdrawn otherwise the Chief Secretaries of State Government/Union Territory Administration concerned shall have to appear before this Court in person on 5-5-1998 and answer the notice for contempt.
5.  The contempt notices be issued to all the Chief Secretaries of States/Union Territory Administrations concerned except the State of Orissa.
WP (C) No. 637 of 1997
Adjourned to 5-5-1998.
Order accordingly.
