Prashant Kamlakar Vinde v The State Of Maharashtra
Supreme Court of India

17 December 2008
CRIMINAL APPEAL No.2059 OF 2008 [Arising out of SLP(Crl.)No.4419 of 2008]
The Order of the Court was as follows :
Leave granted.
1.  This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the Bombay High Court, rejecting the appellant's prayer for grant of bail, in connection with Cr.8/2007, pending before the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Raigarh, Alibagh.
2.  Having heard learned counsel for the respective parties, and since it appears from the materials on record that the appellant's prayer for bail was refused only on the ground that he has been identified during the identification parade held, and also having regard to the fact that the trial has not proceeded and the appellant is in custody since 20/04/2007, let him be released on bail to the satisfaction of the trial court.
3.  At the same time, we request the learned Sessions Judge to complete the trial expeditiously.
The appeal is disposed of.
