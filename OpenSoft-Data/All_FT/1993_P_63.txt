Prem Kumari And Another v U.T. Admn., Chandigarh And Others
Supreme Court of India

20 September 1993
S.L.P. (Civil) Nos. 14552-57 of 1993 (From the Judgment and Order Dt. 27 July 1993 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in CW.P. Nos. 12518 of 1992, 13836 of 1991, 12989 of 1992, 13837 of 1991, 4587 of 1992 and 10703 of 1990)
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1.  The petitioners are admittedly daughters-in-law of the retired employees. The U.T., Chandigarh had introduced the scheme for allotment of out of turn accommodation to the wife/husband, son, unmarried daughter of the retired employees to remain in occupation of the allotted quarters on paying fixed rentals. Therein, initially, daughter-in-law was also included but later she was deleted from the category of the persons entitled to the out of turn allotment. It was challenged in the High Court. In the impugned judgment in C.W. No. 10703 of 1990,dated 27-7- 1993, the High Court held that the deletion of daughter-in-law from the scheme is well justified. The correctness thereof is now assailed in these special leave petitions.
2.  Shri D.V. Sehgal, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners contended that when son, unmarried daughter and wife/husband are treated as eligible for out of turn allotment, daughter-in-law, who became part of the house of father-in-law/mother-in-law, is also entitled to the parity of the treatment. We find no force in the contention. The government quarters are to be allotted on the basis of seniority and deviation should be on the basis of valid and discernible differentiation.
3.  Otherwise, it is open to challenge on the ground of invidious discrimination. Policy decision of the administration is that daughter-in-law is not entitled to parity of treatment. Under these circumstances, we find no justifiable reason warranting interference as we cannot sit over the policy and we find no merit in the contention. The special leave petitions are accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed
