Syed Naseem Ahmed v Mohd. Abdul Hakeem (Dead) By Lrs. and others
Supreme Court of India

17 February 2005
C.A. No. 7346 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the arguing counsel makes a request for adjourning the matter on the ground that the counsel had to leave Delhi to attend an ailing member of his family.
2.  Learned counsel for the respondents, however, points out that as far back as on 30-10-2000, it was reported on behalf of his client to this Court that his landlord has already taken the possession of the leased premises on 8-9-2000. The counsel for the appellant thereafter was granted two weeks' time to take instructions and report to this Court. No further response in writing was submitted by the appellant who claims to be the tenant in the leased premises.
3.  In the aforesaid circumstances, we find no ground to just adjourn this matter. On the statement made by the counsel for the respondent, the appeal is dismissed.
4. In case the statement is found to be untrue, it is open to the appellant to apply for restoration of the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.
