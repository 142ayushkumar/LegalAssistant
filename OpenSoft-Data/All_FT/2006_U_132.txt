Union of India and another v Bhavna Engineering Company
Supreme Court of India

14 September 2006
C.A. No. 3736 of 2005
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The challenge in this appeal is to the order dated 11-1-2005 of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior passed in Writ Petition No. 1106 of 2004 affirming the order of the Sixth Additional District Judge, Gwalior dismissing the Section 34 application as being barred by limitation. Both the Additional District Judge and the High Court have held that Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, (in short "the Act"), is not applicable in arbitral proceedings.
2.  This Court in a recent judgment rendered in State of Goa v. Western Builders 2006 Indlaw SC 291 held that Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable in the arbitration and conciliation proceedings. Having gone through the various facts, we are of the view that the mistake committed by the appellant in approaching the Madhya Pradesh High Court and the Bombay High Court is bona fide.
3. We, therefore, condone the delay. In the facts of this case and in the interest of justice, we, however, think it proper that the Section 34 application pending before the Additional District Judge, Gwalior be transferred to the Bombay High Court. The application will be decided on merits expeditiously. Parties are at liberty to urge all the contentions before that Court.
Interim order passed by this Court shall continue for six months.
With the aforesaid direction, the appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
