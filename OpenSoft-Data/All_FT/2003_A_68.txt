C.A. No. 1916 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This application is filed by the third appellant seeking a direction to the respondents to comply with the compromise decree dated 18.1.2001 in Civil Appeal No. 1916 of 1996. The applicant has sought for a further direction onto the respondents
"to leave and surrender three bighas of land for the graveyard in favour of the applications in CA 1916/96 from the land in dispute as per the marking in the map which was signed by all the parties and annexed to the agreed compromise deed dated 18.1.2001"
2.  On 2.9.2002, this Court recorded that as there was a dispute between the parties whether the terms of the compromise had been complied with or not the District Judge, Jyotiba Phule Nagar, was directed to decide the issue. The applicant was given liberty to file an application before the District Judge indicating his grievance within two weeks. The respondents were granted liberty to file their response to the same. The report was directed to be submitted by the District Judge within four months thereafter.
3.  Pursuant to the order dated 2.9.2002, the District Judge has submitted the report. Let copies of the report be made available to each of the parties. It appears to us that what the applicant seeks is execution of the compromise decree.
The mode of execution provided by the Civil Procedure Code must be followed. The application is, accordingly, disposed of by granting liberty to the parties to execute the compromise decree in the manner provided under the law.
4. It is made clear that the various contentions raised by both the parties in the present application are not decided by this Court.
Application disposed of.
