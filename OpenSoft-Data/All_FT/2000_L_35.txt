Sardar Makkhan Singh v Laxmi Narain Sharma and Others
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.337/1999
The order of the court was as follows:
Leave is granted.
Heard the learned counsel for the parties.
1.  This appeal is directed against the order of the High Court dated 27.10.1998 passed in CMWP 34232/98 declining to go into the merits of the case on the ground that the appellant herein did not express willingness to deposit the amount to be paid to the employees. A perusal of the order shows that by order dated March 7, 1998 the appellant was directed to pay Rs.52, 200/- as wages which had been illegally deducted and an equal amount as compensation together with cost of Rs.200/-. These amounts sum up to Rs.1, 04, 600/-.
2.  Out of this amount the appellant has deposited Rs.50, 000/- pursuant to the order of this Court. We grant eight weeks' time to the appellant to deposit the balance of the amount.
3.  On the amount being so deposited the order under challenge shall stand set aside, the writ petition restored to its file, the High Court shall then hear the writ petition and 2 decide the case on merits. We hastened to add that in the event of failure to deposit the amount within the specified period, the appeal shall stand dismissed. No costs.
Appeal dismissed.
