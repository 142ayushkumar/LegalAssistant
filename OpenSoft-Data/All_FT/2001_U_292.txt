Union of India v N.G. Kulkarni and Others
Supreme Court of India

4  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.8875/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard counsel for the parties and perused the record.
1.  We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the High Court that the order passed by the employer was punitive in nature and, therefore, this appeal fails.
2.  However, the quantum of compensation awarded by the High Court appears to be slightly excessive. We, therefore, modify the compensation from Rs.3 lacs to Rs.2 lacs.
With these directions, the appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
