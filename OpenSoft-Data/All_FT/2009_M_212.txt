Supreme Court of India

11  May  2009
C.A. No.3475 of 2009 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (C) No.11113 of 2007) With C.A. No.3476 of 2009 @ S.L.P. (C) No.11750 of 2007
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  These appeals are directed against orders dated 8th March and 15th March, 2007 passed by the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in Writ Appeal Nos. 626/2007 and 507/2007 respectively, which were preferred by the appellants against common order dated 6.12.2006 passed by the learned Single Judge in Writ Petition Nos. 30169/2006 and 29770/2006.
2. The learned Single Judge disposed of the writ petitions and directed the Central Government to reconsider all the applications filed by Government Homeo Colleges at Trivandrum and Kozhikode and grant approval with retrospective effect, in case it came to the conclusion that approval can be granted, and regularize courses already commenced by the two colleges. The learned Single Judge also directed Vice Chancellors of the Universities to grant affiliation to the two courses with retrospective effect from 1st May, 2005 and conduct examination without delay. The Division Bench dismissed the appeals preferred by the appellants.
3.  A bare perusal of the impugned orders show that the same are non-speaking, inasmuch as issues raised by the appellants were not at all considered by the Division Bench.
4. In our view, where intricate issue like grant of approval to the colleges and/or courses was decided by the learned Single Judge, the Division Bench was obliged to decide the appeals on merits. The same having not been done, the impugned orders are liable to be set aside.
5.  The civil appeals are, accordingly, allowed, impugned orders are set aside and the matters are remitted to the High Court to decide the appeals afresh after giving opportunity of hearing to the parties.
Appeals allowed.
