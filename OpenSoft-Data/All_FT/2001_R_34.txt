Union of India and Others v R.K. Bansal and Anr
Supreme Court of India

19 July 2001
C.A. No(s). 12983/1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The original respondent was prematurely retired form service by an order made on 16.9.1994, to be effective from 20.9.1994 when he would have completed 30 years of service.
2.  He challenged before the Central Administrative Tribunal the said order on the basis of Rule 48 of the C.C.S. Pension Rules, 1992 ( hereinafter referred to as the Rule ). The said respondent contended that he could not have been retired from service by an order made on 16.9.1994 though it came to be effective from 20.9.1994 when he would have completed 30 years of service because according to the said respondent the retirement could be only on completion of 30 years of service and that occasion would arise only on 20.9.1994.
3.  The appellant contended before the Tribunal that the said Rule enable the concerned authority to require any public servant to retire in public interest under the relevant Rule on completion of 30 years of service which he completed on 20.9.1994. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the order.
4. However, the Tribunal accepted the contention putforth on behalf of respondent and set aside the order of retirement made by the appellant. This order of the Tribunal is in appeal before us.
5.  During the pendency of this appeal the respondent is stated to have died in May, 1998. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to upset the order made by the Tribunal on examination of the questions raised before us and we think the equity could be adjusted by directing that he be deemed to have continued in service till he died. However, his pension be adjusted as if he was in service till May, 1998 without being entitled to the salary or other monetary dues. Subject to above modification, the order made by the Tribunal is upheld. The question raised in this appeal need not be decided and is left open. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of .
