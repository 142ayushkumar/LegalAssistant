Collector of Customs, Madras v Kayrpee Vanijya
Supreme Court of India

3 August 1995
C.A. No. 7 of 1990
The Order of the Court was as follows:
We are not inclined to interfere in the matter.
1.  As rightly pointed out by the Tribunal the Department did not take care to take a sample and have it analysed nor has it placed any material to show that the imported goods had gone through the process of crystallisation as alleged by them. In such a situation the finding of the Tribunal arrived at in the judgment cannot be said to be faulty.
The appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
