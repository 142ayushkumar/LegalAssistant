The order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Having heard learned counsel for the appellant, we are satisfied that the appeal ought not to have been taken up and disposed of in the manner it has been done by the High Court, particularly when there was a strike.
2.  Therefore, the order of High Court is set aside dismissing the appeal and the matter is remitted to the High Court for disposal afresh in accordance with law.
Appeal allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
