Jitender Kumar Jain v State of Delhi and Others
Supreme Court of India

23 January 1995
Cr.A. No. ... of 1995 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Cr.) No. 3768 of 1994)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant had moved the High Court of Delhi in a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure invoking its inherent jurisdiction. The High Court assumed the petition to be as if one under Section 397(2) [397(3)l of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which according to it did not lie since the revision petition preferred by the appellant had been dismissed by the Court of Session.
2.   We are of the view that the High Court failed to distinguish its separate powers under Section 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as also under Section 482 of the said Code.
3.  It is true that a second revision petition does not lie before the High Court when one is dismissed by the Court of Session. Still the Court of Session is a court subordinate to the High Court and, as such, its proceedings are open to scrutiny by the High Court in exercise of its inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The High Court in these circumstances, should not have dismissed the petition of the appellant on the premise as it has done. It is otherwise open to the High Court not to interfere in a matter when examining a case under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
4.  In this view of the matter, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court and remit the matter back to the High Court for reconsideration. It is ordered accordingly.
Order accordingly.
