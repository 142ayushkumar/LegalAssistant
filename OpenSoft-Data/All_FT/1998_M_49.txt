Dy. Commercial Tax Officer and Another v M. Velmurugan
Supreme Court of India

15 September 1998
C.A. No. 7951 of 1996 with Nos. 7952 and 7953-55 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court, in the order under challenge, allowed the writ petitions filed by the respondents following its earlier judgment in C. Rathinam v. State of T. N. 1991 Indlaw MAD 113. In that judgment, the High Court had found that the assessees mixed ingredients which all stood exempted from tax from time to time by one or the other exemption notification.
2. Since the assessees merely mixed the ingredients for the facility of the consumers, the High Court held that such mixture of ingredients did not bring into existence any new commodity which could result in levy of sales tax thereon. Having regard to this finding of fact, no occasion to interfere arises.
The appeals are dismissed. No orders as to costs.
Appeals dismissed.
