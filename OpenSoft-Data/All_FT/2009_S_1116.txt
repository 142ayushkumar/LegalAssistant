The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. Petitioner No. 1- Ramesh Chandra Yadav and petitioner No. 2 Chandra Bhal were released on remission by virtue of the orders passed by the Governor of Uttar Pradesh on 26th January, 2000. Subsequently, the orders of remission passed by the Governor were set aside by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature of Allahabad. Consequently, the petitioners were taken in custody.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that petitioner No. 1 has already completed 21 years, 1 month and 20 days without remission and petitioner No. 2 has already completed 17 years, 6 months and 16 days without remission, and therefore they may now be released. It is pointed out that in similar circumstances, a number of convicts who had undergone actual sentence of 14 years were directed to be released forthwith by this Court. One of such orders was passed on 9th May, 2006 in SLP(Crl.) No. 553 of 2006.
