Messrs Glen Leven Estate Private Limited v State of Kerala and Anr
Supreme Court of India

4  May  2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17428/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Two grounds have been urged by Mr. TLV Iyer, learned senior advocate on behalf of the petitioner. One is that the notice for re-opening the proceedings by the Taluk Land Board was beyond the time.
2.  The second is that the conditions for re-opening have not been satisfied. Regarding the first ground the High Court found on merits that the notice was within time. There is no infirmity in regard to that finding. On the second aspect Mr. P. Krishnamoorthy, learned senior counsel for the State of Kerala submitted that whether conditions have been satisfied or not are matters which can be addressed before the Taluk Land Board and that will be considered at the appropriate time. We find such contentions to be forceful.
3. We are therefore not inclined to interfere with the impugned order. Accordingly, Special Leave Petition is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
