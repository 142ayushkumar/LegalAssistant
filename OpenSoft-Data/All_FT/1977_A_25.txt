Attukkaran v State of Tamil Nadu
Supreme Court of India

17 January 1977
Cr.A. No. 158 of 1975 (Cr.A. No. 262 of 1974 and Referred Trial No. 9 of 1974, D/- 18 April 1974), Dt. 17 January 1977.
The Judgment was delivered by: FAZAL ALI, J.
1.  This appeal by special leave is confined only to the question of sentence. Having regard to the facts and circumstances under which the murder was committed by the appellant, we are satisfied that this was not a case which called for the extreme penalty of death. We, therefore, allow this appeal and commute the sentence of death to that of imprisonment for life.
Appeal allowed.
