1.  This appeal by special leave is confined only to the question of sentence. Having regard to the facts and circumstances under which the murder was committed by the appellant, we are satisfied that this was not a case which called for the extreme penalty of death. We, therefore, allow this appeal and commute the sentence of death to that of imprisonment for life.
Appeal allowed.
