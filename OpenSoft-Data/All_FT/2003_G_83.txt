Gurdaspur Central Coop. Bank Ltd. v Gurdial Singh and another
Supreme Court of India

30 January 2003
C.A. No. 6144 of 2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
This Court on March 3, 2000, passed the following order:
"Delay condoned.
Issue notice confined to the question of payment of arrears of salary. Notice on prayer for interim relief also.
xx xx xx."
1.  As is evident from the order extracted above, the notice issued was confined to the question of payment of arrears of salary.
2.  Services of the respondents were terminated on August 4, 1988. Aggrieved by the same, they filed a civil suit for declaration that the order of termination of their services was illegal and also for consequential benefits. The suit was decreed, which was affirmed by the first appellate court. The second appeal filed by the appellant-Bank was also dismissed. Hence, this appeal.
3.  The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the respondents worked for only 372 and 260 days respectively. He also added that they have been working elsewhere; to pay back wages almost for a period of fifteen years without the respondents working with the appellant may not be justified. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents states that some part of the backwages could be denied.
4.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we think it just and appropriate to modify the impugned decree so far as it relates to backwages alone making the appellant to pay backwages to the extent of thirty five per cent.
5.  The appeal is disposed of in the above terms modifying the decree under challenge.
Appeal disposed of.
