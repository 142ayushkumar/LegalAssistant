D.D.A v I.J.Mongia
Supreme Court of India

16 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.16353/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
1.  After hearing the counsel for the parties, in cases like the present, where the question is with regard to the role played by the officer concerned who is being charge-sheeted in respect of the quality of the construction which is alleged to be sub-standard, we are of the opinion that merely because Delhi Development Authority, as is usual, was negligent in proceeding against the delinquent officers belatedly, can be no ground for quashing or setting aside the disciplinary action against the officer concerned.
2.  We do realise that in some cases delay in taking departmental proceedings may cause serious prejudice to the delinquent officers and in appropriate cases, the Court may interfere.
3. But in matters like this, where sub-standard houses are constructed and the material of the sub-standard houses would always be available, it would be open to the employer to take action and we do not see in such a case how the delay would in any way seriously prejudice the delinquent officer.
4.  We, accordingly, allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the High Court.
Appeal allowed.
