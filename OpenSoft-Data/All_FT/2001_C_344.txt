Commnr. of Income Tax v Messrs Krishna Talkies
Supreme Court of India

1 March 2001
C.A. No. 419 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  As learned counsel for the appellant-Revenue explains to us, the question here is not a question of interpretation of an agreement but of looking into the facts surrounding the execution of that agreement to see if it is a sham. Questions of fact, such as this question, are decided by the Tribunal, not by the Courts in reference.
The appeal is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
