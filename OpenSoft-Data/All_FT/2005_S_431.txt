Rajinder Singh v State of Haryana and others
Supreme Court of India

3 February 2005
Review Petition (C) No. 197 of 2005 in C.A. No. 2671 of 2004 with RPs (C) Nos. 198 to 211 of 2005 with C.As. Nos. 2670, 2678-79, 2682, 2684, 2683, 2685-86, 2689, 2694-95, 2697, 2699 and 2712 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
1.  We have carefully perused the grounds urged in the review petitions. We find that all the pleas are in substance a reiteration of the grounds that were urged during the hearing of the appeals and, therefore, cannot be the grounds for entertaining a review petition.
2. The petitioner cannot be permitted to seek a rehearing in the garb of a review petition. The review petitions are devoid of any merit and are dismissed.
Reviews dismissed.
