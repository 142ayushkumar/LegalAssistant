Supreme Court of India

9 January 2001
CIVIL APPEAL No. 42 of 2001 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) 15210 of 2000)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Counsel on both sides agree that in view of the decision of this court in Canara Bank & Ors. vs. National Thermal Power Corp. and Anr. the appropriate course to be followed is to direct the Company Law Board to dispose of the matter afresh. To facilitate the said course we set aside the impugned order. Now, we direct the Company Law Board to take up the matter and pass appropriate orders.
This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
