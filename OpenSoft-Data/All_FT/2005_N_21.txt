Terumo Penpol Limited and others v NCT of Delhi and another
Supreme Court of India

6 April 2005
Cr.A. No. 522 of 2005
The order of the court was as follows:
1. Special leave granted.
2. We have heard counsel for the parties.
3. In this appeal the appellant has impugned the order of the High Court whereby the application filed by the appellant for quashing of the proceeding was rejected with the observation:
"In view of the fact that the matter is pending at charge stage, I do not deem it proper to interfere at this stage."
4. Having heard counsel for the parties for some time, we are of the view that the matter requires a detailed consideration by the High Court. Counsel for the appellant submits that taking into consideration the allegations as made in the complaint, no offence u/s. 499 of the Indian Penal Code is made out and therefore, the High Court was not justified in not quashing the proceeding initiated against the appellant on the complaint of the respondent. Without expressing any opinion in the matter, we consider it desirable that the High Court should hear the parties and pronounce a reasoned order. We, therefore, remit this matter to the High Court for disposal of the application u/s. 482 CrPC in accordance with law and as indicated in this order.
5. The parties jointly request that the High Court may be requested to dispose of the matter as early as possible. We have no doubt that the High Court will consider the matter as expeditiously as possible.
6. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
Appeal disposed of.
