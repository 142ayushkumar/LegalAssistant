Ranjit Singh (Dead) By Lrs. and Others v Jaimal Singh and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 October 2000
C.A. No. 4853 of 1990
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  This is the defendant's appeal. One Mrs Gaindi was the owner of 1/8th share in an agricultural land measuring 6028 kanals and 12 marlas situated within the revenue estate of Rajaund, District Karnal. Mst Gaindi on 5-11-1964 executed a registered power of attorney in favour of Piara Singh. On 20-6-1965, Mst Gaindi entered into an agreement for sale of land measuring 68 kanals 11 marlas in favour of the plaintiff-respondents for a sum of Rs.10,000. It is alleged that the plaintiff-respondents paid the entire consideration on the same date vide receipt dated 20-6-1965 (Ext. P-3). It is also alleged by the plaintiff-respondents that Mst Gaindi died on 18-3-1966 and before her death the power-of-attorney holder on 12-3-1966 executed a sale deed in favour of the plaintiff-respondents, which was registered on 15-3-1966. It is further alleged that the plaintiff-respondents were put in possession over the said plot of land and they are in continuous possession of the said land. Subsequently, the plaintiff-respondents filed a suit for declaration of title in respect of the land covered by the agreement dated 20-6-1965 based on the sale deed dated 12-3-1966 and registered on 15-3-1966.
2. A written statement was filed by the defendant-appellants wherein they denied the date of death of Mrs Gaindi as 18-3-1966. In the written statement it was stated that Mrs Gaindi died on 12-3-1966. The trial court held that Mrs Gaindi died on 12-3-1966. Consequently, the power-of-attorney holder could not have executed the sale deed on the said date in favour of the plaintiff-respondents. In view of that finding the suit was dismissed. The first appeal filed against the said decision was also dismissed. However, in the second appeal, the High Court was of the view that even if Mrs Gaindi died on 12-3-1966, the sale deed could be executed on the said date and subsequently, registered. In view of that matter, the High Court allowed the appeal and decreed the suit of the defendant-appellants. It is against the said decision the defendants are in appeal before us.
3.  We have heard counsel for the parties and find that the case of the plaintiff-respondents before the trial court was that Mrs Gaindi died on 18-3-1966, and the power-of-attorney holder executed sale deed on 12-3-1966. It was disputed by the defendant-appellants. The defendants' case was that Mrs Gaindi died on 12-3-1966. Under such circumstances the burden of proof was on the plaintiff-respondents to establish that the power-of-attorney holder executed the sale deed when Mrs Gaindi was alive.
4. On this aspect of the matter there is no evidence on record to show that the power-of-attorney holder executed the sale deed when Mrs Gaindi was alive. In the absence of such an evidence the suit could not have been decreed. Moreover, both the courts have recorded a concurrent finding of fact that Mrs Gaindi died on 12-3-1966 and, therefore, the High Court fell in error in interfering with the said finding of fact under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
5.  Learned counsel for the plaintiff-respondents then urged that since the agreement for sale is in favour of the respondents who are in possession over the land since 20-6-1965 and they have also paid the entire consideration money, therefore, they may be granted relief of declaration as regards their possession by virtue of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. According to us, this plea is not available to the plaintiff-respondents in this proceeding. However, it may be available to them in any other proceeding when they are sought to be ejected.
For the aforesaid reasons the judgment under appeal is set aside.
6.  The appeal is allowed. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
