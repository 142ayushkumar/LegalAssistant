Commissioner of Income Tax v Shri Arbuda Mills Limited
Supreme Court of India

23 January 1996
Tax Reference Case No. 11 of 1983 (Direct reference by the Tribunal to the Supreme Court under s. 257 of the IT Act, 1961)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The Tribunal has referred under s. 257 of the IT Act, 1961, the following question of law for decision of this Court, namely:
"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the order of assessment passed by the ITO under s. 143(3) r/w s. 144B on 31st July, 1978, had merged with that of the CIT (A) dt. 15th December, 1979, in respect of the three items in dispute so as to exclude the jurisdiction of the CIT under s. 263 ?"
2.  The assessee is a company. The relevant assessment year is 1975-76 ending on 31st December, 1974. The assessment was completed under s. 143(3) r/w s. 144B, on 31st March, 1978, in which the net business loss was computed at Rs. 3,61,086 and the income under the head "Capital gains" at Rs. 38,874. The ITO had made certain additions and disallowance while computing the loss and income as above and had also accepted, inter alia, the following three claims:
(i) Deduction of a sum of Rs. 23,82,621 by way of provision for gratuity;
(ii) Depreciation on Rs. 4,21,000 which was paid by the assessee to United Textile Industries as consideration for transfer of installed property of 17,480 spindles and 400 looms of Old Manek Chowk Mills;
(iii) Loss on account of difference in exchange rate which was referable to the purchase of machinery, etc., as revenue expenditure;
3.  For the purposes of the present matter, it is only these three items of claim which are relevant.
4.  In the appeals filed by the assessee, the items in respect of which the decision was in its favour were not the subject-matter of the appeals.
5. In respect of these three items, the CIT exercised his power under s. 263 of the IT Act. The above question arises in this context.
6.  The main contention of the assessee which was considered by the Tribunal was whether or not the order of the ITO regarding the said three items in respect of which the assessee had no occasion to prefer an appeal had merged in that of the CIT (A) so as to exclude the jurisdiction of the CIT under s. 263 of the Act.
7.  We may refer to the amendment made in s. 263 of the IT Act by the Finance Act, 1989, with retrospective effect from 1st June, 1988. The relevant part thereof for the present case is as under:
"Explanation: For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that, for the purposes of this sub-section:
(c) where any order referred to in this sub-section and passed by the AO had been the subject-matter of any appeal filed on or before or after 1st June, 1988, the powers of the CIT under this sub-section shall extend and shall be deemed always to have extended to such matters as had not been considered and decided in such appeal".
8.  The consequence of the said amendment made with retrospective effect is that the powers under s. 263 of the CIT shall extend and shall be deemed always to have extended to such matters as had not been considered and decided in an appeal.
9. Accordingly, even in respect of the aforesaid three items, the powers of the CIT under s. 263 shall extend and shall be deemed always to have extended to them because the same had not been considered and decided in the appeal filed by the assessee. This is sufficient to answer the question which has been referred.
10.  The question referred is, therefore, answered in the negative, in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
Reference answered in favour of Revenue.
