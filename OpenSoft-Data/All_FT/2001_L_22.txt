The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard learned counsel for the parties. We have perused the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court, which is under appeal. Therein the Court recorded the finding that the respondent was a 'workman' as defined under Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and remanded the matter to the tribunal to adjudicate upon the validity of the order of termination of the workman.
2. The High Court has given cogent reasons in support of the findings recorded by it. We are of the view that the judgment under challenge does not call for interference. Therefore, the special leave petition is dismissed. No costs.
Petition dismissed.
