Supreme Court of India

6 November 2001
Review Petition(Civil) No.1429/2001 in S.L.P.(Civil)No.18053/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  We have perused the review petition and the order sought to be reviewed. We are not satisfied that a case for review has been made out. The Review Petition is accordingly dismissed.
2.  However, it is noticed that in the penultimate sentence of the order sought to be reviewed, some words are missing. The order should read as follows:
"Having heard learned counsel for the parties at length, we are of the view that the conclusion reached by the High Court that no final agreement fixing the rate at 0.56 paise has been arrived at between the parties, does not warrant interference. In this view of the matter, we dismiss the Special Leave Petition."
3.  Registry is directed to do the needful, regard being had to the corrected order.
Petition dismissed.
