Prakash Singh v Union of India
Supreme Court of India

18 November 1996
W.P. (C) No. 497 of 1996
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The questions raised under Article 32 of the Constitution in this writ petition by the petitioner, who is a retired Director General of Police, relate to the quality of security to be provided to certain protected persons.
One of the questions raised also relates to the kind of security, namely, the agency which should provide the security. These are matters to be decided by a committee of experts in the field depending on the threat perception for a particular protected person. These are not matters which admit of a judicial determination at this stage for deciding the nature and quality of security to be provided to any protected persons.
2.   In our opinion, these questions raised in the present case are not justiciable;
The writ petition is, therefore, misconceived. It is accordingly dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
