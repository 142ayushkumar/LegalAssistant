N. J. Albert v Commissioner of Income Tax
Supreme Court of India

24 March 1999
C.A. No. 8469 of 1995 (From the judgment and order Dt. 11 March 1987 of the Kerala High Court in IT Ref. No. 187 of 1982).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The High Court answered the questions quoted below in the negative and in favour of the Revenue in the light of its earlier decision in IT Ref. Nos. 7 and 8 of 1982, CIT vs. C. Tharian & Sons, Cashew Exporters, 1987 Indlaw KER 1411987 Indlaw KER 141
"1. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the assessee is entitled to weighted deduction under cls. (i) and (ii) of s. 35B (1)(b) of the IT Act, 1961 ?
2. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is justified in holding that 'services rendered by the agent, Nut Meat Trading Company, is not in connection with the distribution of the goods and is not the above finding wrong and unreasonable and based on conjectures and surmises ?
3. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is right in law and fact in holding that 'there are services rendered by the selling agent which come under sub-cls. (i) and (ii) of s. 35B(1)(b). It is these services which are remunerated only by the agents commission and are not the above findings wrong, unreasonable, perverse, based on surmises and baseless assertions ?
4. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the assessee is entitled to claim deduction in respect of the provision made for payment of leave with wages ?"
2.  In CIT vs. Kerala Nut Food Co. 1991 Indlaw KER 92, a Division Bench of the same High Court took note of a circular of the CBDT and certain decisions and concluded, in our view, rightly, that the decision in C. Tharian & Sons's case was per incuriam.
3.  The answer by the High Court in the instant case of the question posed to it relying exclusively upon C. Tharian & Son's case must, therefore, be held to be bad in law.
4.  We think, in the circumstances, that the reference (R.A. No. 257/Coch/81) should be restored to the file of the High Court to be heard and disposed of afresh. This shall be done expeditiously, having regard to the passage of time.
Order on the appeal accordingly. No order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
