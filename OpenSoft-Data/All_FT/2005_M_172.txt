Mangala Nursing Home v M. M. M. Enterprises
Supreme Court of India

12 August 2005
C.A. No. 5054 of 2005 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 2842 of 2003)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave granted.
1.  The trial court by its order dated 23-7-2002, rejected the prayer for making amendment in the plaint. Against the said order, when the Karnataka High Court was moved, instead of going into the correctness of the order refusing amendment, the High Court has adopted a novel procedure in finally disposing of the suit, which procedure is wholly unknown to law. The only question which the High Court should have decided is as to whether the prayer for making amendment in the plaint was justified or not.
2. Accordingly, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned order passed by the High Court, dismiss the revision application and direct that against the final judgment rendered in the suit, if an appeal is preferred by any of the parties, it would be open to the plaintiffs to challenge correctness of order passed by the trial court whereby prayer for making amendment in the plaint was rejected.
No costs.
Appeal allowed.
