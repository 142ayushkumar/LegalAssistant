Kamaljit Singh v State of Punjab and Another
Supreme Court of India

11 July 2005
Cr.A. No. 807 of 2005 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (Cri.) No. 1237 of 2005)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  Heard the counsel for the parties. In the facts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that it is an appropriate case in which the application of the appellant for grant of anticipatory bail ought to have been allowed, particularly when on similar allegations the remaining two accused have been granted the benefit of anticipatory bail.
2. In these circumstances the appeal is allowed and the appellant is directed to be released on bail in the event of arrest or surrender on his furnishing bail bonds to the satisfaction of the arresting officer or the Court, as the case may be, subject to the conditions laid down in S. 438, Cr. P.C.
Appeal allowed.
