Commissioner of Income Tax v Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Limited
Supreme Court of India

21 September 1993
C.A. Nos. 745-746 (NT) of 1976 (From the judgment of the Madras High Court, Dt. 27 September 1973 in Tax Case No. 103 of 1968 reported as CIT vs. Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Ltd. (1976) 104 ITR 337 (Mad)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are of the view that this appeal should be heard by a larger Bench. By this order we are indicating, briefly, the reasons for this view.
2.  It is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Madras High Court on a reference under s. 66(1) of the Indian IT Act, 1922, relating to the asst. yrs. 1960-61 and 1961-62. The question that the High Court was called upon to consider read thus:
"Whether the Tribunal has justification to direct the ITO to quantify the losses for the asst. yrs. 1952-53 to 1954-55 and allow the set off against the share income from the partnership firm for 1960-61 and 1961-62 ?"
3. The High Court answered the question in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee (the respondent).
4.  Very briefly, the relevant facts are that the assessee filed its returns for the asst. yrs. 1950-51 to 1955-56 on 23rd April, 1956, and claimed that it had suffered losses. The ITO issued to the assessee a notice under s. 23(2) of the Indian IT Act, 1922, fixing the matters for hearing, but, on 3rd October, 1958, he informed the assessee in writing that no cognizance could be taken of these returns as they had been filed beyond the period stipulated in that behalf.
5.  For the asst. yr. 1960-61 the assessee filed a return showing a loss after bringing forward and setting off losses of the earlier years commencing from the asst. yr. 1950-51. For the asst. yr. 1961-62 the assessee again claimed relief by way of set off in relation to losses incurred in the earlier years. The Tribunal, as the question indicates, directed the ITO to quantify the losses for the asst. yrs. 1952-53 to 1954-55 and allow to the assessee a set off against its income for the asst. yrs. 1960-61 and 1961-62. On a reference the High Court answered the question referred to it in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee.
6.  On behalf of the Revenue learned counsel submitted that the ITO had by his letter dt. 3rd October, 1958, intimated to the assessee that he was closing proceedings for the asst. yrs. 1950-51 to 1955-56 on the ground that the returns for these years had been filed beyond the period stipulated in that behalf. No steps had been taken by the assessee thereagainst, so that the losses it claimed for these assessment years could be determined. The communication of the ITO dt. 3rd October, 1958, was an order against which an appeal lay. The losses for the previous years relevant to asst. yrs. 1952-53 to 1954- 55 could only have been determined by assessment orders, and assessment orders for those years had become time-barred. The Tribunal could not, therefore, have given directions to the ITO to quantify the losses for these assessment years and allow set off against the assessee's income for the asst. yrs. 1960-61 and 1961-62.
7. Learned counsel for the Revenue relied upon the judgment of this Court in CIT vs. Manick Sons 1969 Indlaw SC 241 (SC), where it was held that the Tribunal may give directions for reopening the assessment of the year to which the appeal it was hearing related but it could not give any directions in respect of a period not covered by that year. Emphasis was laid upon the judgment of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in CIT vs. Garia Industries Pvt. Ltd. 1982 Indlaw CAL 1491982 Indlaw CAL 149 (Cal). The assessee therein filed a return disclosing a loss. No action was taken on the return and, in reply to the assessee's letter of enquiry, the ITO stated that the return was invalid. The assessee went in appeal against the order of the ITO as contained in the reply. The AAC held that the appeal was not competent.
8.  On further appeal the Tribunal held that the appeal was maintainable and the return was valid and it directed the ITO to determine the loss. On a reference, the High Court held, on an analysis of the relevant provisions, that an assessee had a substantial right to carry forward his loss to be set off against further business profits. Unless the loss had been determined and notified to the assessee he was not entitled to carry it forward. The proper effect of the ITO to the assessee was that the loss had been computed by him at 'nil'. Any other construction would lead to great hardship and an anamolous situation. The Court, therefore, held that the appeal by the assessee against the ITO's reply was maintainable. To the same effect are judgments of the Patna High Court Bihar State Electricity Board vs. CIT 1974 Indlaw PAT 19 (Pat) and the Madhya Pradesh High Court (Jaikishna Gopikishan and Sons vs. CIT 1971 Indlaw MP 32 (MP)).
9.  Learned counsel for the assessee placed great reliance upon the judgment of a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court in CIT vs. Khushal Chand Daga 1961 Indlaw SC 169 (SC). The assessee therein was a partner in a firm. In the year of account ending Diwali, 1941, he received his share of assets and property from this firm and started business on his own. In that year his sources of income were speculation, allowance from Government as treasurer, house property and dividends. The assessee had also received some profits from his share in an unregistered firm, against which were set off his loss in his individual business. The ITO who made the assessment, determined the loss to be carried forward at a certain figure.
10.  The assessee appealed against the assessment but did not question the loss which had been determined. For the asst. yr. 1942-43 the assessee claimed to reopen the question of the loss to be carried forward, contending that it was in a much higher figure. This contention was not accepted by the authorities or by the Tribunal. The contention was, however, raised again by the assessee in assessments for the asst. yrs. 1948-49 and 1949-50; the assessee contended that the profits which he had received from the unregistered firm (in the year of account ending Diwali 1941) could not be set off against his loss in his individual business as the profits of the unregistered firm had borne tax not in his hands but in those of the firm. While this contention was rejected by the authorities, it was accepted by the Tribunal and the Tribunal was then moved to refer to the High Court, inter alia, this question:
"(1) Whether, the assessee was competent in law to raise a question with regard to the determination of loss for the asst. yr. 1941-42 as finally determined in appeal, in the course of proceedings for the asst. yr. 1942-43 when the loss brought forward from 1941-42 was being set off ?"
11.  The High Court answered the question against the Revenue, which appealed to this Court by special leave. It was contended that the loss which had been determined and ordered to be carried forward (in the year of account ending Diwali, 1941) must be deemed to have become final because no appeal was filed against that determination. But this Court said:
"It appears that the procedure laid down by s. 24(3) under which the ITO has to notify to the assessee by order in writing the amount of the loss as computed by him for the purposes of that section was not followed. No doubt, under s. 30 an appeal lies, if the assessee objects to the amount of loss computed and notified under s. 24; but, inasmuch as, the ITO had not notified the loss computed by him by order in writing, an appeal could not be taken on that point. In our opinion, the assessee was, therefore, entitled to have the loss redetermined in a subsequent year."
12.  We, very respectfully, have some difficulty with regard to this judgment and are of the view that it requires reconsideration by a larger Bench. We say so for, principally, these reasons.
13. The judgment notes that the loss had been determined in the relevant year at a particular figure and that the assessee had appealed against the assessment but had not questioned the loss that had been determined. The loss has to be determined in the assessment proceedings. There was an appeal against the assessment. Necessarily, therefore, the appeal would involve the determination the loss.
14.  In any event, the loss having been determined for the relevant year in the assessment proceedings in that behalf, it is difficult to see how the assessee could be permitted to raise in the course of proceedings for assessments for subsequent years the question as to the correctness of the determination of that loss. There cannot be, at one and the same time, two different assessments of income or loss in respect of the assessment yearIt is also a little difficult to see why a formal order notified by the ITO to the assessee under s. 24(3) of the 1922 Act is imperative before an appeal is maintainable. We are of the view that the position taken in this behalf by the Calcutta, Patna and Madhya Pradesh High Courts in the judgments aforementioned is eminently reasonable and deserves consideration.
15.  Accordingly, we direct that the papers be placed before the Honourable the Chief Justice for placing the appeal, if he so deems fit, before a larger Bench.
Appeal allowed.
