State of Kerala v Abraham Mathew and Others
Supreme Court of India

15 December 1995
C.A. No. ... of 1995 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 6351 of 1993)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The only controversy with which we are concerned in this appeal is as regards the entitlement of the respondents to the additional amount under Section 23(1-A) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984. Since the award of the Collector is of 21-4-1980, the claimants are not entitled to the additional amount under Section 23(1-A) of the said Act.
2.  The appeal is accordingly allowed to the above extent. The order of the High Court is set aside. No costs.
Appeal partly allowed.
