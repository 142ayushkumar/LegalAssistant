Madhu Limaye v Metropolitan Magistrate and Others
Supreme Court of India

20 July 1984
W.P. (Criminal) No. 635 of 1984 (Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India).
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In view of the fact that the accused, who were Iranian students, have already left the country and the charges against them are of a trivial nature, the learned Additional Solicitor-General has made a statement before us that no further proceedings will be taken in pursuance of those charges. Those charges may, therefore, be taken as dropped.
2.  This petition has been filed by Shri. Madhu Limaye against an order passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate calling upon the surety to pay a sum of Rs 500 in each one of the 16 cases and, in default of payment, to suffer civil imprisonment for a period of six months. We have already stated that the charges against the accused who have already left the country are of a trivial nature.
3.   We are of the opinion that the ends of justice will be met by imposing a token penalty of Rs one hundred upon the surety in all the 16 cases together. The aforesaid amount of Rs 100 shall be paid within one month from today.
4.  The writ petition will stand disposed of in terms of this order.
Petition disposed of.
