G.R. Mehta v M.D. Dhondusa
Supreme Court of India

12 March 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.5281-5282/2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted. Heard learned counsel for the parties.
1.  The only short question raised on behalf of the appellant is that there is no sufficient service on the appellant in the facts of this case. It is not in dispute that the service which is deemed is based on publication in Kannadda daily.
2.  The submission is that the appellant does not know Kannada, though he is living there for the last 14 years. Without going into the dispute in question, we feel it appropriate on the facts and circumstsances of this case specially when the High Court has set aside the trial court judgment ex-parte to remand this case back to the High Court by setting aside ex-parte order for deciding it on merits in accordance with law.
3. Accordingly, the impugned orders of the High Court dated 17th December, 1998 and 20th August, 1998 passed in civil petition are hereby set aside. The case is remanded back to the High Court for deciding afresh in accordance with law.
4.  We make it clear that the parties shall appear before the High Court on 26th March, 2001 along with the certified copy of this order and the High Court will thereafter proceed to decide this case by giving next date to the parties. The court will fix the date and dispose it of in accordance with law.
5.  With the said observation the appeal stands disposed of. Costs on the parties.
Appeal disposed of.
