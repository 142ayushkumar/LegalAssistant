The Order of the Court was as follows:
1. We have been taken through the judgment of the High Court as also the evidence of the material witnesses. On carefully examining the material we are satisfied that this is a case of benefit of doubt and the High Court was perfectly justified in acquitting the respondents.
2. Under the circumstances, the appeals against the order of acquittal must fail. The special leave petitions moved by the brother of the deceased must also accordingly fail. The appeals are dismissed. So also the special leave petitions are dismissed.
Appeals disposed of.
