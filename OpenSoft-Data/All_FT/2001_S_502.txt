State of Andhra Pradesh v B. Prakash Rao and Others
Supreme Court of India

5 February 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal(Civil)......./2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The affidavit expected as per the order dated 9.2.2000 has not been filed in spite of repeated adjournments sought for in the matter.
2.  We feel that the State is not interested in filing such an affidavit of a responsible officer for explaining the whopping delay of 641 days.
3. It is a pity that the State takes it so easy in spite of several opportunities granted by this Court.
4.  The State administration does not want the great lapse to be corrected, and we are not inclined to give further assistance to the State in the matter.
Accordingly we dismiss the SLP on the ground of delay.
Petition dismissed.
