He will also make himself available for interrogation and trial as and when necessary. He shall not leave the area falling within the jurisdiction of the Designated Court, except with the permission of the Judge of the Designated Court. The Designated Court will be at liberty to cancel bail, if any of the conditions of bail are violated or a case of cancellation of bail is otherwise made out.
