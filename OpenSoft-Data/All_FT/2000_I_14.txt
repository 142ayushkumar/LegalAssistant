Imtilepden Ao v Vimeho Khazo and Others
Supreme Court of India

27 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17111/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Since the petitioner who has originally been appointed to the cadre on deputation has not been absorbed in the cadre inasmuch as there has been no regularisation of his temporary appointment to the post of Deputy Director, question of his claiming seniority in the cadre would not arise. The petitioner is aggrieved by the observation made by the High Court in the impugned judgment which, according to him, has not considered the subsequent temporary appointment of the petitioner in the year 1985. But, that appointment also is subject to the petitioner being regularised by the appropriate Departmental Promotion Committee and no such regularisation has been made as on date.
2. In that view of the matter, the petitioner cannot feel aggrieved by the observations made in the impugned judgment of the High Court. In the event the petitioner is regularised by the appropriate authority in accordance with law, its effect may be examined in the light of the subsequent events. It is not necessary for us to express any opinion on the same. The Special Leave Petition stands disposed of accordingly.
Petition disposed of.
