Living Media Limited v Commissioner of Income Tax and Another
Supreme Court of India

8 August 2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  We are not impressed, in the first place, by the submission that, in any event, the assessment in respect of the concerned assessment year has become time barred. Nor do we find any justification for interfering with the order of the High Court that has summarily dismissed the appellant's writ petition.
2. We have seen the order by which the Joint Commissioner of Income-tax called for a special audit. We see no reason to conclude that the order was for any reason other than the complexity of the appellant's accounts, which are referred to in some detail in the Joint Commissioner's order.
The civil appeal is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
