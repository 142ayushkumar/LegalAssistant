Baburao Kale and Others v Oriental Insurance Company Limited and Anr
Supreme Court of India

17 September 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.15452/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  In view of the fact that the order under challenge is an order of remand, we, therefore, do not find it a fit case for interference.
2.  Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners urged that in any case the petitioners are entitled to receive compensation and it is wholly immaterial whether it is paid by the Insurance Company or by the owner of the vehicle. He further urged that the petitioner-claimants have already been paid the compensation and as a result of the order of the High Court they would be required to refund the money to the Company and as such the order under challenge to the extent it directs the petitioners to refund the money be set aside. We are not inclined to entertain the argument at this stage.
3. However, it will be open to the petitioners to move an application for protection of their interest before the High Court.
With the aforesaid observation, we dismiss this special leave petition.
Petiton dismissed.
