Union of India and Others v Ranjit Thakur
Supreme Court of India

20 January 1988
Review Petition No. 43 of 1988 in C.A. No. 2630 of 1987
"The Order of the Court was as follows":
1.  This is a review petition preferred by the respondent, in this appeal.
2.  By the judgment dated October 15, 1987 (Rangit Thakur v. Union of India, 1987 Indlaw SC 284381987 Indlaw SC 284381987 Indlaw SC 28438 of this Court in appeal the proceedings of a Court-Martial, culminating in the imposition of the punishment of an year's rigorous imprisonment and dismissal from service on the appellant was quashed.
3.  The contentions urged for the appellant are noticed in and are formulated as contentions (a) (i) and (ii); (b); (c) and (d) in the said judgment.
4. The appeal was allowed and relief granted accepting the contentions at (a) (i) and (ii) and (d). Contentions (b) and (c) were not held in favour of the appellant.
5.  Contention at (a) (i) was that in the conduct of the Court-Martial there was violation of the mandatory provisions of S. 130 of the Indian Army Act, 1950.
6. In the present review petition it is pointed out - prima facie with some justification - that the Court-Martial was a 'Summary Court-Martial' and not 'Summary General Court-Martial' and that to the former, the provisions of S. 130 were not attracted.
7.  But then, even if the point taken in the review petition as to the inapplicability of S. 130 is held to be well founded, the decision, however, appears supportable on the findings on contentions at (a) (ii) and (d). But the error, if any, as so the inapplicability of S. 130 should not be left uncorrected.
8.  Issue notice confined to the finding on contention at (a) (i) in the judgment.
Order accordingly.
