Jibanananda Dey v Santilata Sahoo and Others
Supreme Court of India

2 December 2003
Petition(s) For Special Leave To Appeal (Civil) No.5315/2003
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The above appeal has been filed against the order dated 20th November, 2002 passed by the Division Bench of the Orissa High Court in A.H.O. NO. 125/2001 wherein while allowing the petition and remitting the matter certain directions also came to be issued by the High Court. Notice was ordered and the respondents have entered appearance and filed their responses.
Heard the learned counsel appearing on either side.
2.  After considering the materials on record and in the light of the submissions made by the learned counsel for either parties, we are of the view that no exception whatsoever could be taken to the order of remand passed in the matter, relegating the consideration of certain issues to the concerned and competent authorities.
3. At the same time, the infirmity of which a grievance is sought to be made is with regard to certain observations suggestive of our idea that the violations complained off are compoundable besides indicating the course to be adopted for the same.
In the light of the above, while maintaining the order of remand, we make it clear that the question as to whether any compounding is permissible or not with reference to the nature of violations to be dealt with would be a matter which is to be objectively decided by the competent authority in accordance with law and uninfluenced by any of the observations made in the judgment under challenge.
4.  We further make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion either way on such issues and that the parties on either side are at liberty to urge all their respective points available to them.
5.  The appeal shall stand finally disposed of on the above terms. No costs.
Appeal disposed of.
