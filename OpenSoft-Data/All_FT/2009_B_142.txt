1.  These transfer petitions have been filed by Aviral Bhatla (hereinafter referred to as the 'husband') seeking transfer of several cases pending before learned Chief Judge, Family Court, Gwalior, in proceedings under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (in short the Act) and Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the Code). The parties were married on 20.1.2006 at Surajkund, Haryana. It appears that there were some irreconcilable differences between the parties and despite concerted and serious efforts the parties were not able to resolve their disputes and were living separately since 10.10.2007. It appears that after the transfer petitions were filed before this Court, learned counsel for the parties made efforts to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the disputes relating to the matrimonial discord. The Mediation Centre of the Delhi High Court also played a vital role in arriving at a settlement. The details of the litigations between the parties are as follows:
"(i) The petitioner has filed a case/petition under Section 13 (1)(ia) read with Section (iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 titled Aviral Bhatla v. Bhawna Bhatla 2009 Indlaw SC 201 bearing case No.48/07 which is pending in the court of Mr. Ashok Bhardwaj, ASG Gurgaon, Haryana.
