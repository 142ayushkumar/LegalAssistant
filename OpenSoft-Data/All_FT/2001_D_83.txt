Naresh Chandra Singhania v Deepika Baby
Supreme Court of India

4 December 2001
I.A. Nos. 5-6 In C.A. No.5549-5550/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  On 11th May, 2001, we permitted the respondent-wife to pick her children from the residence of her husband at Ghaziabad and keep them at her residence for 24 hours twice in a month. It appears that the said arrangement did not materialise. Under such circumstances the respondent-wife filed an application for direction for custody of her children from her husband. On that application we directed for production of children in Chambers at 1.30 p.m. today.
2.  In compliance with the said order, petitioner-husband has produced both the children. We then talked to the children alone as well as in the presence of mother (respondent-wife) and her counsel and tried to ascertain their wish as to whether they would like to go to their mother, but the children are not inclined to go to their mother. Even the respondent asked her children to visit her house, but they declined.
3.  Under such circumstances, counsel for the parties suggested that this matter be postponed for six months.List after six months.
Order accordingly.
