Sarjiwan v Shiv Kumar and Anr
Supreme Court of India

3 November 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.5471/2000
The Order of the court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The order under challenge allowed the appeal principally on the ground that the respondents had not been appearing. There is next to no discussion on the merits. We have seen the reasons advanced by the appellant, who was the second respondent before the High Court, for his non-appearance. We are of the view that, in those circumstances, the order under appeal should be set aside and the appeal (S.A.O. No.85 of 1983) restored to the High Court to be heard and disposed of on merits.
2. Having regard to the passage of time, this shall be done expeditiously. The civil appeal is allowed accordingly. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
