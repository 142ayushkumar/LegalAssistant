2.  We accordingly direct that the petitioners shall not be dispossessed from the premises till 30th June, 2001 subject to filing a usual undertaking to this effect in this Court by 10th January, 2001.
3. In case the respondents are aggrieved against this part of the order, it will be open to them to move this Court for recall of this part of the order.
Petition dismissed.
