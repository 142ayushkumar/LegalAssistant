Avtar Singh v Union of India and Anr
Supreme Court of India

11 December 2000
The order of the court was as follows:
Delay condoned. Substitution allowed.
1.  We are not inclined to interfere in these petitions. We also wish to clarify that the order in Smt. Bachan Kaur's case (I.A. Nos. 2, 3 and 4 in Writ Petition (C) No. 521 of 1994) was given on its own facts and it was clearly mentioned in that order that the said case is not to be treated as a precedent. Reliance on that order, in support of these petitions is, therefore, not well founded.
2. Learned counsel for the petitioners as well as S. Balwant Singh, appearing in person in WP(C) (D.No. 11929/2000), however, submit that the petitioners would like to make a representation to the State Government under the Swatantra Sainik Samman Pension Scheme, 1980, as formulated by the Government of India for grant of pension to the freedom fighters and in case the State Government finds merit in their representations, it should forward the same to the Central Government for passing appropriate orders within a reasonable time.
3.  While dismissing these petitions, we reserve liberty to the petitioners as prayed for by them. In the event, any such representations are received by the State Government, the same shall be considered by the State Government on their own merits and if satisfied, the State Government may forward the same to the Central Government for appropriate action within two months of the receipt of the representations. The Central Government shall also pass orders within two months from the receipt of the opinion of the State Government.
Except for what we have said above, these writ petitions fail and are dismissed.
Petitions dismissed.
