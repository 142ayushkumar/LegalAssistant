Government of T.N. and Another v G. Mohamed Ameenuddin and Others
Supreme Court of India

11 March 1999
Civil Appeal No. 810 of 1998
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. We have heard learned counsel on both sides for quite some time. Considering the nature of the matter, we think it would be appropriate for the appellant to frame a scheme to absorb the respondents and other employees who have been retrenched who are similarly placed. Once in a decade, census operation is carried out and those persons who have registered themselves in the Employment Exchange get jobs in the Census Department and when the project is over, their employments come to an end, they are retrenched thereby losing both the employment and their position in the queue in the Employment Exchange.
In these circumstances, it would be appropriate for the appellant to work to a scheme to absorb these employees in appropriate employments. Let such a scheme be worked out as we think that such a situation occasionally arises. On earlier occasions when such situations had arisen, those who had done similar jobs, had been absorbed in Government service by the appellant. In doing so, the Government may also bear in mind whether the employees can be recruited in the local authorities, quasi governmental organisations or Government Companies.
2. Let this matter be called after eight weeks.
Order accordingly
