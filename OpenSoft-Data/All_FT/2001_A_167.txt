Amrit Singh and Anr v State of Himachal Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

4 April 2001
The order of the court was as follows:
1.  Learned counsel for the State of Himachal Pradesh invited our attention to the operative portion of the sessions court's judgment for showing that the trial court actually awarded rigorous imprisonment for five years under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code 
besides a fine of Rs.1000/- each.
2.  The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that what is read out from the session court's judgment can be a mistake either typographical or otherwise because the High Court had noted that as rigorous imprisonment for two years.
Learned counsel for the petitioners offered to produce necessary documents to convince that the error has crept in the judgment of the session court and not in the High Court.
List after two weeks.
Order accordingly.
