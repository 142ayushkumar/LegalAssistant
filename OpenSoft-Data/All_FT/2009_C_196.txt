Sargam Cinema v Commissioner of Income-tax
Supreme Court of India

19 October 2009
C.A. No. 6973 of 2009
The order of the court was as follows:
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.
By consent, the matter is taken up for final hearing.
1.  In the present case, we find that the Tribunal decided the matter rightly in favour of the assessee inasmuch as the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the assessing authority could not have referred the matter to the Departmental Valuation Officer (DVO) without the books of account being rejected.
2. In the present case, a categorical finding is recorded by the Tribunal that the books were never rejected. This aspect has not been considered by the High Court. In the circumstances, reliance placed on the report of the DVO was misconceived.
For the above reasons, the impugned judgment of the High Court is set aside and the order passed by the Tribunal stands restored to the file. Accordingly, the assessee succeeds.
Civil appeal is allowed. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
