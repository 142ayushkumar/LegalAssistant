2. However, the learned Single Judge while deciding the writ petition shall not be influenced by any finding recorded by the Division Bench in Writ Appeal No.1109/2001.
3.  We further direct that promotion, if any, made shall be subject to the decision in the writ petition. The learned Single Judge shall dispose of the petition expeditiously.
With these observations, both the special leave petitions are dismissed.
