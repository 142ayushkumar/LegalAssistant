Notified Area Committee v Additional Director, Consolidation and Others
Supreme Court of India

4  May  2001
C.A. No. 3605 of 2001 (Arising Out of S.L.P. (C) No. 6354 of 2001)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The writ petition has been disposed of by the High Court without stating any reason whatsoever. Time and again this Court has pointed out that reasons are the flesh and blood of judicial adjudication and such reasons must be shown in the orders which are liable to be challenged in the superior court. That applies to the High Court also.
The impugned order reads thus:
"We have heard the learned counsel on merits. We find no merit in this petition. Dismissed."
2.  It is not a reasoned order. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order and remand the matter back to the High Court for disposal of the writ petition afresh in accordance with law.
This appeal is disposed of accordingly.
Appeal disposed of.
