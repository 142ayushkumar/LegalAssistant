Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation v U. A. Malek
Supreme Court of India

22 November 2000
C.A. No. 1408/1993, Dt. 22 November 2000.
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  The respondent who is employed in the establishment of the appellants was charged with misappropriation of the money of the Corporation by not issuing tickets to the passengers on certain dates.
2.  Thereafter, an enquiry was held and he was dismissed from service. The respondent raised a dispute under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the Labour Court allowed the reference partially directing the appellant to provide employment to the respondent afresh making it clear that he will not be entitled to any back wages.
3. On the matter being carried by way of a writ petition to the High Court against the said award, the same having been dismissed, this appeal is filed.
4.  It is now brought to our notice that the respondent has been in service in the establishment of the appellant from the year 1982 onwards pursuant to the award of the Labour Court. In the circumstances, we do not think it would be appropriate to upset the present state of affairs when the respondent has been in employment for such a long period.
Appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
