Randhir Singh and Others v Board of School Education, Haryana and Another
Supreme Court of India

18 January 1988
C.A. No. 265 of 1988 (Arising out of S.L.P. (C) No. 7269 of 1986)
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Special leave granted.
Heard learned counsel for the parties
1.  In our opinion, it is a fit case where the Board should have regularised the services of the appellants as they were employed as casual workers, although admittedly they were clerks in the office of the Board. It is therefore directed that their services will be regularised from the date they joined initially in the service of the Board. However, it is made clear that they will not get monetary benefit for the period they were not in service, but they will gain other advantages of continuous service during this period
2.  The appeal is disposed of accordingly. There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal disposed of.
