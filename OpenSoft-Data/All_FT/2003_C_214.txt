Flex Laminators and Flex Industries Limited v Commissioner of Central Excise, Meerut
Supreme Court of India

17 December 2003
C.A. Nos. 5291-5293 of 1997
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals arise out of an order passed by the Customs, Excise and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, New Delhi (for short "the Tribunal").
2.  One of the questions which arises in these appeals relates to the validity of Section 11A of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (for short "the Act"). The said question stands concluded by a decision of this Court in ITW Signode India Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise, 2003 Indlaw SC 1080.
3.  The other question which arises in these appeals is as to whether the alleged suppression made by the appellant was bona fide or not. It is urged on behalf of the appellant that in fact there was no suppression and the non-disclosure was a bona fide one. The learned Counsel contends that the Tribunal has committed certain factual errors and has not considered the then existing trade practice as well as the fluid legal position then existing.
4.  Having heard the learned Counsel for the parties, we are of the view that if the appellant is aggrieved against that part of the order, it is open to him to move the Tribunal under Section 35C of the Act. In case such an application is filed by the appellant herein, the same may be entertained and decided on merits by the Tribunal.
5.  With these directions, these appeals stand disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
Appeals disposed of.
