Cement Corporation of India Limited v Purya and others
Supreme Court of India

31 July 2001
C.A. No. 6986 of 1999 With C.A. No. 6987 of 1999
The Order of the Court was as follows :
1. The appeals come to be heard by this Bench pursuant to the order of a Bench of two learned Judge passed on 29th November, 1999. The order states that the appeal is to be placed before a Bench of three learned Judges because the observations in paragraph (8) of the decision of a three-Judge Bench in Special Deputy Collector & Anr. vs. Kurra Sambasiva Rao & Ors. (1997 (6) S.C.C. 41 1997 Indlaw SC 2969), regarding the interpretation of Section 51-A of the Land Acquisition Act, are sought to be re-considered. We have read the afore-mentioned observations. We have also read the judgment of another Bench of three learned Judges in Land Acquisition Officer and Mandal Revenue Officer vs. V.Narasaiah (2001 (3) S.C.C. 530 2001 Indlaw SC 20254), which appears to place upon Section 51-A a construction very different from that placed in the observations in Kurra Sambasiva Rao. We are, therefore, of the view that these appeals now require to be heard by a Constitution Bench.
2. The papers shall be placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate directions.
Order accordingly
