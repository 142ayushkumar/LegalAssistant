Mahavir Singh v State of Haryana and Others
Supreme Court of India

24 August 2001
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.20063/2000
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The appellant Mahavir Singh was promoted to the post of a Driver from the post of a Peon in the year 1995.
2.  Thereafter, certain rules were framed in the year 1996 which provided for qualification for the post of Driver stating that the candidate must have passed at least middle school examination with Hindi. On the basis that the appellant does not possess qualification of middle school examination he was reverted to his original post. He unsuccessfully filed Writ petition before the High Court.
3.  Fact remains that when he was appointed in 1995 there was no such rule in force requiring passing of middle school examination. Hence the question of examining whether he possesses the said qualification under the rule, which came into force subsequently will not be of any avail to the respondents. This aspect was lost sight of by the High Court.
4. In that view of the matter we allow this appeal and set aside the order made by the High Court and hold that the promotion of the appellant to the post of Driver is in order. The appeal is allowed accordingly by setting aside the order of the High Court and quashing the order of reversion to the post of Peon. No order as to costs.
Appeal allowed.
