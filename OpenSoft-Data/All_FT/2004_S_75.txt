Sant Kumar Mishra v State of Madhya Pradesh
Supreme Court of India

14 July 2004
S.L.P.(Cr.)No. 2571 of 2004
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Heard learned counsel for the petitioner.
1.  The only case canvassed in support of this special leave petition is that Anil Mishra, husband of the deceased and his brothers namely, Ravi Prakash @ Guddu, Satya Prakash Mishra and Indra Prakash @ Prakash Mishra have been granted anticipatory bail by different learned judges of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh. The orders granting anticipatory bail to the said accused excepting the husband have been enclosed as annexures 3, 4 and 5 respectively. From the orders granting anticipatory bail, it does not appear on what consideration bail was granted by the High Court. Prima facie, we are of the view that the High Court was not at all justified in granting anticipatory bail to aforesaid three persons.
In our view, this is a fit case in which this Court should suo motu, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution should issue notices to the aforesaid persons as to why orders granting anticipatory bail to them be not set aside.
2.  In view of these facts, the prayer for anticipatory bail made on behalf of the petitioner is, therefore, rejected and the special leave petition is accordingly dismissed.
Issue notice to the aforesaid persons to show cause as to why orders granting anticipatory bail to them by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh be not set aside.
Petition dismissed.
