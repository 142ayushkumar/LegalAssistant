Mahila Kamlesh v Nayrayan Dass
Supreme Court of India

11 December 2000
Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.17101/1999
The Order of the Court was as follows:
Leave granted.
1.  The landlady is the appellant against the revisional order of the High Court intefering with the order of eviction passed by the Controller. The High Court exercised its power of revision under section 23-E of the M.P.Accommodation of Control Act. Under the said Act, the landlady filed an application under section 23-A(b) claiming bonafide need of the premises. The tenant never filed any written statement.
2.  The Controller on consideration of materials came to the conclusion that the bonafide need is established and accordingly passed an order of eviction. The High Court in revision on re appreciation of the evidence inteferred with the said findings of the Controller. The High Court has failed to notice the provisions of section 23- D(3) whereunder statutory presumption is there about existence of bonafide need.
3. The landlady has filed an application indicating the requirement with reference to Clauses (a) and (b) and it will be for the tenant to rebut the said presumption. Under section 23-J, the landlady being a widow - 2 would be a landlady under Chapter-III-A.
In the aforesaid premises, we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in inteferring with the finding of bonafide requirement recorded by the Controller.
4.  We accordingly set aside the impugned order of the High Court and affirm the order of eviction passed by the Controller. This appeal is allowed.
Appeal allowed.
