Kashinath Singh v Nanded Municipal Corporation, Nanded and Others
Supreme Court of India

25 November 2003
C.A. Nos.4484-4485 Of 2002
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  These appeals arise out of the Judgment and Order passed by Bombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench at Aurangabad. The dispute relates to admissibility of the revised scale of pay as claimed by the appellant who has initially been the employee of the Nanded Municipal Council which was later on converted into a Municipal Corporation.
2.  The appellant has been working as Assistant Octroi Superintendent initially and in the year 1977 he was placed in the pay-scale of Rs.275-15-440-20-500. Other categories of employees, namely, Office Superintendent, Shop and Establishment Inspector, Auditor, Junior Assistant Octroi Superintendent and Head Clerk were working in different pay-scales but all seem to be in the lower pay-scale. They were all put in one category of pay-scale, namely, Rs.275-15-415-20-500. Thereafter, all the six categories of employees were placed in the scale of pay of Rs.500-900/-.
3.  In the year 1982, four categories of above said posts except Assistant Octroi Superintendent and Junior Octroi Superintendent, were upgraded and placed in the pay-scale of Rs.600-1150/-. The appellant also demanded the same scale of pay claiming parity in the sense that since all of them were earlier in the same pay-scale, when it was revised to Rs.600-1150/-.
4. The respondents, however, indicated that the other four posts, namely, Office Superintendent, Shop and Establishment Inspector, Auditor and Head Clerk were upgraded in 1982. As a consequence of upgradation of those posts their scale of pay was fixed/revised to Rs.600-1150/-. Hence, the appellant cannot make a grievance that his scale of pay was not revised.
5.  Learned counsel for the appellant submits that initially the appellant's scale of pay was higher as compared to others but all of them were placed in the same revised pay-scale and at a later stage also higher scale of pay was made admissible to all the six categories of posts, hence, the appellant stood discriminated against.
In our view, the reason which has been indicated for giving the higher pay-scale to other four categories of employees is reasonable and justified. It is for the administration to consider as to which of the posts need to be upgraded keeping in view the nature of their duties and responsibilities.
6.  Upgradation of posts, it is submitted by the learned counsel for the respondents, was not challenged. We also find it mentioned in the Judgment of the High Court that before his retirement the appellant was placed in the pay-scale of Rs.1640-1920. The appellant, it is informed, has already retired in the year 1996. Considering all the facts and circumstances and the fact that the posts of those who have been placed in the pay-scale of Rs.600-1150/- were upgraded, we do not find any merit in these appeals nor do we find any infirmity in the order passed by the High Court.
In the result, the appeals are dismissed. No costs.
Appeals dismissed.
