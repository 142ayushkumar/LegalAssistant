Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No.4206/2001
The Order of the Court was as follows:
1.  Heard the petitioner in person. The so called dispute, which the petitioner seeks for a reference to the Industrial Tribunal having been agitated before the Central Administrative Tribunal earlier, and the same having been dismissed on merits, and Special Leave Petition against the same having been dismissed by this Court, it is no longer open for the competent authority to make a reference as the dispute cannot be held to be still subsists.
2. In that view of the matter, we see no justification for our interference.
The SLP is dismissed.
Petition dismissed.
