Uttar Pradesh Indian Medical Institutions (Acquisition and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1982_Section Preamble--> State(s): Uttar Pradesh An Act to provide for the acquisition and management of certain non-government institutions imparting instruction in Ayurvedic and Unani-Tibbi Systems of medicine, to provincialize education in such systems of medicine, to regulate the imparting of instruction in naturopathy and Yoga Therapy and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
