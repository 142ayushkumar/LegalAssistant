United Provinces First Offender's Probation Act, 1938_Section Preamble--> State(s): Uttar Pradesh 1 An Act to provide for the release on probation of first offenders Whereas it is expedient to amend and consolidate the law relating to release on probation of first offenders in certain cases and to provide for other matters incidental thereto; It is hereby enacted as follows :- Statement of Object In Section 562 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,(Now see Section 482, Cr. P.C., 1973) there was a provision empowering Courts to release certain first offenders on probation of good conduct instead of passing a sentence on them. This provision was considerably restricted in its scope and it applied only to certain minor offences. In 1923 this section was amended and its scope was considerably widened. It now applies to every person of whatever sex or age convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for not more than seven years and to all women and all men under 21 years of age convicted of an offence not punishable with death or transportation for life. The Court is empowered to release such persons if they are first offenders on their entering into bonds, with or without sureties, to keep peace and be of good behaviour. Provision was also made for the first time in 1923 empowering Courts to release certain first offenders in trivial cases after admonition. The State Government is of opinion that in order to ensure that an offender released on probation of good conduct really conducts himself properly and becomes a useful member of the society something more definite is required than the mere taking of security, and that a provision for placing such offenders under the supervision of certain officers or societies appointed to take care of them and watch their behaviour and conduct would achieve that object. This Bill is, therefore, introduced for the purpose. It is intended to replace Sections 562, 563 and 564 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The important changes introduced in these sections are the following : (1) Under Section 552 (1) of the Code before releasing an offender on probation the court is to take into account the age, character and antecedent only. It is now proposed that such order is also made on consideration of his physical and mental condition. (2) Under Section 564 of the Code it is required that the offender or at least one of his sureties should reside and carry on a regular occupation within the jurisdiction of the Court or at any place where the offender is likely to live. In order to give the sureties a real and effective control over the offender, this Bill provides in the proviso to clause 4 (1) that both the offender as well as at least one of his sureties should so reside or carry on occupation. (3) More elaborate provisions for taking action on the offender's failure to observe the condition of his release are provided in this Bill and power has been given to the Court instead of sentencing the offender for the original offence to impose on him penalty not exceeding Rs. 50 and to let him continue on probation. (4) New provision has been made in clause (2) to enable the court to place offenders under 24 years of age under the supervision of a probation officer. Additional conditions, e.g. with respect to residence or abstention from intoxicants, may be imposed on the passing of a supervision order and security for their observance may be taken. Provision has also been made to vary the condition of release and the term of the security bond on the application of the probation officer. As Government will have to consider the question of appointment of probation officers or recognition of certain societies to be invested with the powers to nominate probation officers before the new Act can function, it is provided in the Bill that the Act shall come into force on such date as the State Government may notify. In 1938, came the present Act which replaced Sections 562, 563 and 564 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,1 and brought important changes in the law relating to first offenders. The Probation of Offenders Act (No. XX of 1958) has since been enacted by the Parliament, but has not been applied to the State of Uttar Pradesh as yet. Received the assent of the Governor General on 22nd November, 1938, and was published under Section 76 of the Government of India Act, 1935, on 3rd December, 1938.
