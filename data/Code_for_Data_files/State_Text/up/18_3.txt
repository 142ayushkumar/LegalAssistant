Sales Tax Act, 1948, are necessary to implement the various decisions taken on the recommendations of the U.P. Sales Tax Simplification Committee. 2. The salient features of such amendments are as follows : (a) Dealers are being enabled to claim deduction in respect of goods returned within six months of the date of sale. Provision is also being made for refund of fee of registration or renewal where the business is discontinued. (b) The amount of penalty for failure to apply for registration or renewal is being reduced in certain cases; the fee for application under section 35 for determination of the question regarding the rate or point of tax on any commodity is being abolished. (c) Time-limit for disposal of remanded cases and cases reopened under section 21, is being reduced. (d) Provision is being made for reopening of the provisional assessment orders made ex parte in certain cases. (e) The rate of interest on refundable amount is being increased from 12 per cent to 18 per cent per annum. (f) For expediting the recovery of arrears it has been considered necessary to provide for collection of the dues through departmental officers also and to empower the Commissioner, Sales Tax, to permit the deposit of dues in monthly instalments. (g) Provision is being made to avoid levy of double tax on ginned cotton, dressed hides and skins or tanned leather or rice manufactured respectively from raw cotton, raw hides and skins or paddy. (h) To remove the hardships of the dealers, who, due to genuine difficulties, could not file appeal against the assessment orders, and to avoid revenue loss, the Commissioner is being given powers to revise assessments in certain cases. (i) In order to eliminate the possibility of conflicting judgments by various revising and additional revising authorities on the same point of law and to have a better assessment of the facts of the case, provision is being made for constitution of a Sales Tax Tribunal, to hear appeals against the order of appellate authority in place of the provision for revision by revising and additional revising authorities. (j) Opportunity has also been taken to make certain other amendments for removing ambiguities and for validating certain acts. 3.To remove the doubts regarding the validity of the provision regarding fee under the U.P. Sales Tax Act for revision to the High Court, the provision from the former is being omitted and inserted in the Court Fees Act, 1870, by amending Schedule II thereof. 4.As the matter was urgent and the State Legislature was not in session, the Governor promulgated the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1978 (See 1979 43 S.T.C. Statutes 12.), on November 13, 1978. The Bill is accordingly introduced to replace the said Ordinance."
