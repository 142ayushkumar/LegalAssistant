The widening gap between the rising urban population and the housing stock added every year has gradually reached such a critical stage that the problem of providing proper shelter and desirable standard of living seems very difficult to be solved. Moreover, majority of the citizen of urban areas of the State cannot think in terms of owning (Corrected by Noti. No. 524/79-Vi-1-10-(Ka) 12-2010, dated 18-5-2010) houses on individual basis because of the shortage of land in the urban areas. The efforts made by the Government as well as different agencies have not made much dent into the housing problem. Uttar Pradesh is predominantly an agricultural State; it is not advisable to use fertile lands more and more for housing purposes which ultimately will affect the production of food grains. It is essential that for solving housing problem economy in the use of land as well as in the use of capital investment should be observed, for which Group Housing development will have to be promoted. With a view to promoting the Group Housing, it has been decided to make a law to provide for the ownership of an individual apartment in a building of an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appurtenant of such apartment and to make such apartment and interest heritable and transferable. The Uttar Pradesh Apartment (Promotion of Construction, Ownership and Maintenance) Bill, 2010 is introduced accordingly.
