Uttar Pradesh Civil Laws (Reforms and Amendment) Act, 1976_Section Preamble--> State(s): Uttar Pradesh 1 An Act further to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the Arbitration Act, 1940, the Indian Contract Act, 1972, the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, 1887, the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, 1887 , the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the Registration Act, 1908, and the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, in their application to the State of Uttar Pradesh. It is hereby enacted in the Twenty-seventh Year of Republic of India as follows :- Statement of Object Statement of Objects and Reasons for introducing Amendment of Transfer of Property the Bill:- (1) Undue delay in disposal of civil cases and the growing tendency to abuse the process of court by frivolous litigation are detrimental to the interest of the society in general and the poorer sections in particular. It is proposed to amend various provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to achieve speedy disposal of civil cases and prevention of dilatory tactics. 2. Certain provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1940 are being amended with a view to making the remedy of arbitration more efficacious and popular. 3. It is considered desirable that when a proposal is made in response to an invitation which reserves a period for deliberation, the proposal so made shall not be revocable during that period. Again, where performance of a contract is accepted by a party beyond the stipulated time, it is desirable that the right of such acceptor to claim compensation for the loss occasioned due to such delay should not be forfeited unless waived specifically. Amendments in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 are proposed accordingly. 4. It is proposed to raise the pecuniary jurisdiction of Munsifs and Judges of the Small Cause Courts by suitable amendments in the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, 1887 and the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, 1887. 5. A deed of adoption of a child, a sale-deed of immovable property of the value below Rs. 100 and an agreement to sell immovable-property, are not required compulsorily to be registered at present. Playing upon the element of chance involved in oral evidence, fictitious ante-dated deeds of such nature are set up with a view to usurp the property of a rightful transferee of legatee, and on the other hand genuine transactions of these categories are challenged. Suitable amendments are proposed in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the Registration Act, 1908 and the Hindu Adoptation and Maintenance Act, 1956 to make compulsory the registration of the adoption deeds, all agreements to sell immovable property and all transfers of immovable property irrespective of the value or consideration. The Bill is accordingly introduced. (See U.P. Gazette, Extra., dated 5 the November, 1976). Received the assent of the President of India on December 30, 1976 and published in U.P. Gazette, Extra., dated December 31, 1976.
