Uttar Pradesh Civil Laws (Amendment) Act, 1973_Section Preamble--> State(s): Uttar Pradesh An Act further to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, 1887 in their application to Uttar Pradesh, and the Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 In exercise of the powers conferred by section 3 of the Uttar Pradesh State Legislature (Delegation of Powers) Act, 1973, the President is pleased to enact as follows:- Statement of Object The Uttar Pradesh Civil Laws (Amendment) Act, 1972, which came into force on September 20, 1972, amended inter alia section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, so as to provide that in eases of suits valued below Rs. 20,000, the District Courts, alone (and not the High Court) shall be competent to entertain the revisions. A Full Bench has been constituted by the High Court to consider the question whether the aforesaid amended section 115 would apply also in respect of cases instituted in the trial courts before September 20, 1972. The amendment proposed in clause 2 of the Bill is intended to clarify the legal position in this regard. 2. Similarly, the amendment proposed in clause 5 of the Bill is intended to prevent the abuse of the exempting provision contained in clause (c) of section 2 (1) of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Building (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 which excludes any building used or intended to be used as a factory from the operation of the said Act. It has been represented that landlords have claimed unintended benefit by invoking the exemption provision in cases where any plant is installed by a tenant in a building leased out by the landlord. It, is therefore, proposed that the exemption under clause (c) of section 2 (1) of the Act should be applicable only where the building is leased by the landlord along with the plant installed therein and not otherwise. Clause (c) of section 2(1) after it is amended in the manner proposed would be in conformity with the existing provision in clause (d) of the said section 2(1). 3. Opportunity is also being taken to carry out some other amendments of consequential or clarificatory nature in Order L of the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and section 25 of the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, 1887 in their application to the State of Uttar Pradesh and sections 8 and 43 of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972. 4. The Committee constituted under the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Uttar Pradesh State Legislature (Delegation of Powers) Act, 1973 (33 of 1973) has been consulted before the enactment of this measure as a President's Act.
