Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Taxes and Other Public Moneys (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1970_Section 6--> State(s): Uttar Pradesh The Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Taxes and Other Public Moneys (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1970 is hereby repealed. The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Taxes and Other Public Moneys (Amendment and Validation) Bill, 1970 (Uttar Pradesh Gazette, Extraordinary, dated 3rd March, 1970, page 43.), runs as follows :- "The High Court, in Writ Petition No. 334 of 1968, decided on August 18, 1969, held section 3 of the Public Moneys (Recovery of Dues) Act, 1965 as violating the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution, on the ground that the State has an arbitrary discretion to proceed against any defaulter either under the civil court or by way of revenue recovery proceedings, which are of a summary nature. In view of this decision it was apprehended that provision of the other Uttar Pradesh enactments enabling recovery of any tax, cess, fee, duty or any other impost or other dues as arrears of land revenue might also be declared unconstitutional on the said ground. This position was unsatisfactory from the point of view of recovery of taxes and various other public dues. It was accordingly decided to have only the summary procedure in all such cases and to give up the alternative remedy of suit in civil courts, and thereby to remove the ground of the above decision for holding the special provisions for recovery to be ultra vires. Accordingly, the Governor, promulgated the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Taxes and Other Public Moneys (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, 1970, on January 6, 1970. This Bill is being introduced to replace the said Ordinance."
