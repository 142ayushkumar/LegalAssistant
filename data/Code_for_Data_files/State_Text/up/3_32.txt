Code of Civil Procedure (United Provinces Amendment) Act, 1948_Section Preamble--> State(s): Uttar Pradesh 1 An Act to Amend the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, in its application to the Uttar Pradesh Whereas doubts have arisen about the true meaning of Cl. (c) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 60 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908; And whereas it is necessary to remove those doubts : It is hereby enacted as follows : Extract from the statement of objects and Reasons "Section 60, Civil Procedure Code provides for exemption of houses and other buildings as also of other moveable properties belonging to agriculturists and occupied by them. But divergent views have been held by courts with regard to its application to exemption of a house mortgaged by an agriculturist from the sale under the mortgaged decree. An amendment to this effect has, therefore, been found necessary. It is intended to make it clear that the houses of agriculturists even though they have been mortgaged by them will be exempt from sale in the same manner as houses not so mortgaged even in the case of decrees based on mortgage or charge. It shall apply to any sale that is to take place after the Act comes into force irrespective of whether the decree was passed prior to or after the Act came into force. The Bill seeks to introduce an amendment in the Civil Procedure Code to give relief in this respect to those agriculturist also whose houses are mortgaged."2 Received the assent of the Governor General on August 11, 1948, under Section 76 of the Government of India Act, 1935, as adapted by the India (Provisional Constitution) Order, 1947, and was published,3 in the United Provinces Government Gazette, dated August 28, 1948.
