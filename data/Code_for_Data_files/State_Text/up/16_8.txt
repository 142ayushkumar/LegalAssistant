Uttar Pradesh Participatory Irrigation Management Act, 2009_Section Preamble--> State(s): Uttar Pradesh 1 An Act to provide for empowering the water users' association to play their role as effective instruments of Participatory Irrigation Management and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Whereas the State Government has in its State Water Policy declared in 1999 resolved to adopt integrated water resources management through participatory approach; And, whereas, water users' associations have to be given an effective role in equitable distribution of water and its efficient and optimum use, operation and maintenance of irrigation and drainage systems, promotion of conjunctive use of surface and ground water, command area development, assessment and recovery of water charges and protection of environment and ecology. It is hereby enacted in the Sixtieth Year of the Republic of India as follows :- Statement of Object In Uttar Pradesh Canal System of 74,000 K.M. length and 29,000 tube well are under the administrative control of the Irrigation Department of the Stale Government. The gross command area of Uttar Pradesh is 2.579 crore hectare of which irrigation facility is available to 66 percent. Of the total 1.697 crore hectare of irrigated area 26.3 percent is irrigated by canals. In spite of the said irrigation facilities the agricultural productivity of command area was inadequate as compared to other Slates of the Country. The canal irrigation could not work with its full skill the reason of which was inadequate maintenance including short realization of revenue and increasing expenditure on management and the total management by the State Government. The other aspects to be worried were large number of agricultural holdings in the command area due to which the farmers were not economically capable themselves to adopt modem means. As a result thereof the distribution of irrigation water, maintenance of record of irrigated area, recovery of revenue and management etc. had become very difficult for the government institutions. It was felt that the productivity of agricultural holdings of command area may continue to decrease unless the farmer of the command area form their associations and adopt modern agricultural process, irrigation and input management. Therefore, for the proportional and desired utilization of canal water, and long term stability of irrigated agriculture with the co-operation of the community, it was necessary to secure community co-operation by forming water users' associations. It was, therefore, decided to make a law to provide for constitution of the water users' association and empowering them to play their role as effective instruments of participatory irrigation management. Since the State Legislature was not in session and immediate legislative action was necessary to implement the aforesaid decision, the Uttar Pradesh Participatory Irrigation Management Ordinance, 2008 (U.P. Ordinance No. 8 of 2008) was promulgated by the Governor on December 26, 2008. This Bill is introduced to replace the aforesaid Ordinance. Received the assent of the Governor on 19th February, 2009 vide Notification No. 341(2)/LXXIX- V-l-09-1 (Ka)-35-2008, dated 20th February, 2009 and published in the U. P.
