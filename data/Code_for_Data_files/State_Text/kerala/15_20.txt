Kerala Professional Colleges or Institutions (Prohibition of Capitation Fee, Regulation of Admission, Fixation of Non-Exploitative Fee and Other Measures to Ensure Equity and Excellence in Professional Education) Act, 2006_Section Preamble--> State(s): Kerala An Act to provide for prohibition of capitation fee, regulation of admission, fixation of non-exploitative fee, allotment of seats to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other socially and economically backward classes and other measures to ensure equity and excellence in professional education and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.WHEREAS, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that where there is more than one minority or non-minority institution or similarly situated institution in the State imparting education in any one discipline, then a single common entrance test followed by centralized counselling or in otherwords single window system of admission is necessary in order to achieve the twin objectives of transparency and merit and further has held that the State can take over the admission procedure to ensure that it is fair, transparent and non-exploitative;AND WHEREAS, it is considered that in the light of the past experiences of mal-administration of the entrance test held by the Consortium/Association of Private Professional Colleges in the State, all institutions of the same or similar type, whether minority or non-minority shall be required to fill their seats on the basis of merit determined through a single common entrance test followed by centralized counselling by the State Commissioner for Entrance Examinations; AND WHEREAS, in the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act, 2005, a provision has been made under clause (5) of Article 15 as follows:-"(5) Nothing in this article or in sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of article 19 shall prevent the State from making any special provision, by law, for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in so far as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30"; AND WHEREAS, the Supreme Court has further held that linguistic and religious minorities are covered by the expression "minority" under Article 30 of the Constitution; AND WHEREAS, the reorganization of the States in India has been made on linguistic lines for the purpose of determining the minority, the unit shall be the State and not the whole of India and therefore, religious and linguistic minorities, who have been put at par in Article 30, have to be considered State-wise; AND WHEREAS, it has been further held by the Supreme Court that Article 30(1) is a sort of guarantee or assurance to the linguistic and religious minority institutions of their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and secularism and equality being two of the basic features of the Constitution, Article 30(1) ensures protection to the linguistic and religious minorities, thereby preserving the secularism of the country; AND WHEREAS, it has been further held that the principles of equality must necessarily apply to the enjoyment of such rights and no law can be framed that will discriminate against such minorities with regard to the establishment and administration of educational institutions vis--vis other educational institutions and any law or rule or regulation that would put the educational institutions run by the minorities at a disadvantage when compared to the institutions run by others, will have to be struck down and at the same time, there also cannot be any reverse discrimination; AND WHEREAS, the essence of Article 30(1) is to ensure equal treatment between the majority and the minority institutions and no one type or category of institution should be disfavoured or, for that matter, receive more favourable treatment than another, since laws of the land, including rules and regulations, must apply equally to the majority institutions as well as to the minority institutions; AND WHEREAS, keeping in mind the above formulation of the Supreme Court on minority rights and also the unique socio-economic and demographic complexion of the State in the context of the need and commitment to protect and strengthen the secular ethos and the long tradition of equitable sharing of the opportunities for education among different communities prevailing in the State, it is necessary to ensure that the benefits that accrue from minority rights be equitably shared among different sections, including weaker sections, within the minority community to which the particular college or institution belongs; AND WHEREAS, it is necessary to provide freeship and scholarship to a large number of economically weaker students to protect and strengthen the State's long tradition of providing equitable opportunities for education at all levels of learning, and to promote social justice in accordance with the directive principles of the Constitution, it is necessary to apply the principle of using the excess funds generated from Non-Resident Indian seats for benefiting students such as students from economically weaker sections of society as enunciated by the Supreme Court as one of the considerations for the fixation of fee by the competent authority appointed for the purpose and to set up a Higher Education Scholarship Fund for providing scholarship to the socially and economically weaker students;
