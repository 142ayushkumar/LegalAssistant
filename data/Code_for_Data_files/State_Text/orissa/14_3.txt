The first measure of this kind was undertaken during the year 1948. Subsequent to that innumerable enactments of the above nature have accumulated in the statute books which need repeal either in whole or in part in order to remove such unnecessary enactments from the statute book. The Bill seeks to achieve the above object. Clauses 3 and 4 have been incorporated in the Bill as a measure of precaution and for determining the effect of repeal."
