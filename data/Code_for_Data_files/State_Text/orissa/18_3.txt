(4) Notwithstanding the issue of a certificate to the Tax Recovery Officer, the assessing authority shall have power to withdraw or correct any clerical or arithmetical mistake in the certificate by sending an intimation to the Tax Recovery Officer. (5) Where an assessee has property within the jurisdiction of more than one Tax Recovery Officer to whom a certificate is sent by an assessing authority :- (a) is not able to recover the entire amount by the sale of the property, whether movable or immovable or both, within his jurisdiction; or (b) is of the opinion that, for the purpose of expediting or securing the recovery of the whole or any part of the amount under this Schedule, it is necessary so to do, he may send the certificate or, where only a part of the amount is to be recovered a copy of certificate certified in the prescribed manner and specifying the amount to be recovered to a Tax Recovery Officer within whose jurisdiction the assessee resides or has property, and thereupon that Tax Recovery Officer shall also proceed to recover the amount under the Schedule as if the certificate or the copy thereof had been a certificate sent to him by the assessing authority. 3.

Purchaser's title -(1) Where property is sold in execution of a certificate, there shall vest in the purchaser merely the right, title and interest of the defaulter at the time of the sale, even though the property itself be specified. (2) Where immovable property is sold in execution of a certificate and such sale has become absolute, the purchaser's right, title and interest shall be deemed to have vested in him from the time when the property is sold, and not from the time when the sale becomes absolute. 8. Suit against purchaser not maintainable on ground of purchase being made on behalf of plaintiff - (1) No suit shall be maintainable against any person claiming title under a purchase certified by the Tax Recovery Officer in the manner laid down in this Part on the ground that the purchase was made on behalf of the plaintiff or on behalf of some one through whom the plaintiff claims. (2) Nothing in this rule shall bar a suit to obtain a declaration that the name of any purchaser certified as aforesaid was inserted in the certificate fraudulently or without the consent of the real purchaser or interfere with the right of a third person to proceed against that property though ostensibly sold to the certified purchaser, on the ground that it is liable to satisfy a claim of such third person against the real owner. 9. Disposal of proceeds of executions - (1) Whenever assets are realised by sale or otherwise in execution of a certificate, they shall be disposed of in the following manner, namely :- (a) there shall first be paid to the assessing authority the costs incurred by him; (b) there shall , in the next place, be paid to the assessing authority the amount due under the certificate in execution of which the assets were realised; (c) if there remains a balance after payment of the sums referred to in clauses (a) and (b), there shall be paid to the assessing authority therefrom any other amount recoverable under the procedure provided by this Act which may be due on the date on which the assets were realised ; and (d) the balance , if any, remaining after the payment of the amount, if any, referred to in clause (c) shall be paid to the defaulter. (2) If the defaulter disputes any claim made by the assessing authority to receive any amount referred to in clause (c), the Tax Recovery Officer shall determine the dispute. 10.

Property exempt from attachment -(1) All such property, as is by the Code of Civil Procedure,1908 exempted from attachment and sale in execution of a decree of Civil Court, shall be exempt from attachment and sale under this Schedule.

(2) Where the property to which the claim or objection applies has been advertised for sale, the Tax Recovery Officer ordering the sale may postpone it, pending the investigation of the claim or objection, upon such terms as to security or otherwise as the Tax Recovery Officer deems fit. (3) The claimant or objector shall adduce evidence to show that - (a) in the case of immovable property, at the date of the service of notice issued under this Schedule to pay the arrears; or (b) in case of movable property, at the date of the attachment, he had some interest in, or was possessed of, the property in question. (4) Where upon the said investigation, the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that, for the reason stated in the claim or objection, such property was not, at the said date, in the possession of the defaulter or of some person in trust for him or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him or that being in the possession of the defaulter at the said date, it was so in his possession, not on his own account or as his own property, but on account of or in trust for some other person, or on his own account and partly on account of some other person, the Tax Recovery Officer shall make an order releasing the property, wholly or to such extent as he thinks fit, from attachment or sale. (5) Where the Tax Recovery Officer is satisfied that the property was, at the said date, in the possession of the defaulter as his own property and not on account of any other person, or was in the possession of some other person in trust for him, or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent to him, the Tax Recovery Officer shall disallow the claim. (6) Where a claim or an objection is preferred, the party against whom an order is made may institute a suit in a Civil Court to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute, but subject to the result of such suit, if any, the order of the Tax Recovery Officer shall be conclusive. 13. Removal of attachment on satisfaction or cancellation of certificate - Where - (a) the amount due with costs and all charges and expenses resulting from the attachment of any property or incurred in order to hold a sale, are paid to the Tax Recovery Officer ; or (b) the certificate is cancelled, the attachment shall be deemed to be withdrawn and in the case of immovable property the withdrawal shall, if the defaulter so desires, be proclaimed at his expense and a copy of the proclamation shall be affixed in the manner provided by this Schedule for a proclamation of sale of immovable property. 14.

(3) Every sale shall be stopped if, before the lot is knocked down, the arrears and costs (including the costs of the sale) are tendered to the Tax Recovery Officer. 17. Private alienation to be void in certain cases - (1) Where a notice has been served on a defaulter under rule 3, the defaulter or his representative in interest shall not be competent to mortgage, charge, lease or otherwise deal with any property belonging to him except with the permission of the Tax Recovery Officer, nor shall any Civil Court issue any process against such property in execution of a decree for the payment of money. (2) Where an attachment has been made under this Schedule, any private transfer or delivery of the property attached or of any interest therein and any payment to the defaulter of any debt, dividend or other moneys contrary to such attachment, shall be void as against all claims enforceable under the attachment. 18.

Special provisions relating to growing crops -(1) Where the property to be sold is a growing crop and the crop from its nature admits of being stored but has not yet been stored, the day of the sale shall be so fixed as to admit of the crop being made ready for storing before the arrival of such day, and the sale shall not be held until the crop has been cut or gathered and is ready for storing. (2) Where the crop from its nature does not admit of being stored or can be sold to a greater advantage in an unripe stage, as in the case of green wheat, it may be sold before it is cut and gathered, and the purchaser shall be entitled to enter on the land, and to do all that is necessary for the purpose of tending or cutting or gathering the crop. 42. Sale to be by public auction -The property shall be sold by public auction in one or more lots as the Tax Recovery Officer may consider advisable and if the amount to be realised by sale is satisfied by the sale of a portion of the property, the sale shall be immediately stopped with respect to the remainder of the lots. 43.
