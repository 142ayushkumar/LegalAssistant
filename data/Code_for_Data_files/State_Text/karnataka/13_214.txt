Mysore Palace (Acquisition and Transfer) Act, 1998_Section Preamble--> State(s): Karnataka An Act to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the Mysore Palace and open space around it in the public interest and for its preservation and for matters connected therewith. Whereas, the Palace at Mysore popularly known as the Mysore Palace, a unique historical, architectural and cultural heritage of Karnataka in particular and of the Nation in general, with its immediate surroundings, including the open space, park and the garden around it, the Royal Treasure including the Royal Thrones, Royal Crowns, the Howdah, Royal Wears and ornaments and all other pieces of art, regalia, paintings, sculptures and furniture, is required for maintaining its public character: for preserving its identity as centre of the Dasara Festivity in Karnataka renowned worldwide for its cultural heritage and as a monument in its own Majesty and splendour for developing it as an exclusive Museum of Royal Treasure, paintings and pieces of art and architecture; and to preserve the park and garden and to develop the open space as a horticultural garden, to serve the public purpose and therefore to provide for its acquisition and transfer by law. Whereas, the competent authority under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 has held that the Mysore Palace and surrounding land came within the regulation of the said Act and has passed an order declaring substantial portion of the land surrounding the Mysore Palace as surplus land to be surrendered to the State Government and the said order is upheld in appeal before the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal. Whereas, the legal representatives and heirs of late Jayachamarajendra Wadeyar have in some writ petitions questioned the legality of the order passed by the Appellate Authority and these writ petitions are pending before the High Court of Karnataka. Whereas, the legal representatives and heirs of late Jayachamarajendra Wadeyar had in their letters dated 18-8-1975, 3-9-1975, 7-2-1976 and 10-2-1976 requested the State Government to take over the possession of the Palace other than the portion of the Palace in which they are residing and accordingly the State Government took possession of the portion of Palace at Mysore with movables by issuing a Government Order No. GAD 2 PSR 76, dated 26-2-1976 and has thereafter spent considerable amounts for maintenance of the Palace as a Public monument and for preserving its public character as it was also the desire of late Jayachamarajendra Wadeyar that the Mysore Palace and the Royal Treasure, jewellery and other articles should be maintained for public purpose, and one of the heirs in a writ petition questioned the legality of the order of the State Government and the writ petition was allowed by the High Court of Karnataka and an appeal filed there against in the Supreme Court by the State Government has come to be dismissed on Twenty-first April, 1998. Whereas, preliminary notifications under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for acquisition of land surrounding the Palace under No. LAQ/ SR/51 / 86-87, dated 1-7-1986, were issued and some of the legal representatives and heirs of late Jayachamarajendra Wadeyar had questioned the same by filing writ petitions in the High Court of Karnataka and the High Court had stayed all proceedings and now these writ petitions have been withdrawn. Whereas, for the purposes herein before stated, it is expedient to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the Mysore Palace including the park, garden and open space around it, the Royal Treasure including the Royal Thrones, Royal Crowns, Royal Wears, the Howdah and ornaments and all other pieces of art, regalia, paintings, sculptures and furniture belonging to or found in the Palace, by appropriate legislation different from the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and to make provision for determining the amount payable in respect of the entire holding having regard to the final decision in the aforesaid writ petitions in which the orders passed under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 are challenged.
