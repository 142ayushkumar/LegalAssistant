Karnataka Civil Services (Exclusion of the Service Rendered by a Government Servant as a Local Candidate for Computing the Service for Grant of Selection Time Scale of Pay) Act, 1986_Section Preamble--> State(s): Karnataka An Act to provide for exclusion of the service rendered by a Government servant as a local candidate for grant of selection time scale of pay. Whereas, in Government Order No. FD 37 SRP (1) 71, dated 22nd February, 1971, the scheme of grant of selection time scale to certain categories of Government servants who had completed specified years of service in one cadre without promotion was introduced with effect from 1st January, 1970 in order to provide some relief to Government servants on account of stagnation owing to inadequate promotional opportunities in that cadre; And whereas, in Government Order No. ED 199 PMC 71, dated 13th October, 1972, the Government extended the benefit of selection time scale of pay to primary school teachers also; And whereas, one of the conditions laid down in Para 5(d) of Government Order No. ED 199 PMC 71, dated 13th October, 1972 is that the service rendered by a Government servant as a local candidate shall not count for computing the service for grant of said benefit; And whereas, in Writ Petitions No. 10169 to 10171 and 13450 to 13549 of 1977, the High Court of Karnataka has held that the conditions to exclude the service rendered by a Government servant as local candidate in Para 5(d) of Government Order No. ED 199 PMC 71, dated 13th October, 1972 was contrary to statutory rules and was unenforceable; And whereas, it was never the intention of the State Government to include the service rendered by Government servant as local candidate for computing the service for grant of the selection time scale of pay, as that would result in junior Government servant getting the benefit of the higher scale of pay than the senior; And whereas, it is necessary to spell out the intention to exclude the service rendered by a Government servant as local candidate for computing the service for grant of selection time scale of pay; Be it enacted by the Karnataka State Legislature in the Thirty- sixth Year of the Republic of India as follows -
