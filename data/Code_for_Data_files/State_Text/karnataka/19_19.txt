Whereas, the Karnataka Tax on Entry of Goods into a Local Area for Consumption, Use or Sale therein Act, 1979 (Karnataka Act 27 of 1979) was enacted to compensate the loss of income of the local authorities as a result of the abolition of octroi with effect from the First day of April, 1979; Whereas, the said Act was struck down by the High Court of Karnataka in Writ Petition No. 7039 of 1979 and connected cases on the ground that it did not provide for granting exemption from payment of tax to petty dealers; Whereas, as a result of the striking down of the said law, the State was deprived of an expected income of about two lakhs of rupees per day and it was necessary to make provision to augment the revenues of the State to make the intended grants to the local authorities in the State to enable them to proceed with their developmental activities and also to augment the resources of the State; Whereas, for the said purpose the Karnataka Tax on Entry of Goods into a Local Area for Consumption, Use or Sale therein Act, 1980 (Karnataka Act 21 of 1980) was enacted without repealing the above said 1979 Act; Whereas, on an appeal filed by the State Government in Civil Appeal No. 3094 of 1979 against the aforesaid decision of the High Court of Karnataka, the Supreme Court of India upheld the validity of the above said 1979 Act reversing the judgment of the High Court; Whereas, as a result of the said judgment of the Supreme Court both the above said 1979 Act and the 1980 Act are in force in the State of Karnataka and it has become necessary to repeal one of the said two Acts; Whereas, it is considered desirable to repeal the above said 1980 Act with retrospective effect and keep the said 1979 Act in force from the date of its enactment. Now, therefore, be it enacted by the Karnataka State Legislature in the Thirty-second Year of the Republic of India as follows:
