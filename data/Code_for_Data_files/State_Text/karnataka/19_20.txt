Karnataka Tax on Entry of Goods into a Local Area for Consumption, use or Sale Therein Act, 1980_Section Preamble--> State(s): Karnataka An Act to provide for the levy of tax on entry of certain goods into a local area for consumption, use or sale therein. Whereas, the Karnataka Tax on Entry of Goods into Local Areas for Consumption, Use or Sale therein Act, 1979 was enacted to levy a tax on entry of certain goods into a local area mainly with a view to compensate the loss of income of the local authorities resulted by the abolition of the levy of octroi with effect from 1st day of April, 1979; And whereas, the High Court struck down the said Act on the ground that it did not provide for granting exemption from payment of tax to petty dealers and the appeal filed by the State Government against the said decision is pending in the Supreme Court; And whereas, as a result of the striking down of the said Act the State is deprived of an expected income of about two lakhs of rupees per day and it has become impossible for the Government to make any grants to the local authorities which are finding it difficult to carry out their obligatory and other functions; And whereas, pending decision of the Supreme Court it is necessary to make provision to augment the revenues of the State to enable it to make the intended grants to the local authorities in the State so that they may carry out their obligatory functions and other developmental activities; And whereas, for the aforesaid purpose it is considered expedient to levy tax on the entry of certain goods into certain local areas in the State for consumption, use or sale therein and to exempt certain small dealers from payment of the said tax; Be it enacted by the Karnataka State Legislature in the Thirty-first year of the Republic of India as follows:-
