Karnataka Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Determination of Fee) Act, 2006_Section Preamble--> State(s): Karnataka An Act to provide for regulation of admission and determination of fee in professional educational institutions in the State of Karnataka and to provide for reservation of seats to persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes in the seats in professional educational institutions. Whereas the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its judgement in Islamic Academy of Education and others Vs State of Karnataka, reported in (2003) 6 SCC 697, sought to regulate admissions to professional courses through two committees, one for overseeing admissions and the other for approving the fee structure in professional educational institutions, pending enactment of appropriate lay by the Parliament. And whereas the Supreme Court in P.A. Inamdar and Others Vs State of Maharashtra reported in (2005) 6 SCC 537 has held that where there is more than one minority or non minority institution or similarly situated institution in the State imparting education in any one discipline then a single common entrance test followed by centralised counseling, or in other words, single window system of admission is necessary in order to achieve the twin objectives of transparency and merit. All institutions of the same or similar type, whether minority or non minority institutions will therefore be required to fill their seats through a single common entrance test followed by centralised counseling. Further the Apex Court in the same judgement has held that the State can regulate admission by providing a centralized and single window procedure, which will ensure fair and merit based admissions and prevent maladministration. If the admission procedure followed by the private institutions fails to satisfy all or any of the triple tests prescribed by the Court, the admission procedure can be taken over by the State substituting its own procedure. And whereas, in the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act, 2005, a provision has been made under article 15(5) as follows:- "(5) Nothing in this article or in sub-clause (g) of clause (1) of article 19 shall prevent the State from making any special provision, by law, for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in so far as such special provisions relate to their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30." In order to achieve the above object and for the purposes hereinafter appearing it is considered necessary and expedient to provide for the following: Be it enacted by the Karnataka State Legislature in the fifty-seventh year of the Republic of India, as follows:-
