The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Rajasthan Sales Tax (Amendment) Bill, 1978 (Rajasthan Gazette, Extraordinary, Part 3(A), dated the October 5, 1978, page 64.), runs as follows : "Though section 14 of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act does not prohibit an assessing authority from filing a revision against his own order to the Board of Revenue, yet this provision has not been interpreted in keeping with the intention of the Legislature by the Board. To make the position clear and beyond doubt, it was considered necessary to add an explanation to the said section with retrospective effect. Since the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly was not in session, the Governor made and promulgated the Rajasthan Sales Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, 1978 (See 1978 42 S.T.C. Statutes 11.), on 28-5-78. This Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance."
