Rajasthan Special Courts Act, 2012_Section Preamble--> State(s): Rajasthan An Act to provide for the constitution of Special Courts for the speedy trial of certain class of offences and for confiscation of the properties involved. Whereas corruption is perceived to be amongst the persons holding public offices and public servants within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 in the State of Rajasthan; And whereas the Government has sufficient reasons to believe that large number of persons, who have held or are holding public offices and are public servants within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 have accumulated vast property, disproportionate to their known sources of income by resorting to corrupt means; And whereas it is obligation of the State to prosecute persons involved in such corrupt practices and confiscate their ill gotten assets; And whereas the existing Courts of Special Judges cannot reasonably be expected to bring the trials, arising out of those prosecutions, to a speedy termination and it is imperative for the efficient functioning of a parliamentary democracy and the institutions created by or under the Constitution of India that the aforesaid offenders should be tried with utmost dispatch; And whereas it is necessary for the said purpose to establish Special Courts to be presided over by the persons who are or have been Sessions Judges or Additional Sessions Judges and it is also expedient to make some procedural changes whereby avoidable delay in the final determination of the guilt or innocence, of the persons to be tried, is eliminated without interfering with the right to a fair trial; Be it enacted by the Rajasthan State Legislature in the Sixty-third Year of the Republic of India, as follows:-
