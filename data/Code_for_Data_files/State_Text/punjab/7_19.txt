The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Punjab General Sales Tax (Second Amendment) Bill, 1976 (Punjab Government Gazette, Extraordinary, dated 9th September, 1976, page 1770.), runs as follows : "Under the existing provisions of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948, the taxable quantum of manufacturers is Rs. 10,000. Keeping in view the escalation of input costs and in order to save the small manufacturers from the botheration of filling returns and maintaining registers and accounts this taxable quantum was raised from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 40,000 through an Ordinance published on 20th July, 1976 (See page 102 supra.). The Bill is designed to replace the Ordinance. 2. Besides it is proposed to substitute the existing sub-section (6) of section 10 of the Act ibid in order to empower the Assessing Authorities to levy penalty for failure to deposit tax due according to the returns filed before finalising the assessment proceedings. The existing provision authorises levy of penalty only after the assessment order is passed. Hence this Bill."
