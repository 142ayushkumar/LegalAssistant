Local area not recorded as a revenue estate, does not fall within definition of village. Public Street - Pathway is included in term 'Public Street' - Gram Panchayat has jurisdiction to order removal of encroachment from such public street. So long as public has a right to use the Blind alley, the same is covered by definition of "public street". Distinction Between Common Land and Public Place:-The expression common land refers to every kind of land reserved for common purposes of village community or acquired for such purposes but not in the exclusive possession of any particular individual. In order that a place falling within the definition of expression common land may be covered by covered by the definition of public place the additional requisite of its so falling within the scope of the latter as to the public in general having free access to it has to be satisfied. Public place may be covered by the definition of common land but every piece of common land is not a public place. It is only in respect of those places of land, which not only satisfy the test of sine qua non of the definition of the public place of free access to such land by public in general that the place could be covered by the definition of public place. Unless it is shown on behalf of the Gram Panchayat that the site in dispute is a public place, the Gram Panchayat has no jurisdiction to proceed against a person on the ground of the site in dispute being the public place. In other words, existence of public place is a condition precedent for exercise of jurisdiction by the Gram Panchayat.

NOTES Right to be Elected Panch is not a Fundamental Right:-Te right to get elected as a Panch is a civil right and not a fundamental right guaranteed by Constitution. Reservation for Scheduled Caste :-One seat was reserved for Scheduled Castes, but no Scheduled Caste was living in the village, this does not vitiate the entire election. The reserves cold be filled from general category. Technical Breach of Election Rules:-The election of Panches and Sarpanches cannot be set aside by the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the constitution of India, there nothing more than a technical breach of an election rule has occurred and no real prejudice has been proved to have been caused to the petitioner. Election not to be Set Aside on Mere Technicalities:-An election is a time consuming process involving of a lot of expense. If it is established that the voters have been able to make their choice in a free manner, the elections should not be set aside on mere technicalities. A Court of Law charged with the duty of determining the validity of an election must lean in favour of the Will of the people. This principal is firmly established in our system of law relating to election. Section 100 of the Representation of People Act, 1951, also provides that the election of returned candidate can be declared void on account of any non-compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or of the Act or the rules framed thereunder only if such non-compliance with the statutory provisions has materially affected the result of the election. Election Petition-Maintainability:-The Plea on basis of which the election is to be satisfied should be precise and exact. In case of vague plea the election petition is to be rejected out right. In case one plea fails the election petition can be allowed on the basis of the other plea. Single Election Petition for both Sarpanch and Panch:-The Challenge to election of Sarpanch on the ground that a particular Panch was not duly elected and therefore net entitled to participate in election of Sarpanch depends on determination whether that Panch was duly elected or not. Two causes of action being so inextricably mixed up and inter-related that they must be treated as forming one composite cause of action. Single election petition both against Sarpanch and Panch is competent. Restoration of election petition dismissed in default:-Every election petition is to be tried, as nearly as possible in accordance with the procedure applicable under Code of Civil Procedure to the trial suits. In Election petition dismissed in default is to be restore where reasonable cause is soon by the petitioner. Scheduled Caste candidates not joined in election process-effect:-Where Scheduled Caste candidates or non-Scheduled Caste candidates not allowed to join election process and election held amongst remaining candidates. It is similar position to improper rejection of nomination pagers. Result of election materially affected ipso facto. Fresh poll ordered while accepting election petition. Meeting-Quorum:-Meetings in absence of quorum are not valid. A meeting convent to consider motion of no confidence against Sarpanch without prescribed quorum is no meeting. Meeting-Absence of quorum:-A meeting convened to consider motion of no-confidence against Sarpanch. Prescribed quorum not present. No meeting since no quorum. The motion of no-confidence at adjourned meeting cannot be carried by a majority of members present. Statutory requirement that majority of members constituting Gram Panchayat should vote for motion of no-confidence must be satisfied. Removal of Sarpanch and Panches without notice and enquiry:-The power to remove any Panch, is to be exercise "after such enquiry as it may deem fit" and where on the material placed before the High court, the only finding possible was that there had been no enquiry as contemplated by the Statute before the Sarpanch and the Panches were removed, it quashed the orders of removal of the Sarpanch and the Panches. Removal of Sarpanch-Order should be speaking order:-It was his duty to confine the consideration of the material available against the Sarpanch only to the charges which had been leveled against him and which had been made the subject-matter of the notice. While acting on the report the Deputy Commissioner did not look into it and passed a mechanical order accepting it in toto. Had he perused it, he would have at once seen that it went beyond the scope of the charges and would not have taken into consideration that part of it which was not germane to the enquiry entrusted to the Enquiry Officer. Inasmuch as the order of removal of the Sarpanch is not a "speaking order" and has been passed without giving any real consideration to the charges leveled against the Sarpanch and the findings arrived at thereon by he Enquiry Officer, it is liable to be quashed.

He intended not to enforce the lease if he had actually succeeded in the election as Panch and would have taken over the lands as a lessee only if he had failed to get elected. Held that, the candidate had become a lessee under the Gram Panchayat Act and was disqualified from contesting the election.
