Whereas phenomenal increase in the population owing to migration has put tremendous pressure on land and infrastructure in Punjab resulting in developments which are not in consonance with the master plan of cities and towns and the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulations Act, 1995, in the State; Whereas the Government has constituted a Committee of Experts to look into the various aspects of unauthorized colonies and suggest a comprehensive strategy to deal with them; Whereas a strategy is proposed to be prepared by the Government in the State of Punjab in accordance with the Punjab Housing and Habitat Policy for Urban Housing to all; Whereas action for violation of the provisions of the Punjab Regional and Town Planning and Development Act, 1995 and the Punjab Apartment and Property Regulations Act, 1995, is causing avoidable hardship and irreparable loss to a large number of people; Whereas some time is required for making orderly arrangements for solving problems of areas under unauthorized colonies; Whereas it is expedient to have a law to provide temporary relief to the people of the State of Punjab against such action for a period of one year within which various policy issues referred to above are expected to be finalized; And whereas the Punjab Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2013, was enacted for a period of one year from the date of its commencement and the said period of one year has expired on the 16th April, 2014.
