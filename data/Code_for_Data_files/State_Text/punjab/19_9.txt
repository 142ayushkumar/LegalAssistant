Punjab Termination of Agreement Act, 2004_Section Preamble--> State(s): Punjab An Act to provide for terminating and discharging the Government of Punjab from its obligations under the Agreement dated 31st December, 1981 and all other agreements relating to the waters of the rivers Ravi and Beas in public interest. Whereas, the State of Punjab is proud of its position in the Indian Union and has equal concern for its neighbours and as a sovereign authority, the State of Punjab considers it its bounden duty to uphold the Constitution and the laws and to protect the interests of its inhabitants; Whereas, what was known as Indus system before the partition of the country, became irrelevant after partition, since only three east flowing rivers, namely, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, out of the six rivers constituting the said system remained within Indian territory for its exclusive use; Whereas, while all the three rivers, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej flow through the territory of the present State of Punjab, none of them flow through either the State of Haryana or the State of Rajasthan; Whereas, no part of territories of the States of Haryana and Rajasthan falls within the basin areas of the rivers Ravi and Beas; Whereas, even according to the Irrigation Commission only 9,939 sq. km. of areas within Haryana fall within the Indus Basin (not within the Ravi and Beas basin), as against 50304 sq. km. areas within Punjab; Whereas, present utilisation by Haryana is about 5.95 MAF of water (about 4.33 MAF from Sutlej and about 1.62 MAF from Ravi and Beas); Whereas, Punjabs claim of its share in Yamuna water has been turned down even though parts of Punjab fall within Yamuna basin; Whereas, even though the States of Haryana and Rajasthan are neither riparian nor basin States, they have continued to utilise the waters of rivers Ravi and Beas; Whereas, the State of Punjab as a good neighbour accepted such utilisations by the States of Haryana and Rajasthan as usages by sufferance, but not as a matter of any recognition of their rights; Whereas, the States of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan entered into an agreement on 31st December, 1981 allocating 3.5 MAF of water to Haryana and 8.60 MAF of water to Rajasthan out of the surplus flow of the rivers Ravi and Beas, then estimated at 17.17 MAF based on 1921-1960 flow series; Whereas, no reliable and scientific study of hydrological, ecological and sociological impact of such large scale trans-basin diversion from Punjab to Haryana and Rajasthan had been undertaken; Whereas, diversion of water on such a large scale from the donor deficit basin of Ravi and Beas to the surplus basin of the Yamuna river is contrary to national water policy guidelines; Whereas, such a huge trans-basin diversion of water is likely to have permanent adverse impact on the irrigation and other requirements within the basin areas of Punjab rendering about 9 lakh acres of the basin areas dry and barren; Whereas, in the wake of large scale militancy in Punjab, the Punjab Settlement was reached, which however, remained unimplemented in letter and spirit; Whereas, the total availability of waters in the rivers Ravi and Beas has reduced from 17.17 MAF (assumed under the Agreement dated 31t December, 1981) to 14.37 MAF as per the flow series of 1981-2002; Whereas, under the Yamuna Agreement dated 12th May, 1994, Haryana has been allocated 4.65 MAF of water which will be further augmented by the Sarda Yamuna Link. Whereas, there is material and substantial change in ground realities adverse to the interests of Punjab; Whereas, in the circumstances, the terms of the said Agreement dated 31 st December, 1981 have become onerous, unfair, unreasonable and contrary to the interest of the inhabitants of the Ravi Beas basin, who have lawful rights to utilise the water of the rivers Ravi and Beas; Whereas, being conscious of the legal position that the obligations arising from an Agreement or a contract do not fetter the powers of the Legislature to enact a law in public interest; AND Whereas, in these circumstances, it is expedient to enact a law in public interest and in the interests of the inhabitants of the basin areas of the State of Punjab, terminating the Agreement dated 31st December, 1981 and all other agreements relating to Ravi Beas waters and to discharge the Government of Punjab from the obligations thereunder; Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Punjab in the Fifty-fifth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-
