Hyderabad or Madhya Pradesh] and which now form the State of Maharashtra, or]. (j) any other written grant by the British Government expressly creating or confirming such exemption, or (k) a judgement by Court of law, or an adjudication duly passed by a competent officer under 25 Bombay Regulation XVII of 1827, Chapter X, or under 26 Act No. XI of 1852 27 [or any other law for time being in force], which declares the particular property in dispute to be exempt, such claim shall be cognizable in the Civil Courts. ILLUSTRATION TO (H) (1) It is enacted that, in the event if the proprietary right in lands, the property of Government being transferred to individuals, they shall be permitted to hold the lands for ever at the assessment at which they are transferred. The proprietary right in certain lands is transferred to A at an assessment of Rs. 100. An exemption from higher assessment not before existing is expressly created in favour of A by enactment, and he may seek relief in the Civil Court against over-assessment. (2) It is enacted that, when a specific limit to assessment has been established and preserved, the assessment shall not exceed such specific limit. A is the owner of land worth Rs. 100 for assessment. He claims to be assessed at Rs. 50 only on the strength of a course of dealing with him and his predecessors under which his land has not been more highly assessed. There is no exemption not before existing created by enactment, and As claim is not cognisable in a Civil Court. (3) It is enacted that land-revenue shall not be leviable from any land held and entered in the land-registers as exempt. A claims to hold certain land as exempt on the ground that it has been so held by him, and is so entered in the land register. This is an exemption expressly confirmed by enactment on the ground of its being shown in a public record, and As claim is cognizable in a Civil Court. (4) It is enacted that the Collector shall confirm existing exemptions of all lands shown in certain maps to be exempt. A claims exemption, alleging that his land is shown in the maps to be exempt. As claim is cognizable in a Civil Court. (5) It is enacted that assessment shall be fixed with reference to certain considerations and not with reference to others. This is not an enactment creating an exemption in favour of any individual or class, and no objection to an assessment under such an enactment is cognizable in a Civil Court.
