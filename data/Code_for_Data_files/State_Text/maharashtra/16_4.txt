Pandharpur Temples Act, 1973_Section Sch.1--> State(s): Maharashtra [See section 2(g)] Description of daily or nitya services in the temple of God Vitthal All those who have to render services in the morning have to be present clad in silken clothes which are considered to be holy, after having their bath in the temple of God Vitthal At about 4-00 a.m. the door of the Chowkhambi Hall in which the bed-chamber is situated, is opened with a key. Standing with folded hands, the person opening the door begs of the deity to awake and arise. After entering the bed-chamber, he removes the remnants of the naivedya offered the previous night, closes the door of that chamber, enters the sanctum and offers butter and sugarcandy to the idol of Vitthal. Kakad-aarti 2. Then starts the ritual of kakad-arati. A thick wick, soaked in ghee or clarified butter (called 'kakada') is waved before the idol of God Vitthal and all those present sing songs in praise of the God. When this is over a naivedya of butter and sugarcandy is offered to the idol, the kakada or the lighted wick is waved again but without accompaniment of songs, and the kakada is brought out, and circulated among all the persons present who signify with their hands in token of having partaken of the grace carried by the lighted wick. Padya-puja 3. After the kakad-arati is over, the ritual of padya-puja starts. After waving lighted incense sticks or agarbattis, a light naivedya is offered to the idol of God Vitthal after which the idol is unrobed after removal of the garlands of flowers. Then starts the maha-puja. It is a shodashopchar puja. Maha-puja 4. Amidst recitation of Vedic hymns purushsukta, the deity is bathed with the water followed by a bath with five nectars milk, curds, honey, ghee and sugar followed by plain and scented water. Twice a week on Wednesday and Sunday, the idol of God Vitthal is anointed with oil and rubbed with sugar and water to remove the film of oil. After the bath is over, the idol is wiped clean by the person incharge of puja with a piece of cloth, and is dressed for the morning. Scent is applied and mirror is shown holding it in front of the idol. This is followed by naivedya or the offering of eatables, and then a lighted "ekarti" or a thin lighted wick is waved before the idol. After the light is shown it is taken outside and waved before several other Devatas called Pariwar Devatas. During the ekarti, the devotional songs are sung. This ritual ends a little after sunrise; and from 7-00 a.m. to 11-00 a.m. after the "arati", the idol of Vitthal is open to the public for having darshan. Maha-naivedya 5. At mid-day, the maha-naivedya or the offering of food, consisting of puris rice, dal, vegetables and five types of sweets, prepared in the special kitchen of the God, is made to the deity. Except the offering of maha-naivedya, there is no ritual; but at the time of this maha-naivedya itself, several persons bring food prepared at their houses, place it for a few seconds before the idol of God Vitthal and take it home. Afternoon change of dress 6. At about 3 or 4 p.m. the idol is given a change of dress. It is adorned with ornaments only on special occasions; otherwise only the minimum daily ornaments are placed on the idol. The God is dressed, it is suggested, to receive the devotees in the afternoon. After dressing the idol, a naivedya of laddus or sweet-balls is offered to the idol, presumably as afternoon repast. Dhuparti 7. Between 4 p.m and evening, the idol of Vitthal is open for darshan to devotees. In the evening at about sunset, the ritual of dhuparti takes place. An incense burner with incense is lighted and amidst sound of bells and cymbals songs are sung. Flowers are offered after washing the feet of the idol. At the dhuparti time also, a light naivedya is offered. Shejarti 8. Between 10 and 11 p.m. the shejarti ritual takes place and this attracts a large crowd. Water is sprinkled on the floor between the throne of the idol and the bed-chamber, it is swept and a cloth called paulghadi is spread on it. The door of the bed-chamber is opened, the bed is arranged a lamp is lighted and a bowl of hot milk and a spittoon are placed at God's feet. The feet of the idol are washed. Hymns are chanted and after ekarti hymns, and after ekarti or a thin lighted wick is waved, the idol is undressed. After offering of flower, etc., the God is supposed to enter the antechamber, and all leave the place. Upachars on Ekadashis 9. The routine of nitya puja and upachars stated above varies on Ekadashis which occur twice a month, being the 11th day of the bright half and 11th day of the dark half of the lunar month. The naivdya offered on these days is of articles considered to be permissible to be taken on Ekadashi, and as God Vitthal is not supposed to sleep on the night of the Ekadashi, no shejarti, and consequently no kakadarti on the following morning takes place, since the God does not require to be awakened. Note.- (1) Of the 24 Ekadashis in a year, four are important when waris or groups of pilgrims who regularly visit, come to Pandharpur. They ar Ashadhi, Kartiki, Maghi and Chaitri-Ekadashis. The first two attract a large number of pilgrims in lacs. If is a leap year which is generally the every third year, in which there is an extra month called Adhikmas, the Ekadashi of that month also attracts a large number of pilgrims as Adhikmas is regarded as a holy month. (2) There are other festivals observed besides the Ekadashi and they are Ram-navmi, Narsinha Jayanti, Gokul Ashtami or Janmashtami and Mahashivratri. Though Vitthal is considered to be the form of Vishnu and, therefore, the temple a Vaishnav temple to Bhagwat Sampradaya, the Mahashivratri which is a day consecrated to Shiva is also important and is observed, a fact distinguishing Bhaktimarg which the temple of the God Vitthal propagates. After the waris or fairs are over, a prakshal puja is held. Temple of Goddess Rukmini and other Devatas In the temple of the Goddess Rukmini, the consort of God Vitthal the same nitya rituals take place soon after their performances in the temple of God Vitthal presumably to provide an opportunity to the devotees to attend and witness rituals in both the Temples. While there is no substantial difference in the nitya upachars in both the Temples on special occasions, those appropriate for the female deity are in vogue in the temple of Goddess Rukmini. There are also female pariwar Devatas of Rukmini, Satyabhama and Rahi or Radhika and the Pariwar Devatas of God Vitthal where nitya pujas are performed.
