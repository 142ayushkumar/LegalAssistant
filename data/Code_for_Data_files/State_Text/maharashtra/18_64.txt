Maharashtra State Reservation (of seats for admission in educational institutions in the State and for appointments or posts in the public services under the State) for Educationally and Socially Backward Category (ESBC) Act, 2014_Section Preamble--> State(s): Maharashtra An Act to provide for reservation of seats for admission in educational institutions in the State and of appointments or posts in public services under the State to Educationally and Socially Backward Category (ESBC) in the State of Maharashtra for their advancement and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Whereas the policy of reservation for the educational and social advancement of people belonging to the backward classes of citizens in admissions to educational institutions in the State and for reservation of appointments or posts in public services under the State has been under implementation in the State of Maharashtra since formation of the Maharashtra State; And Whereas the two notifications, providing for reservation of seats in public employment were issued in the Karveer State (Kolhapur) in the year 1902, on the 26th July 1902 and the 2nd August 1902, respectively, by Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, who is known as the father of the concept of reservation in India, and from whom Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar got inspiration to make provisions for reservation in the Constitution of India, and in the said two notifications of 1902, reservation was provided to Backward Classes wherein Maratha community was also included; And Whereas by Resolution of the then Government of Bombay, dated the 23rd April 1942, about 228 communities including Maratha and other castes were declared as intermediate and Backward community and Maratha community is shown at serial number 149 in the list annexed to the said Resolution; And Whereas the matter of Maratha reservation was referred to the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes for their recommendations in the year 2004 and the State Backward Classes Commission had submitted its 22nd Report on the 28th July 2008 stating therein that such reservation cannot be given to the Maratha community in the category of "Other Backward Classes"; And Whereas the Cabinet Sub-Committee after detailed discussion referred the matter back to the State Backward Classes Commission asking for its report on inadequacy of the quantifiable data on educational and social backwardness of the Maratha community and also was requested to give its opinion on whether Maratha community could be given reservation without touching the present structure of reservation; And Whereas after repeated request to submit the report, the State Backward Classes Commission insisted only on taking decision as per sub-section (2) of section 9 of the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 2005 on the 22nd Report of the State Backward Classes Commission; And Whereas the Government appointed the Rane Committee who had submitted adequate quantifiable data pertaining to the backwardness of Maratha community and thereafter the State Backward Classes Commission was again requested to offer its remarks on the issue of providing reservation to Educationally, Socially and Economically Backward Maratha community without affecting the present reservation of Other Backward Classes; And Whereas the State Backward Classes Commission by its letter dated the 20th May 2014 requested the Government to take decision on the 22nd Report of the Commission; And Whereas on the above backdrop there was a scope to believe that the State Backward Classes Commission was reluctant to take decision in the matter and hence, the Government decided to take decision after waiting for almost a decade and the Government, in its Cabinet meeting held on the 25th June 2014 decided, to partly reject the 22nd report of the Commission and with certain modifications accepted that Maratha community is Educationally and Socially Backward and hence, eligible for reservation, by virtue of sub-section (2) of section 9 of the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes Act, 2005; And Whereas the Government of Maharashtra was of the view on the basis of material and data collected by the Rane Committee that Maratha community is Socially, Educationally and Economically Backward and inadequately represented in services under the State, hence, require reservation in employment and reservation for admissions in the educational institutions; And Whereas clause (4) of Article 15 of the Constitution of India enables the State to make any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens; And Whereas clause (5) of Article 15 of the Constitution of India enables the State to make any special provision, by law, for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens in so far as such special provision relate to their admission to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or un-aided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution of India; And Whereas clause (4) of Article 16 of the Constitution of India enables the State to make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State; And Whereas even otherwise Articles 15(4), 15(5), 16(4) and 46 of the Constitution of India enable the State to provide reservation to a separate class; And Whereas the State of Maharashtra has enacted the Maharashtra State Public Services (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, De-notified Tribes (Vimukta Jatis), Nomadic Tribes, Special Backward Category and Other Backward Classes) Act, 2001 in pursuance of clause (4) of Article 16 of the Constitution; And Whereas the Maharashtra State was of the view that on the basis of material and data collected by the Rane Committee that Maratha community is Socially, Educationally and Economically Backward and inadequately represented in services under the State, hence, require special provision for their advancement; And Whereas the State Government had, after careful consideration, taken a policy decision to create a new category namely Educationally and Socially Backward Category (ESBC) and, there should be a separate sixteen percent reservation for such newly created Educationally and Socially Backward Category (ESBC) and, the Maratha community was included in the said category, without affecting the then existing fifty-two percent reservation applicable in the State, in admissions to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or un-aided by the State, other than minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution of India, and in appointments or posts in public services under the State, excluding reserved in favour of the Scheduled Tribes candidates in the Scheduled Areas of the State under the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India, as per the notification issued on the 9th June 2014 in this behalf; And Whereas both Houses of the State Legislature were not in session; And Whereas the Governor of Maharashtra was satisfied that circumstances existed which rendered it necessary for him to take immediate action to make a law to create a new Educationally and Socially Backward Category (ESBC) and to provide sixteen percent separate reservation for Educationally and Socially Backward Category (ESBC) in which Maratha community is included under this category, without affecting the then existing fifty-two percent reservation applicable in the State, in admissions to educational institutions including private educational institutions, whether aided or un-aided by the State, other than minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution of India, and in appointments or posts in public services under the State, excluding reservation in favour of the Scheduled Tribes candidates in the Scheduled Areas of the State under the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of India, as per the notification issued on the 9th June 2014 in this behalf, for their advancement and for the matters connected therewith or incidental thereto;
