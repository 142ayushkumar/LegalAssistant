(ii) Where on an application being made by any contractor in this behalf, the Commissioner is satisfied that the contract under reference is separable and involves both a works contract and labour or is not a works contract and therefore justifies deduction of tax only as a part of the sum payable in respect of any works contract or, as the case may be, justifies no deduction at all, he shall grant him such certificate as may be appropriate.

In the event of such certificate being cancelled or modified as provided, the employer shall make the deductions accordingly. (2) For the purpose of this section where any amount of tax referred to in sub-section (1) is credited to any account whether called the "suspense account" or by any other name, in the books of accounts of the employer, such crediting shall be deemed to be credit of such tax to the account of the employer and the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly. (3) Any registered dealer who is not covered as an employer under the said notification may apply to the Commissioner for making the provisions relating to employers applicable to him and subject to such conditions and restrictions as may be prescribed, the Commissioner by order in writing accept the request.

(5) Any employer deducting any sum in accordance with this section, shall pay within the prescribed time, the sum so deducted to the credit of the State Government. If the employer does not deduct or after deducting fails to pay the tax as required by this section, he shall be deemed not to have paid the tax within the time he is required by or under the provisions of this Act to pay it and all the provisions of this Act including the provisions relating to interest shall apply mutatis mutandis to such unpaid tax. (6) The power to recover tax by deduction at source shall be without prejudice to any other mode of recovery. (7) Every person deducting tax in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall within such periods as may be prescribed, furnish to the person to whose account the credit of the tax is to be given under this section, a certificate in the prescribed form. (8) Every employer shall in the prescribed time apply to the Commissioner for allotment of a sales tax deduction account number. The number shall be quoted in such documents, statements and returns as may be prescribed. (9) Where tax is deductible at the source by any employer, the person making the said supply shall not be called upon to pay tax himself to the extent to which the tax has been deducted in respect of the said supply.

DISCLAIMER The first departmental draft of the proposed Maharashtra Value Added Sales Tax Act, 2002 was put up on the inter-net in the first week of October 2001. Trade and industry associations, tax practitioners and members of the public were requested to send their suggestions and objections. A large number of replies and comments were received. Informal discussions regarding the provisions contained in the proposed draft were held with various individuals, associations, tax practitioners and officers from the department. The first draft has been extensively revised on the background of the comments and discussions. It has now been submitted to the State Government. It is requested that suggestions regarding the revised draft may be sent to the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Maharashtra State, Vikrikar Bhavan, Mazgaon, Mumbai - 400 010 or Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax (HQ) 1, R. No. 105, 1st floor, Vikrikar Bhavan, Mazgaon, Mumbai - 400 010 or on e-mail address 1.vikrikarmaha@yahoo.co.u k 2.vikrikarmaha@hotmail.com. After considering the suggestions received, the cabinet will give its decisions thereon. A Bill to give effect to the decisions of the cabinet will be prepared thereafter and submitted to the legislation. The revised second draft may not be considered to be an earlier version of the Bill. THE NEED FOR CHANGE The existing structure of the Sales Tax Department and the provisions of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 treat assessment as the central function of the department. The first premise is that every dealer should be assessed every year by calling him with his books of account. Tax demands are raised by passing statutory orders. The tax is collected on a single point first stage system. There is considerable litigation. By and large manual systems are in use. BLUE PRINT OF THE PROPOSED CHANGE. In view of the decision to collect tax on the value added principle, it becomes necessary to make certain changes in the statutory provisions. It is however desirable to take this opportunity to restructure the department, and change the content of the work and alter the job descriptions. A major shift of this type will be possible only if the departmental functions are supported by automation at every stage. As per the present provisions contained in the draft, it is proposed to link survey and registration. The registering authority will be in charge of the survey of unregistered dealers in his jurisdiction. The registered dealers will be required to file periodic tax returns. Every registered dealer will be required to file an annual return along with certain specified annexure. The assessing officer will scrutinise the annual return and annexure. If he notices any defect, he will issue a defect memo to the dealer and get the mistake corrected. Thereafter in each case an intimation letter will be issued to the dealer, stating therein whether any amount is due from the dealer or whether any refund is due to him. A demand notice or as the case may be, a refund order will also be issued along with the intimation letter. In a select number of cases, dealers will be called with books of account for assessment. The new and important features of the draft include self assessment, advance ruling, automation and simplified procedures. The number of tax rates will be very few. Certain classes of commodities will be taxed @ NIL, 1%, and 4%. The classification will follow a national consensus on the subject. A few luxury items will be taxes @ 20%. Motor spirits will continue to be taxed at the present rates. All other commodities will be taxed at a standard revenue neutral rate. All traders will be entitled to claim full set-off of the tax paid on their purchases of goods, which are resold. Similarly, manufacturers will be entitled to claim full set-off of the tax paid on purchases of raw materials, consumables and capital assets used in manufacturing. PROCEDURES AND RULES The draft rules are likely to be made available for public scrutiny in the next few days . SUGGESTIONS AND OBJECTIONS. The suggestions and objections on the second draft of the proposed Act may be sent to the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Maharashtra State, Vikrikar Bhavan, Mazgaon, Mumbai-10 or Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax (HQ) 1,R.No.105,1st floor, Vikrikar Bhavan, Mazgaon, Mumbai-10 or on e-mail address 1.vikrikarmaha@yahoo.co.uk 2.vikrikarmaha@hotmail.com , so as to reach him before the 15th January 2002.
