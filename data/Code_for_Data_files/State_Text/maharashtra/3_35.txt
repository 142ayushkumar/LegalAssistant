Before granting bail the special court will take into account many factors, such as- 1) The opportunity must be given to the public prosecutor to oppose the bail; 2) The court first must ensure that the accused, if released on bail shall not indulge in my unlawful activity; and 3) The most important factor is that the court must be satisfied that the accused who was arrested for crime under this act, was not on bail for any other crime under this or any other act, when the crime under inquiry was committed. Section 27 has made it compulsory to submit detailed annual report on interceptions of messages, to both the houses of legislature secret matters have been allowed to be dropped from such report. Sections 28 and 29 empower the high Court and the Government to make necessary rules under this Act.
