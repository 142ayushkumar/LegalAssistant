WHEREAS, it is the policy of Government to abolish inami and special tenures on which lands are held, and to subject those lands to ordinary land revenue; AND WHEREAS, in pursuance of the said policy, enactments have been passed by the State Legislatures throughout the State; AND WHEREAS, in accordance therewith it has been proposed to abolish inami tenure and certain special tenures created by former Governments in the City of Bombay, and for that purpose Bills were prepared and published; AND WHEREAS, representations, comments and criticism were received from various persons, bodies and associations; AND WHEREAS, it was decided thereafter that the proposals in the said Bills and the representations, comments and criticism received should be considered by an Expert Committee consisting of officials and non-officials, the terms of reference to which also required the consideration of the impact of the proposals on the Industrial, social and economic life of the City; AND WHEREAS, the Expert Committee appointed, decided by a majority that there was no justification for the continuance of the inami and special tenures in the city, but has strongly recommended that to cushion the effect of the impact of such abolition and to redress hardship that would arise in consequence of the imposition immediately on these lands of land revenue at the present market value of lands, it is necessary to impose a rate of assessment at a lower rate, to levy assessment on a graduated scale and to specify the principles of such assessment in the Act itself, and not leave it to the discretion of the Collector subject only to the orders of the State Government; AND WHEREAS, for reasons, industrial, economic and otherwise, it is reasonable and proper to accept the main recommendations of the Committee, and to declare the aforesaid tenures to be abolished; AND WHEREAS, if as recommended by the Expert Committee the principles of assessment in regard to the said lands are to be specified in the proposed legislation, it is considered necessary that the principles of assessment in regard to other lands in the City should in like manner be specified in Chapter XIV of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 itself. NOW, THEREFORE, it is expedient in the public interest to abolish inami tenure and certain special tenures; to amend the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 , and to make provision for matters connected with the purposes aforesaid; it is hereby enacted in the Twentieth Year of the Republic of India as follows:- (Received the assent of the President on 29th August 1969; assent was first published in the Maharashtra Government Gazette, part IV on the 4th September 1969).
