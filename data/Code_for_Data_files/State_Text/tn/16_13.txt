Dharapuram, Udumalpet and Pollachi for the extension of existing ayacut of the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project, so that more drought prone areas can have the benefit of irrigation; And Whereas the Government have approved the extension of ayacut under Parambikulam-Aliyar Project by 1,75,000 acres of land in the above said taluks; And Whereas the Government have issued order in G.O.Ms.No.126, Public Works Department, dated the 29th day of January 1976 adding 1,15,000 acres of land to the irrigation system covered by Parambikulam-Aliyar Project; And Whereas two writ petitions were filed in the High Court, Chennai in W.Ps.No.575/78 and 1309/78 against the said order and the High Court has directed that before supplying water to the new ayacutdars in the extended ayacut, the original ayacutdars are first assured of supply of sufficient water subject to availability once in eighteen months, as reguarly as possible or practicable; And Whereas in view of the above direction of the High Court, Chennai, the Government have called for a detailed report from the Chief Engineer (Irrigation) who has reported that with the available water potential, water can be supplied to the extended area by dividing the entire ayacuts into four zones, each zone getting water for a period of 4.5 months to 6 months once in two years and therefore has suggested that water may be supplied to the new ayacuts of 1.75 lakhs acres of land from the said project: And Whereas the Government have after carefully considering the report of the Chief Engineer (Irrigation) and after obtaining the opinion of the experts in this matter, accepted the proposal for re-zoning the ayacuts covered by Parambikulam-Aliyar project into four zones as feasible; And Whereas the Government, after taking into consideration the aforesaid factors, have decided to provide irrigation facilities under Parambikulam-Aliyar Project dividing the whole area into four zones, providing irrigation to each zone once in two years as against the existing three zones providing irrigation to each zone once in 18 months, in view of the drought prone nature of the area and in view of the infrastructural facilities already created in the said Project incurrin huge expenditure; Be it enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tamil Nadu, in the Forty-fourth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-
