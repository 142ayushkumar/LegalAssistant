Tamil Nadu Panchayats (Third Amendment) Act, 2006_Section Preamble--> State(s): Tamil Nadu An Act further to amend the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994. BE it enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tamil Nadu in the Fifty-seventh Year of the Republic of India as follows: Statement of Object The term of office of the Special Officers appointed under section 9-A of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994 (Tamil Nadu Act 21 of 1994) in respect of Kottakatchiyendal and Nattarmangalam village panchayats and the Special Officers appointed under section 261 of the said Act in respect of Keeripatti and Pappapatti village panchayats were due to expire on 24th April 2006. 2. In view of the General Elections to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, the election process for holding ordinary election to constitute Kottakatchiyendal, Nattarmangalam, Keeripatti and Pappapatti village panchayats had not been resorted to. Hence, it became necessary to extend the term of office of the Special Officers of the said village panchayats beyond the 24th April 2006. The Government, therefore, decided to extend the term of office of the Special Officers of the aforesaid village panchayats for a further period of six months beyond the 24th April 2006 and to amend sub-section (2) of section 9-A and sub-section (2) of section 261 of the said Act, suitably, for the purpose. Accordingly, the Tamil Nadu Panchayats (Fourth Amendment) Ordinance, 2006 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 1 of 2006) was promulgated by the Governor on the 24th April 2006 and the same was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 24th April 2006. The said Ordinance could not be replaced by an Act of the Legislative Assembly. Therefore, the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 9-A and sub-section (2) of section 261 of the said Act as so amended by the said Ordinance ceased to operate with effect on and from the 29th June 2006. As a result, the Special Officers of the said village panchayats are functioning without any authority, 3. Now, therefore, the Government have decided to extend the term of office of the Special Officers appointed under section 9-A of the said Tamil Nadu Act 21 of 1994 in respect of Kottakatchiyendal and Nattarmangalam village panchayats and the Special Officers appointed under section 261 of the said Act in respect of Keeripatti and Pappapatti village panchayats with effect on and from the 25th day of April 2006 for a further period of six months by amending the said Act suitably for the purpose and to validate anything done or any action taken by the Special Officers of the said village panchayats with effect on and from the 25th day of April 2006. 4. The Bill seeks to give effect to the above decision. M.K. Stalin, Minister for Rural Development and Local Administration. M. Selvaraj, Secretary.
