Consequent upon this, 237 Engineering Colleges, which were earlier affiliated to various Universities in the State, were affiliated to the Anna University; AND WHEREAS in December 2006, after the Anna University became the affiliating type University, it was realized that managing the affairs of more than 240 engineering colleges across the State from Chennai was difficult.
