Tamil Nadu Sales Tax (Settlement of Arrears) Amendment Act, 2010_Section Preamble--> State(s): Tamil Nadu An Act to amend the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax (Settlement of Arrears) Act, 2010 . BE it enacted by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tamil Nadu in the Sixty-first Year of the Republic of India as follows:- Statement of Object In order to provide a scheme for settlement of arrears of tax, penalty and interest under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax, Central Sales Tax and allied Acts, for which assessments has been made prior to the 1st day of April 2007, the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax (Settlement of Arrears) Act, 2010 (Tamil Nadu Act 20 of 2010) was enacted. Some of the traders have now represented to the Government that the scheme may be made applicable to all the arrears pertaining to the assessment years upto 2006-2007 even though the assessments were finalized after the cut off date of 31-3-2007. Considering those representations and also the fact that the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006 has come into force from 1-1-2007, it is felt that carrying the old arrears into the new tax regime further will not only burden the department, but also the maintenance and collection of the said arrears would not be cost effective. The Government have, therefore, decided to amend the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax (Settlement of Arrears) Act, 2010 (Tamil Nadu Act 20 of 2010) so as to extend the benefit of settlement of arrears of tax, penalty and interest under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax, Central Sales Tax and allied Acts upto the assessment year 2006-2007 in respect of which assessments have been made prior to the 1st day of June 2010. 2. Accordingly, the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax (Settlement of Arrears) Amendment Ordinance, 2010 (Tamil Nadu Ordinance 5 of 2010) was promulgated by the Governor on the 23rd October 2010 and the same was published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated the 25th October 2010. 3. The Bill seeks to replace the said Ordinance. S.N.M. UBAYADULLAH, Minister for Commercial Taxes. M. SELVARAJ, Secretary.
