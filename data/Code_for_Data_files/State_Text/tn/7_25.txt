The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax (Second Amendment) Bill, 1986 (L.A. Bill No. 53 of 1986) (Tamil Nadu Government Gazette, Extraordinary No. 245, Part IV, Section 1, dated 14th May, 1986, page 370.), runs as follows :- "There is no provision for appeal in section 31 and 31-A against an order passed under section 12-A of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 1 of 1959). As an order passed under section 12-A is an order of assessment or reassessment similar to an order passed under sections 12, 14 and 16 of the said Act, it is considered that provision should be made in sections 31 and 31-A for appeal against an order passed under section 12-A of the said Act. 2. The existing provisions in the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959 (Tamil Nadu Act 1 of 1959), to check goods vehicles are not adequate and give scope for evasion as checking of cycles and bullock-carts does not come under the purview of the said Act. Hence, it is considered necessary to bring cycles, bicycles, tricycles and bullock-carts also under the purview of goods vehicles. 3. The Government have, therefore, decided to amend the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959, suitably so as to make necessary provisions in sections 31 and 31-A for appeal against an order passed under section 12-A and to include motor vehicle, vessel, animal and any other form of conveyance within the scope of the expression 'goods vehicle' for the purpose of sections 42, 44 and 45 of the said Act. 4. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects."
