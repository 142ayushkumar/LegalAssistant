Chennai Metropolitan Area Groundwater (Regulation) Act, 1987_Section Preamble--> State(s): Tamil Nadu An Act to regulate and control the extraction, use or transport of ground water and to conserve groundwater in certain areas in the State of Tamil Nadu. WHEREAS there is often acute scarcity of water due to consecutive failure of monsoon rains.

AND WHEREAS the United Nations Mission which investigated the possibility of supplementing water supply to Chennai has recognised that a better economic answer might lie in the development of groundwater potential and had identified the Minjur, Duranallur - Panjetti and Tamaraipakkam-Kilanur Well fields in the Arni-Korteliyar basin. The Poondi, Korteliyar Flood Plains and Kannigaipper aquifers and also Poonamalle-Porur aquifer in Cooum-Adayar basin as having ground water for extraction.

AND WHEREAS based on the United Nations Development Programme studies, a scheme for artificial re-charge of the Arni-Korteliyar basin with excess flood water flowing into the sea is to be taken up by interlinking Ami and Korteliyar at two or more feasible points and also by constructing sufficient number of check dams at the appropriate places in the Korteliyar river course. AND WHEREAS such re-charge will enable optimum utilisation of ground water and formation of a hydraulic barrier against seawater instruction. AND WHEREAS the Government have, after careful examination of all aspects, decided that it is necessary in the public interest to regulate and control the extraction and use of groundwater in any form and to conserve the groundwater in the City of Chennai and certain revenue villages in the district of Chengalpattu and to regulate and control the transport of groundwater.
